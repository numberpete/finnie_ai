==Other retirement milestones==

*35 years of full time work.
Your Social security benefits are calculated on your top 35 years of earning adjusted for inflation. After 35 years of full time work you will not have any zero years so working more may have minimal impact on your Social security benefits.

Significant financial life events:
*When your pension and employer retirement plan contributions become vested. 
*When mortgage will be paid off.
*When children will be in college.
*When kids move out and become financially independent.
*Child's wedding as a possible large expense.

==Special cases==
Money you contributed to a 403(b) before January 1 1987 has special RMD rules that may be to your advantage.

      <text bytes="12803" sha1="lc32desv3v9bctvm0jvq3wil4reqizd" xml:space="preserve">There are many '''retirement risk''' factors to consider when [[:Category:Retirement planning|retirement planning]]. Many suggestions come from surveys, which can only represent general cases at best. Use this article as a guide. The best way to manage [[Risk and return: an introduction|risk]] is to plan for every ''possibility'' (can it occur), regardless of the ''probability'' (will it occur). If applicable, your planning should include a spouse or partner.

==Deciding on a retirement age==
When planning for retirement, one of the most critical decisions is the age at which you will start to transition to the retirement phase. Surveys suggest that most people expect to retire at the same age as their parents. There is also an expectation that your standard of living will be the same after retirement as during the working phase. In such a ''Voluntary Retirement'' scenario, you can develop financial plans that indicate how much to save each year in order to achieve your desired post-retirement standard of living. These plans usually assume that you will stay in your current job until retirement, along with a slowly rising annual income.

===Involuntary retirement===
Premature, ''involuntary retirement'' can seriously disrupt plans developed based on a voluntary retirement scenario. The risk of involuntary retirement is higher that many people realize: as many as 25%&lt;ref name="hurst"&gt;Erik Hurst, [http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/erik.hurst/research/retirement_consumption_survey_wharton.pdf Understanding Consumption in Retirement: Recent Developments], Chapt. 3 in '''Recalibrating Retirement Spending and Savings''' (eds. [[John Ameriks]] and Olivia Mitchell), Oxford University Press (2008) pp 29-45.&lt;/ref&gt; to 28%&lt;ref name="Lachance"&gt;Marie-Eve Lachance and Jason S. Seligman, [http://glennschool.osu.edu/faculty/seligman/2009%2010%20Lachance%20&amp;%20Seligman%20--%20Involuntary%20Retirement.pdf Involuntary Retirement: Prevalence, Causes and Impacts], Paper presented at the annual meeting of the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management -APPAM (2009), 47p.&lt;/ref&gt; of retirements fall into this category. The major factors contributing to this risk are the following:&lt;ref name="Process6"&gt;[http://www.soa.org/files/pdf/research-key-finding-process-planning.pdf Key Findings and Issues–Process of Planning and Personal Risk Management PDF], page 6.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Decline in personal health, leading to the inability to continue working
*The need to quit working in order to take care of a family member
*Unexpected, extended job loss, especially when due to economic recessions. Note that even if you can quickly find a new job, it might pay substantially less than your previous one. This can lead to a lower earning potential at the most critical phase of retirement savings - just before retirement.

The prospect of an earlier-than-planned retirement creates a nasty shock for the potential retiree. Because there are fewer years left to accumulate retirement assets than planned, your annual savings must become substantially larger.&lt;ref name="Process6" /&gt; This can seriously disrupt your pre-retirement lifestyle. And if you cannot accumulate enough savings, you must reduce your post-retirement standard of living. In fact, involuntary retirement is typically associated with a sharp drop in retirement spending.&lt;ref name="hurst"/&gt; 66% of involuntary retirees report being bothered somewhat or a lot by not having enough income, whereas only 21% of voluntary retirees report similar feelings.&lt;ref name="Lachance"/&gt;

===Voluntarily delaying retirement===
There are financial advantages to delaying retirement. In 2007, and again in 2009, the Society of Actuaries asked retirees if their financial security would have increased by delaying retirement for 3 years.&lt;ref name="Process10"&gt;[http://www.soa.org/files/pdf/research-key-finding-process-planning.pdf Key Findings and Issues–Process of Planning and Personal Risk Management PDF], page 10.&lt;/ref&gt; The most significant reason pre-retirees offered for delaying retirement is so they can continue receiving employer-provided health insurance; a significant benefit for those not yet eligible for Medicare. Other reasons for delaying retirement included:
*Increasing the amount received from [[Social Security]]
*Increasing the amount received from a [[defined benefit pension plan]]
*Having 3 more years to make contributions to investments
*Relying on your savings for a shorter period of time

The study found that pre-retirees were more likely than retirees to think that the factors listed above would increase their retirement security. In reality, financial security depends on individual factors.&lt;ref name="Process10" /&gt; As detailed [[:#Managing financial risk | below]], for actual retirees, working longer is not a popular choice.

If you would like to work for longer, it is also important to plan realistically. You will need to keep your skills up-to-date, and maintain coworker networking keep pace with the workforce.&lt;ref name="Process6"&gt;[http://www.soa.org/files/pdf/research-key-finding-process-planning.pdf Key Findings and Issues–Process of Planning and Personal Risk Management PDF], page 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Retirement risk concerns==
According to a survey by the Society of Actuaries (2009), the top risk concerns for retirees are:&lt;ref name="Full15"&gt;[http://www.soa.org/files/pdf/research-2009-retire-risk-survey.pdf 2009 Retirement Risk Survey], full report, page 15.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Health care: Inadequate funds to pay for health care and long-term care (highest concern)&lt;ref name="Full17"&gt;[http://www.soa.org/files/pdf/research-2009-retire-risk-survey.pdf 2009 Retirement Risk Survey], full report, page 17.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Income volatility: retirement income will vary with interest rate (highest concern - tied with health care)&lt;ref name="Full17" /&gt;
*Inflation: savings and investments may not keep up with inflation
*Preserving the existing standard of living, including concerns to provide for a surviving spouse

Lesser concerns are for remaining in an existing home, providing for heirs, or being forced to rely on assistance from family members.&lt;ref name="Full15" /&gt;

==Managing financial risk==
In this same 2009 survey, the most popular strategies to manage financial risk are:&lt;ref name="Full20"&gt;[http://www.soa.org/files/pdf/research-2009-retire-risk-survey.pdf 2009 Retirement Risk Survey], full report, page 20.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Debt reduction; most notably the elimination of consumer debt and paying off the mortgage
*Increase saving
*Reduce spending

Asset management strategies are also used as retirees age. The most popular strategies are to move assets into more conservative investments and to invest a portion of assets into stock or stock mutual funds. Less popular strategies include investing in real estate, purchasing an annuity, or choosing an employer plan that provides guaranteed income for life. Very few retirees choose to reduce risk by delaying Social Security, moving to a less expensive home, or working longer.&lt;ref name="Full20" /&gt;

==Managing health risk==
By far the most common strategy retirees use for managing health risk is to maintain a healthy lifestyle. Next in popularity is buying health insurance to supplement Medicare or participate in an employer-sponsored retiree health plan.&lt;ref name="Full23"&gt;[http://www.soa.org/files/pdf/research-2009-retire-risk-survey.pdf 2009 Retirement Risk Survey], full report, page 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other strategies include:&lt;ref name="Full23" /&gt;
*Self-insuring: Saving for the possibility of large health expenses or long term care
*Purchasing long-term care insurance
*Arrangements with a continuing care retirement facility (less popular)

==Application of risk management strategies==
Risk management strategies start with identifying risk events that apply to your unique situation. Relying on survey data or other research is a good start. Understand that this information 1) may not apply to your situation and 2) may use different assumptions that can lead you astray.

Then for each risk event, choose an appropriate risk management strategy and incorporate it into a retirement spending plan (see the sidebar on the right). Regardless of whether a risk is possible or not (''can'' it occur), having a plan prepared in advance is time well spent when a low probability risk unexpectedly occurs in reality.

One technique to incorporate these events is to plan for a "risk-free" retirement. Then, extend the budget for each risk scenario. You can do this in a spreadsheet by adding columns for each scenario and copying the formulas across. Reduce each category by a percentage. For example, if one spouse is disabled, car expenses go to 50%.

You should '''prepare for retirement''' well in advance of beginning your actual retirement. Navigating the myriad of available information can be a daunting experience. Where should you start?

We often recommend the [[Bogleheads' Guide to Retirement Planning]], along with selections from [[Book recommendations and reviews]] and [[Taylor Larimore's Investment Gems]]. In addition, a [[Retirement policy statement]] can help you lay out your plans.

===Taking the mystery out of retirement planning===
Below is a summary of [https://www.dol.gov/sites/default/files/ebsa/about-ebsa/our-activities/resource-center/publications/taking-the-mystery-out-of-retirement-planning.pdf Taking The Mystery Out Of Retirement Planning].

This booklet uses three time periods in charting your retirement savings. The starting point is today, when you are about 50 to 56 years old and plan to work approximately 10 to 15 years more. This is a good time to take stock of where you are in terms of retirement savings and set financial goals you would like to achieve in the 10 to 15-year period you plan to work.

The second point in time is the day you retire, when you are about 65 to 66 years old. That period between now and then is an important one. In those (approximately 10 to 15) years, you will have time to put more of your paycheck to work in a retirement account. It will grow, not only from your additional savings, but also from the “miracle of compounding,” the world's greatest math discovery, according to everyone's favorite genius, Albert Einstein. This is the result of earnings from interest and from investments continually increasing the base amount.

Finally, the third time period used in this booklet is the approximately 30-year span you hope to enjoy retirement. It is the time period experts suggest you plan for, based on the average 65-year old American male living 17 more years and the average 65-year old female living 20 more years. These are only averages, so planning for 30 years will help you avoid outliving your income.

As you read through this booklet, keep an eye on the Timeline for Retirement that follows. Some of the terms, like "catch-up" retirement contributions beginning at age 50, may be new to you. The timeline offers some milestone opportunities to make changes so you can have the kind of retirement you want. The time to start is today.

While the Resources section contains a list of retirement calculators, a companion online worksheet planner to this brochure can found here: [http://askebsa.dol.gov/retirementcalculator/UI/general.aspx Interactive worksheets]. You can also find calculators in the wiki [[Retirement calculators and spending| here]].

A '''reverse mortgage''' allows homeowners 62 and older to withdraw a portion of home equity as income or a line of credit without selling the home or making monthly payments. In 2009, half of homeowners 62 or older had 55% or more of their net worth in home equity.&lt;ref name="report"&gt;[https://files.consumerfinance.gov/a/assets/documents/201206_cfpb_Reverse_Mortgage_Report.pdf "Report to Congress on Reverse Mortgages"], Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, June 28, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; A reverse mortgage has been described as a loan of last resort because it can mean fewer assets for the homeowner and heirs. When the last surviving borrower dies, sells the home, or no longer lives in the home as a principal residence, the loan has to be repaid. In certain situations, a non-borrowing spouse may be able to remain in the home. The first reverse mortgage in the United States was issued in 1961. In 1987 Congress passed a reverse mortgage pilot program called the Home Equity Conversion Mortgage Demonstration, signed into law in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/R44128 Congress.gov-HUD’s Reverse Mortgage Insurance Program: Home Equity Conversion Mortgages]&lt;/ref&gt;

Reverse mortgages saw abuses by lenders and earned a bad reputation when the housing bubble burst in 2008-2010.&lt;ref&gt;Carole Fleck, [https://www.aarp.org/money/credit-loans-debt/info-10-2009/reverse_mortgages_ripe_for_abuse.html "Reverse Mortgages Ripe for Abuse"], ''AARP Bulletin'', October 7, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.napsa-now.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/FACT-SHEET-Elder-Financial-Abuse_Reverse-Mortgage-Scams-06-13.pdf NAPSA-Reverse Mortgage Scams]&lt;/ref&gt; The number of reverse mortgages dropped from an annual peak of about 115,000 in 2009 to 30,000 in 2016, according to the Federal Housing Administration. Reverse mortgages are now regulated by the Federal Housing Administration and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. For FHA Home Equity Conversion Mortgages, the FHA covers any difference between the sale value and the mortgage balance, preventing "underwater" loans.&lt;ref&gt;John F. Wasik, [https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/23/your-money/the-quiet-comeback-of-reverse-mortgages.html?_r=0 "The Quiet Comeback of Reverse Mortgages"], ''The New York Times'', July 22, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three types or reverse mortgages: FHA Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM), single-purpose reverse mortgage, and proprietary reverse mortgage.&lt;ref name="ftc"&gt;Federal Trade Commission, [https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0192-reverse-mortgages "FTC Consumer Information: Reverse Mortgages"], retrieved July 23, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==FHA Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM)==
The Federal Housing Administration's (FHA's) Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM) is a federally-insured mortgage backed by the U. S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). This is the most common type of reverse mortgage. The loans can be used for any purpose. They are more expensive than traditional home loans or single-purpose reverse mortgages and the financing costs are higher, a factor if the home stay is short or the mortgage is small.&lt;ref name="ftc" /&gt;

{{quotation|
FHA Reverse Mortgages (HECMs) for Seniors&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, [https://consumer.ftc.gov/articles/reverse-mortgages "Reverse Mortgages"].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Borrower Requirements''' -- You must
* Be 62 years of age or older
* Own the property outright or paid-down a considerable amount&lt;ref group="note"&gt;"Considerable" is not defined, but factors into the required financial assessment. &lt;/ref&gt;
* Occupy the property as your principal residence
* Not be delinquent on any federal debt
* Have financial resources to continue to make timely payment of ongoing property charges such as property taxes, insurance and Homeowner Association fees, etc.
* Participate in a consumer information session given by a HUD-approved HECM counselor&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Search online for "HECM counselor" or call (800) 569-4287 toll-free. Counseling agencies usually charge a fee for their services, often around $125. This fee can be paid from the loan proceeds, and you cannot be denied for lack of fee.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Property Requirements''' -- The following eligible property types must meet all FHA property standards and flood requirements:
* Single family home or 2-4 unit home with one unit occupied by the borrower
* HUD-approved condominium project
* Manufactured home that meets FHA requirements

'''Mortgage Amount Based On''' -- The amount you may borrow will depend on:
* Age of the youngest borrower or eligible non-borrowing spouse
* Current interest rate
* Lesser of the appraised value or the HECM FHA mortgage limit of $1,209,750 (as of 2025) or the sales price
If there is more than one borrower and no eligible non-borrowing spouse, the age of the youngest borrower is used to determine the&lt;br&gt; amount you can borrow.

'''Financial Requirements''' 
* Income, assets, monthly living expenses, and credit history will be verified.
* Timely payment of real estate taxes, hazard and flood insurance premiums will be verified
*For adjustable interest rate mortgages, you can select one of the following payment plans:
** Tenure - equal monthly payments as long as at least one borrower lives and continues to occupy the property as a principal residence.
** Term - equal monthly payments for a fixed period of months selected.
** Line of Credit - unscheduled payments or in installments, at times and in an amount of your choosing until the line of credit is exhausted.
** Modified Tenure - combination of line of credit and scheduled monthly payments for as long as you remain in the home.
** Modified Term - combination of line of credit plus monthly payments for a fixed period of months selected by the borrower.
*For fixed interest rate mortgages, you will receive the Single Disbursement Lump Sum payment plan.

'''HECM Costs'''

You can pay for most of the costs of a HECM by financing them and having them paid from the proceeds of the loan. Financing the costs means that you do not have to pay for them out of your pocket. On the other hand, financing the costs reduces the net loan amount available to you.

The HECM loan includes several fees and charges, which includes: 1) mortgage insurance premiums (initial and annual) 2) third party charges 3) origination fee 4) interest and 5) servicing fees. The lender will discuss which fees and charges are mandatory.

You will be charged an initial mortgage insurance premium (MIP) at closing. The initial MIP will be .5 percent or 2.5 percent, depending on your disbursements. Over the life of the loan, you will be charged an annual MIP that equals 1.25% of the outstanding mortgage balance.

'''Mortgage Insurance Premium'''
You will incur a cost for FHA mortgage insurance. The mortgage insurance guarantees that you will receive expected loan advances. You can finance the mortgage insurance premium (MIP) as part of your loan.

'''Third Party Charges'''
Closing costs from third parties can include an appraisal, title search and insurance, surveys, inspections, recording fees, mortgage taxes, credit checks and other fees.

'''Origination Fee'''
You will pay an origination fee to compensate the lender for processing your HECM loan. A lender can charge the greater of $2,500 or 2% of the first $200,000 of your home's value plus 1% of the amount over $200,000. HECM origination fees are capped at $6,000.

'''Servicing Fee'''
Lenders or their agents provide servicing throughout the life of the HECM. Servicing includes sending you account statements, disbursing loan proceeds and making certain that you keep up with loan requirements such as paying real estate taxes and hazard insurance premium. Lenders may charge a monthly servicing fee of no more than $30 if the loan has an annually adjusting interest rate or has a fixed interest rate. The lender may charge a monthly servicing fee of no more than $35 if the interest rate adjusts monthly. At loan closing, the lender sets aside the servicing fee and deducts the fee from your available funds. Each month the monthly servicing fee is added to your loan balance. Lenders may also choose to include the servicing fee in the mortgage interest rate.}}

In general, the older you are and the more equity you have in your home, the greater the loan can be.&lt;ref name="ftc" /&gt;

One unusual suggestion for a reverse mortgage is for buying a new home to downsize:
{{blockquote|"Instead of eliminating debts, paying for healthcare or covering daily living expenses, you can also use a reverse mortgage to purchase a new home that better suits your needs. The advantage of using HECM for Purchase is that the new home is purchased outright, using funds from the sale of the old home, private savings, gift money and other sources of income, which are then combined with the reverse mortgage proceeds. This home buying process leaves you with no monthly mortgage payments."&lt;ref&gt;National Reverse Mortgage Lenders Association (NRMLA), [https://www.reversemortgage.org/About/Types-of-Reverse-Mortgages/HECM-Payment-Options HECM Payment Options], retrieved July 24, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Single-purpose reverse mortgage==
Single-purpose reverse mortgages are the least expensive option. They are offered by some state and local governments and non-profit organizations, but they are not available everywhere. These loans may be used only for the purpose specified by the lender, for example, home repairs, improvements, or property taxes. Low or moderate income homeowners can qualify for these loans.&lt;ref name="ftc" /&gt;

These loans are not widely available and make up a tiny percentage of the reverse mortgage market. They often go by another name, such as property tax deferral programs.&lt;ref&gt;''Investopedia'', [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/singlepurpose-reverse-mortgage.asp "Single-Purpose Reverse Mortgage"], retrieved July 23, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately half the states have some type of property tax deferral program.&lt;ref name="report" /&gt; Check the details for your state.

==Proprietary reverse mortgage==
Proprietary reverse mortgages are private loans backed by the companies that offer them. Higher-appraised homes might qualify for a bigger loan with a proprietary reverse mortgage. They are more expensive than traditional home loans or single-purpose reverse mortgages and the financing costs are higher, important if you plan to stay in your home for a short time or borrow a small amount.&lt;ref name="ftc" /&gt;

The loan size depends on the same factors as an HECM, but is limited only by the risk the lender is willing to take. These mortgages vanished after the housing bubble burst in 2008-2010, then returned when home prices rebounded. They are not as common as HECMs because they lack a secondary market for lenders, and cannot be easily secured by sale to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.&lt;ref&gt;''Investopedia'', [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proprietary-reverse-mortgage.asp "Proprietary Reverse Mortgage"], retrieved July 23, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reverse mortgage benefits==

* For retirees with most of their wealth tied up in home equity, a reverse mortgage can provide needed liquidity and help with ongoing expenses. A 2010 NMRLA survey reported 56% of seniors with a reverse mortgage would not be able to cover monthly expenses without it.&lt;ref&gt;[https://financialservices.house.gov/uploadedfiles/hhrg-112-ba04-wstate-pbell-20120509.pdf NRMLA - Testimony of Peter H. Bell, President &amp; CEO National Reverse Mortgage Lenders Association before the Subcommittee on Insurance, Housing &amp; Community Opportunity House Financial Services Committee]&lt;/ref&gt; Another study indicated that 1/3 of reverse mortgage holders used them for medical expenses while staying in their home.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.albany.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/Makoto%20Nakajima.pdf Reverse Mortgage Loans: A Quantitative Analysis]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Multiple consumer surveys have found consumers were generally satisfied with their reverse mortgages:
** A 2006 survey of borrowers by AARP showed 93 percent said their reverse mortgage had a "mostly positive" effect on their lives.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mtgprofessor.com/A%20-%20Reverse%20Mortgages/Reverse%20Mortgages%20Are%20Not%20the%20Next%20Subprime.html "Reverse Mortgages Are Not the Next Sub-Prime"], Mortgage Professor.com, January 25, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; 
** A 2010 National Reverse Mortgage Lenders Association survey of 600 seniors with reverse mortgages found that close to 80% reported their satisfaction with their reverse mortgage above six on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being the highest. 43% marked their satisfaction at a 10.  
** A 2016 survey of 1,761 households funded by The MacArthur Foundation also showed that 83% of seniors were satisfied or highly satisfied with their reverse mortgage.  
** A 2020 study by the Journal of Gerontology, which surveyed 1,088 older adults, found that seniors with reverse mortgages had higher housing and life satisfaction rates than seniors without them.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.financeofamerica.com/education/reverse-mortgages-reputation/ Finance of America - How reverse mortgages got such a bad reputation]&lt;/ref&gt; 

* A reverse mortgage, when set up early in retirement, can provide protection against sequence of return risks and allow for a greater withdrawal rate. Additionally, investors, who are comfortable with greater risk may choose to use a reverse mortgage early in retirement to increase their equity exposure, potentially leading to a greater legacy for future generations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.morningstar.com/personal-finance/don-graves-wade-pfau-how-home-equity-affects-retirement-planning Morningstar - Don Graves and Wade Pfau: How Home Equity Affects Retirement Planning]&lt;/ref&gt;

* Retirees are never at risk for more than the market value equity in their home. A reverse mortgage can serve as a form of longevity insurance, with the value of the loan exceeding the market value of the home but not being responsible for the shortfall.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.financialplanningassociation.org/article/journal/FEB17-enhance-lifetime-retirement-security-use-reverse-mortgages-or-immediate-annuities Financial Planning Association - To Enhance Lifetime Retirement Security, Use Reverse Mortgages or Immediate Annuities?]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cbsnews.com/news/can-you-outlive-a-reverse-mortgage/ CBS News-Can you outlive a reverse mortgage?]&lt;/ref&gt;
==Reverse mortgage criticism==
The most common criticism is that reverse mortgages are more expensive than traditional home loans and the financing costs are higher, including higher upfront fees and higher interest rates.&lt;ref name="ftc" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.consumerfinance.gov/ask-cfpb/how-much-does-a-reverse-mortgage-loan-cost-en-237/ CFPB-How much does a reverse mortgage loan cost?]&lt;/ref&gt; But other problems have been noted:
* Because there are no required mortgage payments, the interest is added to the loan balance each month. The rising loan balance can eventually grow to exceed the value of the home, particularly in times of declining home values or if the borrower continues to live in the home for many years.&lt;ref name="report" /&gt; That said, with an FHA-insured HECM the borrower can never owe more than the value of the property.
* Reverse mortgages can be confusing, and many obtain them without fully understanding the terms and conditions. In October of 2010, the National Reverse Mortgage Lenders Association (NRMLA) surveyed 600 owners with reverse mortgages across the U.S., and only 46% of respondents felt they understood the financial terms "very well" when they secured their reverse mortgage.&lt;ref&gt;[https://services.nrmlaonline.org/NRMLA_Documents/NRMLA_Poll_Presentation.pdf NRMLA - reverse mortgage study]&lt;/ref&gt; A Consumer Financial Protection Bureau report to Congress in 2012 stated that "government investigations and consumer advocacy groups raised significant consumer protection concerns about the business practices of reverse mortgage lenders and other companies in the reverse mortgage industry."&lt;ref name="report" /&gt;
* Information available to help consumers understand prices and risks, including federally required disclosures and counseling, are not sufficient to ensure that they are making good decisions.&lt;ref name="report" /&gt;
* Homeowners are taking out reverse mortgages at increasingly younger ages with more money upfront, exhausting their resources sooner.&lt;ref name="report" /&gt; 
* Boglehead poster White Coat Investor lists additional potential [https://www.whitecoatinvestor.com/the-problems-with-reverse-mortgages/ problems with reverse mortgages.] 

==Other options==
Unlike a reverse mortgage, the first two options require monthly repayments to the lender. A reverse mortgage is generally easier to qualify for than a home equity loan or home equity line of credit (HELOC), which require adequate income and credit scores.&lt;ref name="report" /&gt; The HELOC is more flexible than the home equity loan, and a less expensive way to borrow smaller amounts if the principal is paid back quickly. In general, a reverse mortgage is better for long-term income in spite of a reduced estate. A home equity loan or HELOC is better for short-term cash, if you can make monthly repayments and want to avoid selling.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Folger, [https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/101714/reverse-mortgage-or-home-equity-loan.asp "Reverse Mortgage Or Home-Equity Loan?"], ''Investopedia'', October 17, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Home equity loan===
A home equity loan is a "second mortgage", a lump sum paid back over a set time period, using the home as collateral. The loan is based on the difference between the homeowner's equity and the home's current market value. The mortgage also provides collateral for an asset-backed security issued by the lender and sometimes tax-deductible interest for the borrower. 

Interest rates on such loans are usually adjustable rather than fixed, but lower than standard second mortgages or credit cards. Loan terms are usually shorter than first mortgages.&lt;ref&gt;''Investopedia'', [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/homeequityloan.asp Home equity loan], retrieved July 23, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Home equity line of credit===
A home equity line of credit (HELOC) is more like a credit card that uses the home as collateral. A maximum loan balance is established, and the homeowner may draw on it at discretion. Interest is predetermined and variable, and usually based on prevailing prime rates. 

Once there is a balance owed, the homeowner can choose the repayment schedule as long as minimum interest payments are made monthly. The term of a HELOC can last anywhere from less than five to more than 20 years, at the end of which all balances must be paid in full. The interest is often tax-deductible, making it more attractive than some alternatives.&lt;ref&gt;''Investopedia'', [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/homeequitylineofcredit.asp Home equity line of credit], retrieved July 23, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Government benefit programs===
Many consumers considering a reverse mortgage may not realize they are eligible for government benefit programs. One reverse mortgage counseling agency reports finding other solutions for 50% of the potential borrowers it counsels. Available benefits include federal programs such as [[Planning for disabled adult children#Supplemental Security Income (SSI)|Supplemental Security Income (SSI)]] and state and local programs such as home energy assistance.&lt;ref name="ss"&gt;[https://www.cbsnews.com/news/will-a-reverse-mortgage-impact-your-social-security-or-medicare-benefits/ Will a reverse mortgage impact your Social Security or Medicare benefits?]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Taxes and government assistance==
Reverse mortgages have been suggested as a possible tool to lower income taxes in retirement (see [[Social Security tax impact calculator]]). Generally, money from a reverse mortgage is not taxable and does not affect Social Security or Medicare benefits.&lt;ref name="ftc" /&gt; Eligibility for certain government assistance programs may be limited.&lt;ref name="ss" /&gt;

{{quotation|"A reverse mortgage does not affect regular Social Security or Medicare benefits. '''However, if you are on Medicaid or Supplemental Security Income (SSI), any reverse mortgage proceeds that you receive must be used immediately. Funds that you retain count as an asset and could impact eligibility.''' For example, if you receive $4,000 in a lump sum for home repairs and spend it all the same calendar month, everything is fine. Any residual funds remaining in your bank account the following month would count as an asset. If the total liquid resources (including other bank funds and savings bonds) exceed $2,000 for an individual or $3,000 for a couple, you would be ineligible for Medicaid. To be safe, you should contact the local Area Agency on Aging or a Medicaid expert."&lt;ref&gt;National Reverse Mortgage Lenders Association (NRMLA), [https://www.reversemortgage.org/Get-Help/Most-Frequently-Asked-Questions#social "Most Frequently Asked Questions"], retrieved July 24, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; ''(emphasis added)''}}

      <text bytes="5667" sha1="pz9f1aouex7gcivndgzrsj43806kfoh" xml:space="preserve">The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a downloadable Excel spreadsheet created by a retiree for retirees. It models the most common financial aspects of a retiree and their spouse's lives, including pensions, Social Security benefits, living expenses, IRA Required Minimum Distributions, purchase of an annuity, sale of a house, and many other items including Federal and state income taxes. All of this data is used to create a model of their accounts over a period of 1 to 40 years.  

A feature of this model allows the user to compare their normal portfolio results with one that includes alternative choices, such as doing [[Roth IRA conversion|Roth IRA conversions]], choosing alternative [[Social Security]] starting ages and benefits, or buying a [[Immediate fixed annuity|Single Premium Immediate Annuity]].  The model was developed by forum member ''BigFoot48''.

==Downloading and support==
The first post in this {{Forum post|t=97352 |title=Retiree Portfolio Model}} contains the link for downloading the spreadsheet. Also use this topic to receive assistance or ask questions.

This model was created using Excel 2003 and is compatible with [http://www.libreoffice.org/discover/calc/ LibreOffice Calc] and possibly Google Sheets. All formulas and results are completely viewable and can be unprotected, allowing user customization.

==Methodology==
The user inputs ages, account balances, earnings rates, income sources, first year expense and escalation rate, and some common retirement events, such as inheritances, large expenditures, and the passing of a spouse.  The model calculates the after-tax results of these amounts and choices and provides summarizes of results, including graphs, and the complete details.  The alternative events can be selected to be included in a second model, otherwise identical to the default one, for a quick and easy comparison and analysis of these options.

A brief overview of the individual tabs and worksheets:

*'''Readme''' contains general information about the model, including information on Roth conversions, with links to some external sources of additional data, along with an quick start guide, links to other retirement forecasting models, and details of the history of changes to the model.
*'''Setup''' is where nearly all of the user's data is entered that is used by to calculate and model the future results. Major sections include Age and Year Factors, Portfolio Balances, Income including two alternative Social Security benefit starting ages and amounts, and an immediate annuity, Expenses and IRA Withdrawals, Special Events (inheritances, home sales, etc.), Income Taxes (joint or single), future Federal Tax Rate Changes, and Roth Conversions and Withdrawals. The model comes with a hypothetical example data set for a married couple, illustrating typical results and how Roth conversions, or alternative SS starting ages, will impact portfolio results. A narrative of the example data is also provided.
*'''Summary''' shows key elements of the Full and Base cases.
*'''Results''' contains key comparisons of data from the default (full) and Base cases, along with graphs of some of the data. A Summary shows the portfolio balance in both cases at the end of the selected period, along with important factors for each case such as Total Income after Taxes, Federal Taxes and IRA Required Minimum Distribution amounts.  Yearly amounts of key data from the cases is also shown. Detailed data on Roth conversions and alternative Social Security benefits is also provided. A section summarizing key data along with all the selected input factors is provided for storing results
*'''Details''' is the default yearly model (full case) of the input data, which optionally includes Roth conversion and withdrawal amounts, and alternative Social Security benefits. Using starting account balances and input factors for income, expenses, earnings rates, and typical changes that occur during retirement, it will calculate yearly income, expenses, taxes and portfolio balances during the selected modeling period. Major sections include Account Balances, Account Income and Earnings, Account Changes, Expenses, Tax Calculations, Summary of Account Changes, and Account Balances at End of Year.
*'''Base Case''' is the model of the user's input data without Roth conversions or the alternative Social Security benefits option. It is used to provide an instant analysis of doing Roth Conversions and/or choosing alternative SS benefits. If these features are not used in the default case, this portfolio results will be identical to the default (full) case. A comparison section shows the differences between the default and base cases is also provided on this page.
*'''Tax Tables''' contains the current year tax rates and brackets, exemptions and deductions, for filing jointly or single. Future year tax rates and brackets are shown, calculated using an average escalation factor.  Also included in this tab are other data tables, such as Life Expectancy, used in the modeling process.
*'''ORP Comparison''' is a page allowing a user to compare the results of the RPM model to [http://www.i-orp.com/ The Optimal Retirement Planner].

A '''Retirement Policy Statement (RPS)''' is a document designed to  clearly lay out your retirement plans, strategies, and the tools which will help you over the next 30 years. It is designed to be a living document which will need to be reviewed and revised regularly as goals change, laws are changed, or new challenges are encountered.

This article was inspired by {{cite web| url=https://www.morningstar.com/articles/808697/how-to-create-a-retirement-policy-statement| title=How to Create a Retirement Policy Statement| author=Christine Benz| publisher=Morningstar| date=October 8, 2021}}

* Forum member Woodspinner's document template with examples: ([https://docs.google.com/document/d/1X6eDaRfVRahDTxX3w3RQ98u6EO9v6QP6/edit?usp=sharing&amp;ouid=113970057270176572588&amp;rtpof=true&amp;sd=true Microsoft Word]), ([https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_QWOf1TndJGsBQqz-y3qyrmxaBBTa6v2/view?usp=sharing PDF])

== Benefits ==
A retirement policy statement offers the following benefits:
* Serves as a formal record of our intentions that can be reviewed and revised as needed.
* Framework for robust discussions on retirement goals, priorities and approaches.
* Agree on key metrics to monitor retirement feasibility and resilience.
* Provide clarity into some of the complexities of how retirement is going to work.
* Lay out strategies for dealing with unusual situations like unanticipated major expenses and severe market downturns.
* Identify key gaps in our understanding that need to be addressed over time .
* Assist family, friends, or an advisor in understanding our retirement plans, goals and priorities.
* Integral to a ''just-in-case-something-bad-happens'' document and someone else needs to start managing the finances.

== Format ==
Formatting considerations include:
* Focus on ''clearly'' describing the concepts and use a format that works for you and your family.
* Check for understanding and clarify as needed.
* Consider using graphics, charts or tables to enhance clarity.
* Regularly review and update the RPS as needed. Document the revisions and the reasoning.

A '''Required Minimum Distribution (RMD)''' is a mandatory minimum withdrawal from certain types of tax-advantaged retirement accounts, including [[Traditional IRA|Traditional IRAs]], [[SEP|SEP-IRAs]], [[SIMPLE IRA]]s, [[401(k)]]s, [[403(b)]]s, and governmental [[457(b)]] plans.  The purpose of RMDs is to ensure that retirement savings eventually become taxable income.  For the owner, they are calculated annually using the account balance and an estimate of life expectancy.  Most RMDs start when the owner turns 73, or age 75 beginning in 2033.&lt;ref name="IRSRBD&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/publications/p590b#en_US_2024_publink1000123320| title=Publication 590-B (2024), Distributions from Individual Retirement Arrangements| publisher=Department of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service| accessdate=October 10, 2025 |at=Your required beginning date}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In addition to being a retirement milestone, RMDs have implications for tax planning, estate planning, and financial compliance.  You can incur substantial penalties for failing to timely make RMDs.  

The rules around RMDs have evolved since their introduction in 1974. This article focuses on RMDs under current tax law for owners and beneficiaries who are individuals.

==When an RMD is required==

If you are the owner of a tax-advantaged retirement account, RMD rules are straightforward to apply. RMDs for beneficiaries are more nuanced, with many exceptions. The factors that determine when an RMD is required include:

* if the owner has passed away
* when the owner passed away
* type of account
* whether you are the owner or a beneficiary
* for beneficiaries, your relationship to the owner and when you inherited the account
* for workplace accounts, whether you are an owner of the business
* whether you are an eligible designated beneficiary (EDB):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/publications/p590b#en_US_2024_publink100090532| title=Publication 590-B (2024), Distributions from Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs)| at=Eligible designated beneficiaries |publisher=Internal Revenue Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;

**Anyone who is not more than 10 years younger than the owner

Designated beneficiaries are individuals who are named on an account as beneficiaries.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Beneficiaries that are entities (not persons), such as an estate, a non-see-through trust and charities, are non-designated beneficiaries. These entities are typically subject to distribution under the following rules.  If the owner died before their required beginning date, distributions use the 5-year rule.  If the owner died on or after the required beginning date, distributions use the non-recalculating life expectancy method using the owner's life expectancy.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the rules around RMDs refer to '''"RMD age"''', which varies based on the age of the owner or beneficiary.

====Year of owner's death====

It is possible that an RMD is required after the death of the owner.

If the owner dies on or after reaching their required beginning date, an RMD must be taken for the year of death. The beneficiary is responsible for withdrawing the RMD as if the owner were still alive.  This requirement applies event if the beneficiary is the surviving spouse who elects to treat the account as their own.

If the owner dies before reaching their required beginning date, no RMD is required for the year of death.  This is true even if the owner had already reached the age at which RMDs typically begin.

For owners who pass away on or after January 1, 2025, beneficiaries may complete RMDs on the later of the beneficiary’s year-of-death tax return deadline—generally April 15, including extensions—or December 31 of the year following the year of death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| author=Mike Rahn| date=December 19, 2024| title=RMD Regulations’ Year-of-Death Rules Yield Both Answers and Questions| url=https://thelink.ascensus.com/articles/2024/12/18/rmd-regulations-year-of-death-rules-yield-both-answers-and-questions| website=Ascensus}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For owners who passed away prior to January 1, 2025, beneficiaries must have completed all remaining RMDs by December 31 of the year of death. This could be difficult if the owner died late in the year. In these cases beneficiaries can request a waiver.&lt;ref name="IRS signals" /&gt;

====Required beginning date====

Owners may delay their first RMD until April 1 of the following year, which is called the '''required beginning date'''.&lt;ref name="IRSRBD"/&gt; Delaying the first RMD into the following year means two RMDs will be taken that year, which may unexpectedly move the owner into a higher tax bracket.

==Calculation==

Most retirement account custodians provide RMD calculators that are customized to your individual situation.

If an RMD is required, the amount can depend on:
* the calculation method
* your age
* whether you are married
* your spouse's age
* whether you are the owner or beneficiary

The IRS updated the life expectancy tables&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2020-11-12/pdf/2020-24723.pdf |title=Updated Life Expectancy and Distribution Period Tables Used for Purposes of Determining Minimum Required Distributions | publisher=Internal Revenue Service | date=November 12, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Tables I, II, and III) for RMDs calculated for 2022 and beyond.  The new tables reflect longer life expectancies and in most cases result in lower RMDs.  If you are calculating RMDs for years prior to 2022, use the appropriate year of IRS Publication 590-B.

===Entire Interest: What amount is used to calculate the RMD?===

The ending balance of your account as of December 31 of the previous year, with adjustments, is used to calculate your RMD.  This amount is called your ''entire interest''.  It is your ending balance, adjusted for any outstanding rollovers, asset transfers, or conversions completed during the prior year that are recharacterized to the current year.

=== Uniform Lifetime ===

If you are:
* an unmarried owner
* a married owner with a spouse 10 or fewer years younger than you, or
* a married owner whose spouse is not the sole beneficiary of their account

you use the [https://www.irs.gov/publications/p590b#en_US_2024_publink100090310 Table III (Uniform Lifetime)] to calculate your RMD.

The amount of the RMD is equal to the entire interest in your retirement account as of December 31 of the previous year,  divided by the owner's life expectancy factor according to  [https://www.irs.gov/publications/p590b#en_US_2024_publink100090310 Table III (Uniform Lifetime)]. Calculations for different scenarios are described below.

====Example====

Bill turns 73 in March of 2025. The combined balance of all of his non-inherited traditional, SEP, and SIMPLE IRAs on December 31, 2024 was $882,349. He is married, and his spouse is less than 10 years younger. [https://www.irs.gov/publications/p590b#en_US_2024_publink100090310 Table III (Uniform Lifetime)] shows a ''Life expectancy factor'' of '''26.5''' at age 73, and the RMD is calculated as:
:RMD = $882,349 / 26.5 = '''$33,296'''

This RMD may be taken as late as April 1, 2026.

=== Joint Life and Last Survivor ===

If you are an owner with a spouse more than 10 years younger than you, and your spouse is the sole beneficiary of your account, you use [https://www.irs.gov/publications/p590b#en_US_2024_publink100090290 Table II (Joint and Last Survivor Life Expectancy)] to calculate your RMD.  

The amount of the RMD is equal to the entire interest in your retirement account as of December 31 of the previous year,  divided by the owner's life expectancy factor according to [https://www.irs.gov/publications/p590b#en_US_2024_publink100089977 Table I (Single Life Expectancy)].

===RMDs by beneficiaries===

RMDs for accounts inherited by beneficiaries vary based on the date of death of the owner and the relationship between the owner and the beneficiary.  Depending on the situation, one or more of these RMD calculation methods can be used.  Use the tables earlier in this page to determine which methods are available.

====Single Life Expectancy====

The single life expectancy method spreads RMD payments over the owner or beneficiary's lifetime, depending on the scenario. The RMD amount is recalculated each year based on the projected remaining lifetime.

The amount of the RMD is equal to the entire interest in the retirement account, divided by the life expectancy factor according to [https://www.irs.gov/publications/p590b#en_US_2024_publink100089977 Table I (Single Life Expectancy)].

Because this method reflects increased life expectancy each year the owner or beneficiary lives, it provides lower RMDs than other calculation methods.

====Non-recalculating life expectancy====

The non-recalculating life expectancy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-prior/p590b--2019.pdf |title = Publication 590-B (2019) Distributions from Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs) | publisher=Internal Revenue Service | pages=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; method spreads RMD payments over a fixed RMD period starting in the year after the owner's death.  The number of years depends on whether the owner died on or after their required beginning date.

Reduce the RMD period by 1 for each year since the year following the owner's death.

This method fixes the remaining life expectancy of the beneficiary at the time of the owner's death, which results in higher RMDs than the single life expectancy method.

=====Example=====

Bob inherits a traditional IRA from his mother Agnes in 2019, which had a value of $100,000 as of December 31, 2019.  Agnes was 93 in 2019, which means she died after her required beginning date. In 2020, the year following Agnes' death, Bob is 64.  Using [https://www.irs.gov/publications/p590b#en_US_2024_publink100089977 Table I (Single Life Expectancy)], Agnes' life expectancy in 2019 was 4.6 and Bob's life expectancy in 2020 is 23.7.  Bob's life expectancy is larger, so it will be used for the calculation.

Bob's RMDs from Agnes' IRA start in 2020, the year after her death.  Bob's RMD is $100,000 / 23.7 = $4219.41.

At the end of 2020, Agnes' IRA has a value of $106,400.  Bob's life expectancy is reduced by 1, to 22.7.  Bob's RMD in 2021 is $106400 / 22.7 = $4687.22.

====10-year rule====
The 10-year rule requires the contents of an account to be distributed by December 31 of the year containing the 10th anniversary of the owner's death.  Under all circumstances the account must be emptied by the end of year 10.

For traditional accounts, if the owner dies on or after their required beginning date, annual RMDs are required using the longer of the non-recalculating life expectancy of the owner or the beneficiary. If the owner dies prior to their required beginning date, no RMDs are required.

For Roth accounts, no annual RMDs are required.

Some beneficiaries have the option of selecting either the 10-year rule or another calculation option.  It is usually best to select the option that spreads the RMDs over the largest number of years.  This usually means that the other option is better than the 10-year rule.

====5-year rule====
The 5-year rule requires the contents of an account to be distributed by December 31 of the year containing the 5th anniversary of the owner's death.  No annual RMDs are required.

=====Example=====

Alan inherits an IRA account from his uncle Bennett in 2019 as a designated beneficiary.  Bennett was 70 when he died, and had not yet reached his required beginning date.  Alan plans to work until the end of 2022, and for tax planning purposes wishes to empty the account in 2023 and 2024. Alan elects to take distributions using the 5-year rule on September 1, 2020, and must empty the account by December 31, 2024.

==Details==

RMDs have much in common with any other withdrawal from a tax-advantaged account (for example, withdrawals from a [[Traditional IRA]] with non-deductible basis are pro-rata). However, RMDs have several special properties:

*RMDs cannot be rolled back into tax-advantaged accounts (including by way of a [[Roth conversion]]), although they can be taken in-kind or reinvested in the same or similar investments inside a [[taxable account]].
*Withdrawals of more than the RMD amount in a given year do not carry forward to help satisfy RMDs in future years, although they will reduce the balance on which future RMDs are calculated.
*Beneficiaries are exempt from early withdrawal penalties for RMDs. Withdrawals by beneficiaries using the ten-year rule are also exempt from early withdrawal penalties.

===Combining distributions from multiple accounts ===

Under certain circumstances, a distribution from one account can be used to satisfy the RMD from a different account.

*RMDs from accounts you inherited cannot be combined with accounts you own.
*For IRAs you own, calculate the RMD separately for each IRA that they own.  You can withdraw the total amount from one or more of the IRAs.&lt;ref name="Cornell" /&gt;
*Workplace plans (e.g., 401(k)) may not be combined with other workplace plans or IRAs.
*Inherited IRA RMDs can only be combined if from the same decedent and subject to the same RMD calculation method (e.g., all 10-year rule).

*Multiple inherited IRA beneficiaries should split the IRA into separate interests so that each beneficiary can:
** Select a fiduciary of choice for investing the inherited IRA;
** Execute their own individual investment plan and account succession.  If an IRA having multiple beneficiaries is not split into separate accounts, the required minimum distribution is based on the life expectancy factor for the oldest beneficiary.
*A [[403(b)]] contract owner must calculate the RMD separately for each 403(b) contract that they own, but can take the total amount from one or more of the 403(b) contracts.&lt;ref name="Cornell" /&gt;

===RMDs and Roth conversions===

For each calendar year a RMD is required, the RMD must be the first money to leave the account. For example, if you wanted to perform a [[Roth conversion]] from a traditional IRA account in a calendar year that also has a RMD, the RMD must be completed ''before'' you perform a subsequent Roth conversion. If you reverse this sequence, the IRS will consider you to have improperly contributed RMD funds into the Roth account, and you will owe a 6% excise tax on the excess contribution, unless corrected before your tax filing deadline. This twist can cause particular problems for the year you turn your RMD age, since you have until April 1 of the following year to complete the RMD, but cannot perform a Roth conversion until the RMD is completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=April 4, 2023|title=Publication 590-A (2022), Contributions to Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs)|url=https://www.irs.gov/publications/p590a|access-date=May 20, 2023|publisher=IRS|series=Excess Contributions Tax}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;See the article [https://www.irahelp.com/slottreport/age-70-%C2%BD-confusion-retirement-accounts Age 70½ Confusion for Retirement Accounts] for an excellent discussion, with illustrative examples, of how RMDs can interact with Roth conversions, rollovers and direct trustee transfers.&lt;/ref&gt; 

If you have multiple IRAs, even if they are held at different custodians, the total aggregated required minimum distribution (RMD) for those IRAs must be withdrawn before any Roth IRA conversion (or 60-day rollover) can be completed.  It is not necessary to complete workplace retirement RMDs prior to the Roth conversion.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web|url=

===Qualified Charitable Distributions===
{{Main|Qualified charitable distributions}}

Qualified Charitable Distributions (QCDs) allow IRA owners and beneficiaries to satisfy part or all of their RMD by giving money directly to a qualifying non-profit organization. QCDs are limited to $105,000 in 2024 and $108,000 in 2025. For married joint filers, this limit applies separately to each spouse.

===Penalties===

The penalties for failing to take a RMD are large: 25% of the balance that should have been distributed. For this reason, correctly calculating and taking RMDs should be a top financial priority for those affected. Penalties for insufficient or late RMDs are assessed using [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f5329.pdf IRS Form 5329].  The IRS does sometimes waive such penalties.&lt;ref name="IRS signals"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://irahelp.com/irs-signals-it-will-still-waive-missed-rmd-penalties/| title=IRS Signals That It Will Still Waive Missed RMD Penalties| publisher=Ed Slott and Company, LLC| date=April 10, 2023| accessdate=October 19, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disabled or chronically ill beneficiaries===

To be considered disabled or chronically ill, beneficiaries must prove they are disabled or chronically ill at the time the account owner died.  Evidence must be submitted by October 31 of the year following the owner's death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://retirementlc.com/resources/disabled-and-chronically-ill-eligible-designated-beneficiaries/ | title=Disabled and Chronically Ill Eligible Designated Beneficiaries |publisher=Retirement Learning Center | date=November 25, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

===Example 1===

Alice is Bob's daughter. In 2022, Alice turned 35 and Bob turned 65, but he died before the end of the year. Alice was the sole beneficiary of Bob's [[traditional IRA]]. The IRA had a balance of $805,904 on December 31, 2021. Bob withdrew $25,000 in 2022 before he died, but this did not matter for RMD purposes because no RMD is required for 2022, whether or not Bob died. Alice is a non-designated beneficiary, and because Bob died before reaching his required beginning date, Alice has no RMD requirements. However, she is subject to the 10-year rule and must completely empty the IRA by Dec 31, 20'''32'''.

=== Example 2===

Angie is Barry's daughter, and Barry is unmarried. In 2025, Angie turned 45 and Barry turned 80, but he died before the end of the year. Angie was the sole beneficiary of Barry's traditional IRA. The IRA had a balance of $1,221,867 on December 31, 2024. Barry withdrew $45,000 in 2025 before he died. Barry's RMD is calculated for 2025 based on his age on his birthday in 2025 (80) and [https://www.irs.gov/publications/p590b#en_US_2024_publink100090310 Table III (Uniform Lifetime)], and is '''$60,488''' (= $1,221,867 / 20.2). Because Barry did not withdraw the full RMD before he died, Angie must withdraw the remainder of '''$15,488''' (= $60,488 - $45,000) before Dec 31, 202'''6''' (the end of the year after his death) to avoid penalties. Because Angie is not an eligible designated beneficiary, the ten-year rule applies. And, because Barry died after reaching his required beginning date, Angie must also take annual RMDs per the IRS guidance released in 2024. Her RMD in 2026 is calculated by the ''longer'' life expectancy from her age on her birthday in 2026 (46) and [https://www.irs.gov/publications/p590b#en_US_2024_publink100089977 Table I (Single Life Expectancy)], or Barry's age in the year he died (80) and [https://www.irs.gov/publications/p590b#en_US_2024_publink100089977 Table I (Single Life Expectancy)], minus one year. These two values are 40.0 and 10.2 (= 11.2 - 1) respectively. The account balance on Dec 31, 2025 is $1,338,942, so Angie's RMD in 2026 is '''$33,474''' (= $1,338,942 / 40.0), which must be taken out by Dec 31, 2026 in addition to the $15,488 remainder of Barry's 2025 RMD calculated above. The account balance on Dec 31, 2026 is $1,229,384, so Angie's RMD for 2027 is '''$31,523''' (= $1,229,384 / [40.0 - 1]). And, Angie must completely empty the IRA by Dec 31, 20'''35'''. 

===Example 3===
Ann is Brian's sister, and Brian is unmarried. In 2025, Ann turned 80 and Brian turned 75, but he died before the end of the year. Ann was the sole beneficiary of Brian's traditional IRA, which had a balance of $482,989 on December 31, 2024. The RMD for the IRA in 2025 is calculated as though Brian were alive the entire year, and is '''$19,634''' (= $482,989 / 24.6). Brian did not take any distributions before he died, so Ann is responsible for withdrawing at least this amount before Dec 31, 2026 (per IRS guidance from 2024) to avoid penalties. The balance on Dec 31, 2025 is $501,159. Ann qualifies as an eligible designated beneficiary because she is not more than 10 years younger than Brian. Ann's RMD for 2026 is calculated based on the ''longer'' life expectancy from her age on her birthday in 2026 (81) and [https://www.irs.gov/publications/p590b#en_US_2024_publink100089977 Table I (Single Life Expectancy)], or from Brian's age on the year of his death (75) and [https://www.irs.gov/publications/p590b#en_US_2024_publink100089977 Table I (Single Life Expectancy)], minus one year. These two values are 10.5 and 13.8 (= 14.8 - 1) respectively, so the RMD is '''$36,316''' (= $501,159 / 13.8). Ann must distribute a total of $55,950 (Brian's remaining RMD from 2025 and Ann's RMD from 2026) by Dec 31, 2026 to avoid penalties. The balance on Dec 31, 2026 is $472,262. For 2027, Ann's RMD is calculated based on the ''longer'' life expectancy from her age on her birthday in 2026 (81) and [https://www.irs.gov/publications/p590b#en_US_2024_publink100089977 Table I (Single Life Expectancy)], minus one year, or from Brian's age on the year of his death (75) and [https://www.irs.gov/publications/p590b#en_US_2024_publink100089977 Table I (Single Life Expectancy)], minus two years. These two values are 9.5 (= 10.5 - 1) and 12.8 (= 14.8 - 2) respectively, so the RMD is '''$36,895''' (= $472,262 / 12.8).

===Example 4===
Allison and Bill are married. In 2025, Allison turned 55 and Bill would have turned 75, but he died in 2025 before his birthday. Allison was the sole beneficiary of Bill's traditional IRA, and she elected to treat it as an Inherited IRA rather than her own, so she can take penalty-free withdrawals before age 59½. Even though she inherited the IRA after January 1, 2020, the SECURE Act provides an exception to the ten-year rule for surviving spouses electing to treat the IRA as their own (thus Allison is an eligible designated beneficiary), so the pre-SECURE Act Stretch IRA rules apply. The IRA had a balance of $1,221,867 on December 31, 2024. Bill's RMD for 2025 is as though he were alive for the entire year, and is calculated based on [https://www.irs.gov/publications/p590b#en_US_2024_publink100090290 Table II (Joint and Last Survivor Life Expectancy)] (ages 55 and 75) because his spouse is the sole beneficiary and more than 10 years younger. The RMD for 2025 is '''$37,712''' (= $1,221,867 / 32.4), and because Bill did not make any withdrawals in 2025 before his death, Allison is responsible for taking this entire withdrawal before Dec 31, 2026 (per IRS guidance from 2024) to avoid penalties. The balance on Dec 31, 2025 is $1,252,574. For 2026, Alice's RMD is based on the longer life expectancy of herself in 2026 (age 56) per [https://www.irs.gov/publications/p590b#en_US_2024_publink100089977 Table I (Single Life Expectancy)], or Bill's age on his birthday the year he died (75) per [https://www.irs.gov/publications/p590b#en_US_2024_publink100089977 Table I (Single Life Expectancy)], with one year subtracted. These two values are 30.6 and 13.8 (= 14.8 - 1). So, her RMD in 2026 is '''$40,934''' (= $1,252,574 / 30.6). The total amount Allison must withdraw by Dec 31, 2026, including Bill's 2025 RMD, is $78,646 (= $37,712 + 40,934). The balance on Dec 31, 2026 is $1,402,359. For 2027, Alice's RMD is based on the longer life expectancy of herself in 2027 (age 57) per [https://www.irs.gov/publications/p590b#en_US_2024_publink100089977 Table I (Single Life Expectancy)], or Bill's age the year he died (75) per [https://www.irs.gov/publications/p590b#en_US_2024_publink100089977 Table I (Single Life Expectancy)], minus two years. These values are 29.8 and 12.8 (= 14.8 - 2) respectively. So, her RMD in 2027 is '''$47,059''' (= $1,402,359 / 29.8).

==Managing RMDs==

For most retirees — especially in the early years — RMDs generally align with [[safe withdrawal rates]] and can serve as a practical source of income.  There is usually no need to avoid RMDs unless your retirement accounts are significantly larger than your expected spending.  Unwanted RMDs can often be mitigated via Roth [[Traditional versus Roth|contributions]]/[[Roth conversion|conversions]] and 
[[Qualified charitable distributions|Qualified Charitable Distributions (QCDs)]].

===RMDs throughout retirement===

The RMD amount varies each year based on investment performance.  This table shows the expected size of RMDs throughout retirement, adjusted for inflation, as a function of the overall account real rate of return, expressed as a percentage of the first-year RMD for an investor with an RMD age of 73.

For a reasonable rate of rate of return (up to ~5% real) and average life expectancy (for someone who has reached age 73, approximately 85 for a male and 87 for a female), RMDs should stay below about 200% of the first-year RMD. Many investors will have a high percentage of lower-risk lower-return investments like [[Bond basics|bonds]] and have RMDs stay even flatter. However, the combination of high returns and long life can produce some large RMDs. If this possibility is one you want to avoid, Roth conversions both before and during retirement will lower RMDs.

===RMDs versus annuitization===

The distribution rules were made more generous in recent years and appear to work better than many annuities. If only the RMD percentage is taken in bull or bear market years, the amount of money withdrawn will be increased some years and reduced some years but will theoretically never run out. Of course, a severe long term decline like the Japanese scenario might make the amount of money insufficient to support required retirement expenses. Portfolio allocations for retirees dependent upon investments for a significant portion of their living expenses should be conservative anyway (higher percentage of fixed income reducing the equity risk). Keeping investments in an IRA also lets you retain more flexibility than annuitization, for example by allowing adjustment of [[asset allocation]], reinvestment of unspent RMDs in a taxable account, leaving an IRA to a spouse who can treat it as their own, and leaving to non-spouse heirs with a 10-year stretch. 

The consensus opinion is that annuitization should only be considered when you have just about enough savings to provide for your desired retirement income, and want to purchase longevity insurance at the expense of leaving less money to heirs. See: [[Immediate fixed annuity]] for details on the trade-offs for annuitization.

===Disclaiming all or part of an inherited account===

Beneficiaries can manage RMDs by disclaiming all or part of their account.  The account then passes to the next eligible beneficiary on the account, and the new beneficiary becomes responsible for RMDs.  This can be particularly powerful if the new beneficiary is disabled or chronically ill, as the beneficiary in that situation can take RMDs over their single life expectancy.

===Tax management===
If your objective is minimizing taxes on RMDs, taking more than the RMD can make sense in some scenarios.

One example is the 10-year rule.  If the balance of the account is large enough to push you into a higher tax bracket in year 10, it's rarely the right decision to wait until year 10 to take distributions.  Instead, take the distributions over multiple years to minimize the tax impact.

[[Stretch IRA]] has an extensive discussion of tax management strategies.

=== Prefer in-kind distributions when possible ===

Consider this scenario:

:Sally is 75 years old and owns a traditional IRA and a brokerage account.  She holds VTI in the traditional IRA, has no need for additional cash, and would like to invest her RMD in VTI in her brokerage account.

In this scenario, Sally should transfer shares in-kind from her IRA, rather than selling VTI in the IRA, transferring cash, and buying VTI in her brokerage account.  Benefits of this approach include:

* Cleaner tax reporting
* Shares retain their original purchase date, for wash sale calculation purposes
* Money stays in market during RMD process

In-kind distributions and cash distributions are both taxed as ordinary income.  Shares distributed in-kind get a new cost basis equal to their fair market value when distributed.

==Individual Retirement Annuity==

Individual Retirement Annuity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Individual Retirement Annuity: What It Is and It Works| author=Julia Kagan| publisher=Investopedia | url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/individual_retirement_annuity.asp|access-date=October 12, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a type of IRA where the retirement account is funded through an annuity contract issued by an insurance company.  When calculating RMDs, the ''entire interest'' includes the value of any riders that provide additional benefits. Your insurance company will provide you with your ''entire interest'' if it is more than the ''account balance''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Qualified pension, profit-sharing, and stock bonus plans|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/401|access-date=September 10, 2025|series=26 USC §401(a)(9)(A)|publisher=Office of the Law Revision Counsel of the US House of Representatives}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Required minimum distributions from defined contribution plans|url=https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-26/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-1/subject-group-ECFR6f8c3724b50e44d/section-1.401(a)(9)-5|access-date=January 8, 2022|series=26 CFR §1.401(a)(9)-5(A-1)(a)|publisher=Code of Federal Regulations}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Required minimum distributions from defined contribution plans|url=https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-26/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-1/subject-group-ECFR6f8c3724b50e44d/section-1.401(a)(9)-5|access-date=January 8, 2022|series=26 CFR §1.401(a)(9)-5(A-1)(e)|publisher=Code of Federal Regulations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individual Retirement Annuity contracts do not use the RMD tables once you have purchased a lifetime annuity with regular payments, but do use the RMD tables based on the entire interest otherwise.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Details are in the Code of Federal Regulations, 26 CFR §1.401(a)(9)-5, [https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-26/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-1/subject-group-ECFR6f8c3724b50e44d/section-1.401(a)(9)-5 Required minimum distributions from defined contribution plans.], A-1.

An annuity can be a container for investments. It can also be a stream of payments. An annuity before you annuitize it is a container for investments. It becomes a stream of payments after it is annuitized.&lt;/ref&gt;

You have the option of emptying your account so you will have no further RMDs. For an Individual Retirement Account, you can withdraw all your money; for an Individual Retirement Annuity, you can purchase a life annuity with regular payments.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

A '''variable annuity''' is an insurance contract that delays payments of income (periodic or systematic withdrawals, or annuitized payouts) until the investor elects to receive them. This type of annuity has two main phases, the savings phase in which you invest money into the account, and the income phase in which the plan is converted into income and payments are received. Earnings within the contract are tax deferred, and are taxed upon withdrawal at income tax rates (similar to qualified retirement plans) and share with these plans the 10% early penalty tax for withdrawals made prior to age 59 and 1/2. If the annuity is held within a retirement plan it is known as a "qualified" annuity and distributions are totally taxable. If the annuity is purchased in the taxable account it is known as a "non-qualified" variable annuity and only the earnings are subject to tax. Variable annuity withdrawals are made on an earnings first, basis last principle. Variable annuities come with an array of insurance options, all of which add to the cost of investment in the contract.

==Variable annuity components==
===The variable account===
Investments in a variable annuity are placed in what is termed a Separate Account, which is an account segregated from an insurer's general account and is exempt from the insurer's creditors. The assets in the account are thus safe from an insurer's default. Investors are provided with a menu of subaccounts, pooled investment vehicles analogous to mutual funds, offering access to stocks, bonds, and money market instruments. 
The annuity investor's capital will fluctuate with the returns of the underlying subaccount investments. The terminology used in connection with a subaccount, along with the analogous mutual fund terminology is provided in the following table:&lt;ref name="vanguard"&gt;Vanguard Variable Annuity Prospectus, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;

Dividends and capital gains distributions do not add accumulation units to your subaccount; they are added into the accumulation unit value.

===The death benefit===
The basic insurance benefit associated with a variable annuity is the death benefit. The benefit assures the beneficiaries of the annuity a guaranteed payment if the contract owner dies prior to annuitizing the contract. The benefit is usually offered with variations. Fees for these benefits will be discussed later.
:*'''Return of premium''':The return of premium death benefit guarantees that the beneficiary will receive either the current market value of the contract or the premiums (net of any withdrawals) paid into the contract.
:*'''Stepped-up death benefit''': This death benefit guarantees the beneficiary will receive either the full account value at the time of death or the highest account value on any contract anniversary prior to death, whichever is greater.
:*'''Stepped-up benefit with accumulation''': This option guarantees the beneficiary will receive either the greater of the stepped up death benefit or the total contributions accumulated at a certain annual percentage rate, less any withdrawals.&lt;ref name="vanguard" /&gt;

===Living benefits===
Many variable annuities offer guarantee options to insure a given level of retirement income, or accumulation value. These guarantees come at an added cost. The main Living Benefit options include:
:*'''Guaranteed Minimum Income Benefit''': This option ensures that if you purchase a variable annuity during one of the financial market peaks and end up requiring retirement payments during one of the market’s troughs, you will still receive a predictable minimum level of retirement payments after a certain agreed-upon date.  Should the underlying investments perform well, then your payments may be higher than this guaranteed amount.  To initiate the guaranteed minimum income benefit, you must annuitize the contract. 
:*'''Guaranteed Minimum Accumulation Benefit''': This optional feature protects your contribution against market volatility.  Typically, a portion of your original contribution is invested in a fixed interest account that is guaranteed to grow to the size of your principal after a specified period of time, while the remainder is invested in variable investment portfolios. Some versions of this benefit, in addition to guaranteeing your principal or original contribution, also guarantee a certain minimum level of accumulation.
:*'''Guaranteed Minimum Withdrawal Benefit''': This optional benefit guarantees that regardless of market performance, you will be able to receive at least the entire amount of your total principal investment through a series of annual withdrawals – provided that you do not withdraw more than a specified percentage of your total investment in any given year.  Some variable annuities are now offering this benefit with the guarantee that you can make withdrawals for as long as you live.&lt;ref name="lambert"&gt;Georgg D.Lambert. [http://www.investopedia.com/articles/pf/06/variableannuity.asp?viewed=1 The Cost Of Variable Annuity Guarantees]&lt;/ref&gt;
:*'''Guaranteed Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit (GLWB)''':The GLWB guarantees that you can withdraw a minimum amount throughout your lifetime - regardless of the subaccounts' performance - and you don't have to annuitize your contract. The guarantee is a set percentage of your investment, which increases the longer you delay taking payments. For example, the company might agree to pay you 5% at age 55. But if you wait until you are 70 to begin taking income, the company might increase that to 5.5%. At age 80, it could be 6%.&lt;ref name="lambert" /&gt;

==Variable annuity expenses==
{{Notice|Each of the above features and options are available for a fee. In 2011, Morningstar reports the average cost of a variable annuity as 2.49%. The accumulation of fees and surrender charges can make the average VA a prohibitively expensive investment vehicle.  Investors can reduce the costs associated with a VA by directly investing in a no-load, no surrender fee VA with low insurance and subaccount cost loadings.}}

The fees associated with a variable annuity include the following charges.
:*'''Mortality and expense risk charge''': This charge covers the insurer's costs for guaranteeing an annuity payout rate, as well as other insurance and administrative charges. This charge often contains the cost for providing a basic death benefit.The average basic death benefit costs between 0.15% and 0.35%&lt;ref name="lambert" /&gt;
:*'''Account maintenance fee''' This is usually a flat fee ($25-$35) assessed annually to the contract to cover the costs maintaining the account. The fee usually is waived at a certain account size level. The average VA asset based administrative and recordkeeping fee for 2008 was 0.25%.
:*'''Underlying subaccount fees''': Subaccounts have expense ratios just as do mutual funds. Average variable annuity subaccount [[Expense ratios | expense ratios]] are lower than average mutual fund expense ratios. Morningstar reports the 2011 average VA subaccount ER as 0.96%. 
:*'''Death benefit fees''':The cost for  enhanced death benefits ranges from .010% to 0.40%.&lt;ref name="lambert" /&gt;
:*'''Living benefit fees''':    
:** Guaranteed Minimum Income Benefit, average fee, 0.781%.
:** Guaranteed Minimum Accumulation Benefit, average fee, 0.76%.
:** Guaranteed Minimum Withdrawal, average fee, 0.836%.
:** Guaranteed Lifetime Withdrawal, average fee, 1.121%.&lt;ref&gt; Kevin Loffredi, [https://www.myirionline.org/eweb/uploads/Q3%202011%20Product%20Update%20Report.pdf Carriers Settle In: Variable Annuity Product Development Slows in Third Quarter], Morningstar &lt;/ref&gt;
:*'''Surrender charges''': Most variable annuities impose a surrender charge for withdrawals from or exchanges out of the contract. The percentage charge usually declines over time (usually 7 or 8 years) until it disappears. Some VAs impose a surrender charge on each investment you make in the contract. Many contracts allow you to withdraw a certain percentage of the account value (often 10%-15%) per year without incurring the surrender charge. .
:*'''Premium taxes''': Some states assess a regulatory tax on each variable annuity investment payment; other states assess a tax on accumulated annuity values which are annuitized and not taken as a lump sum.&lt;ref name="vanguard" /&gt;

==The income phase==
When it comes time to take income from a variable annuity you have three options:
:# You can make aperiodic withdrawals from the VA. With aperiodic withdrawals you retain control of the annuity's capital.
:# You can make [[Systematic withdrawal | systematic withdrawal]]s from the VA. A systematic withdrawal can be either a fixed percentage of the account balance, or a fixed regular withdrawal of a set dollar amount. With systematic withdrawals you retain control of the annuity's capital.
:# You can annuitize the VA. The decision to annuitize is irrevocable. With this option, you usually surrender control over the VA capital in return for an income stream. An annuitization can be either a [[Immediate fixed annuity |fixed immediate annuity]], or a [[Immediate variable annuity |variable immediate annuity]], or a combination of the two.

==Variable annuity taxation==
If a variable annuity is held within a qualified plan, the annuity is taxed according to the tax rules governing the qualified plan. Non-qualified variable annuities are subject to the following tax rules. All income is taxed at an individual's marginal income tax rate.

:*The VA, similar to other retirement vehicles, is subject to a 10% early withdrawal penalty for withdrawals made prior to age 59 and 1/2. Exceptions to the penalty include:
:** The owner is over age 59½;
:** The owner is disabled after contract purchase;
:** The owner, not the non-owner annuitant, dies;
:** Pre-TEFRA (prior to 8/14/82 contributions) nonqualified money;
:** Immediate nonqualified annuity (Note: An exchange from a deferred to an immediate annuity does not qualify as an immediate annuity for the purposes of avoiding tax penalty);
:** [[SEPP:Substantially Equal Periodic Payments|Substantially Equal Periodic Payments]].&lt;ref name="non-qualified"&gt;[http://www.immediateannuities.com/library_articles/taxation_of_nonqual_annuities.htm Non-Qualified Annuity Tax Rules]&lt;/ref&gt;

:* Non-qualified VAs are not subject to the required minimum distribution rules. This allows you to potentially continue to defer taxes past the 70 and 1/2 age required distribution date that applies to [[Traditional IRA|traditional IRAs]] and qualified plans (if you are not still working). Most VAs do have a point (frequently age 85) where you are required to annuitize the contract.

:* VA withdrawals are made on an earnings first, basis last principle. An exception applies to pre-TEFRA contributions to an annuity made prior to 8/14/82. Withdrawals from these contracts are on a basis first, earnings last principle.

:* VA ownership transfers such as:
:** Addition/deletion of joint owner;
:** Transfer to another individual or entity;   
:** Assignment;
:* Can have the following tax consequences:
:** Earnings are subject to income tax at time of transfer;
:** 10% penalty may apply;
:** Gift taxes may apply;
:* Exceptions to tax:
:** Transfers between spouses;
:** Transfers incident to divorce;
:** Transfers between an individual and their grantor trust;&lt;ref name="non-qualified" /&gt;

:* Upon annuitization each VA income payment represents a return of non-taxable investment in the contract with the balance of each payment considered taxable income. The taxable and non-taxable portions of the payments are determined by an exclusion ratio, determined for a variable annuity by dividing the investment in the contract by the total number of expected payments. Once the total amount of the investment in the contract is recovered, the annuity payments are fully taxable. If the owner dies before the total investment in the contract is recovered, and annuity payments cease as a result of his death, the un-recovered amount is allowed as a deduction to the owner on the final tax return.&lt;ref name="non-qualified" /&gt;

:*For variable annuity contracts issued on or after 10/29/79 there is no "step-up" in basis for income tax purposes and the beneficiary pays income tax on the earnings. If the annuity is subject to estate tax, the beneficiary is entitled to deduct a portion of estate tax paid on the annuity for income tax purposes. For variable annuity contracts issued prior to 10/21/79, there is a "step-up" in basis for income tax purposes and no income tax is payable on the earnings.&lt;ref name="non-qualified" /&gt;

==Distributions upon the death of the variable annuity owner==
A surviving non-spouse joint owner or beneficiary of a non-qualified VA must select one of the following distribution options for a VA inherited during the accumulation phase of the contract:
:* immediate lump sum;
:* according to the five-year rule with complete withdrawal(s) within 5 years of the contract owner's death;
:* annuitization (over the life of the new owner) to start within one year of the contract owner's death.

A spousal co-owner or beneficiary has the option of assuming the variable annuity as their own.&lt;ref name="non-qualified" /&gt;

The income over basis in a variable annuity is considered [[Income in respect of a decedent | income in respect of a decedent]]. This means that the increase in value inside a deferred variable annuity does not receive stepped up valuation upon the death of the contract owner. The beneficiary assumes both the decedent's basis in the annuity, as well as the same tax character of the income. Should a decedent's estate pay estate tax the portion of the tax attributable to the estate's IRD is deductible as a miscellaneous itemized deduction (not subject to the 2% AGI exclusion) to the beneficiary receiving the IRD. The deduction is figured by computing the estate tax due on the entire estate and computing the estate tax due on the estate minus all IRD. The difference between the two provides the deductible amount. The deduction is realized on the IRD as the IRD is paid out to the beneficiary.&lt;ref name="non-qualified" /&gt;

The beneficiary's right to income after the death of the annuitant during the annuitization  phase of a variable annuity will depend on the annuitization option selected (single life, joint life, or the selection of a guaranteed period).&lt;ref name="non-qualified" /&gt;

==The 1035 exchange==
The IRS allows you to make tax free transfers of annuities through what is known as a 1035 exchange. Since variable annuities are typically burdened with high insurance costs and stiff back end surrender fees, a tax-free exchange of high cost contracts to  no-load, no surrender fee, low cost annuities is clearly warranted for most non-qualifying annuities. Low cost VAs are offered by [http://personal.fidelity.com/products/annuities/?bar=c Fidelity] and [http://www.tiaa-cref.org/products/annuities/index.html TIAA-CREF].  The [http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec1035ex.asp 1035 transfer] decision can be quantified using a spreadsheet template similar to the one offered by Dr. Moshe Milevsky as an adjunct to his paper [http://www.ifid.ca/pdf_workingpapers/WP2003DEC19.pdf Exchanging Variable Annuities: An Optional Test for Suitability]. The annuity option variables to include in a calculation are (quoting Milevsky):

# '''Lapse value'''. This captures the cash-flow that comes from liquidating or surrendering the policy – possibly after paying a contingent deferred surrender charge (CDSC) – and is tied to the evolution of the market value of the sub-accounts. Most investors purchase VAs exclusively for their lapse value since they view the instrument as a (tax-preferred) savings vehicle. Therefore, when contemplating an exchange, the policy holder should be aware of the discounted lapse value (DLV) of the new policy. All else being equal, the greater the contingent deferred surrender charges (CDSC) on the new policy and/or the greater the Mortality and Expense Risk Fees (from here, abbreviated M&amp;E Fee) relative to the old policy, the lower the discounted lapse value, and the less likely it is that an exchange will add economic value to the investor.
# '''Death value'''. Most VA policies contain some form of guaranteed minimum death benefit. This guarantee comes in various shapes and flavors, but usually consists of a return-of-premium guarantee together with a minimally guaranteed interest rate and/or anniversary step-up feature, which periodically raises the minimum guarantee to market value. And, while these guaranteed minimum death benefits (GMDB)5 (as they are collectively known) have become a recent nuisance to the risk management and treasury departments within the insurance companies issuing these policies, the fact is that most consumers are more likely to lapse their VA than die and cash-in on the GMDB. Nevertheless, this embedded option must be priced in any transaction and we use the term discounted mortality value (DMV) to denote the current value of this guarantee.
# '''Guaranteed annuity rates'''. All variable annuity policies contain an option to annuitize – in the form of a guaranteed mortality table and interest rate -- which is poorly understood and usually ignored. Many older VAs contain annuity rate guarantees that are linked to outdated mortality tables and are thus more valuable, relative to updated mortality tables that assume a longer life expectancy. More recent VA policies offer optional guaranteed minimum income benefit (GMIB) riders which are a form of guaranteed annuity rate. In general, we use the term discounted annuity value (DAV) to denote the collection of options associated with the ability to annuitize the policy at a pre-specified mortality table and interest rate.

The spreadsheet program for quantifying the 1035 exchange can be downloaded [http://www.ifid.ca/annuities_exchanging.htm here]. [Please note that this spreadsheet is made available for educational purposes, not for commercial use.]

Inputs for the spreadsheet include:

* The client's age;
* The capital value of the Annuity. This allows you to account for any conditional surrender fees assessed upon transfer;
* The death benefit value. For a client's current contract, this value can be either "in the money" or "out of the money." An "in the money" death benefit would potentially apply to contract values after a bear market, where the insured death benefit could be greater than the current market value of the contract. A transfer would negate this insured value since the new contract would, assuming the election of a death benefit, insure only the current market value of the portfolio. In most cases, the death benefit will be "out of the money", meaning that, assuming the election of a death benefit, the new contract will provide for a higher insured value for the transferred portfolio. Vanguard offers their VA with a zero death benefit at reduced cost. The program does not allow a zero input, so you should either input a nominal value or an estimated maximum downside risk value for this zero death benefit input.
* The expense ratios of the two contracts;
* The assumed volatility of the two portfolios (standard deviation);
* The risk-free rate of return.

The output will provide the economic value of the proposed transfer. Positive values indicate that a transfer is economically suitable. Negative values indicate that a transfer is economically unsuitable.

An '''immediate variable annuity '''is a financial contract between you and an insurance company. You give the company money now and the company pays you an income at a later time.

Income annuities can be [[Immediate fixed annuity | fixed]] or variable. The payments from variable income annuities discussed here fluctuate and are based on the performance of the investment options you choose. Although payments may go up or down, [[Variable Annuity|variable annuities]] are designed to provide income that can rise over time to help you keep pace with inflation. Immediate annuities are often designated as Single Premium Immediate Annuities (SPIA) to differentiate them from deferred annuities.

==Annuity units==
Investments in an immediate variable annuity are placed in what is termed a Separate Account, which is an account segregated from an insurer's general account and is exempt from the insurer's creditors. Investors are provided with a menu of subaccounts, pooled investment vehicles analogous to mutual funds, offering access to stocks, bonds, and money market instruments. The annuity investor's capital will fluctuate with the returns of the underlying subaccount investments. The terminology used in connection with a subaccount, along with the analogous mutual fund terminology is provided in the following table:&lt;ref&gt;Vanguard Variable Annuity Prospectus, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;

The basic construct of an immediate variable annuity (SPIA) is the annuity unit. The unit is computed according to three factors applied to the specific chosen distribution option and life expectancy of the investor:

:# The monthly payment per $1,000 invested. Using an assumed interest rate (AIR) and mortality assumptions, an actuary can price the initial annuity payment.
:#The amount invested.
:#The accumulated unit value (AUV) of the underlying subaccount portfolio. 

As a simplfied example, assume that the actuary provides a $6.00 monthly payment per $1000 invested; an investor invests $50,000 in a balanced subaccount fund; and the AUV of the subaccount fund is $10.00. The following computation yields the number of annuity units.

(50 x 6.00)/10.00 = 30.00 annuity units. The initial monthly income from this subaaccount fund would, in this instance, equal 30.00 x 10.00= $300.00.&lt;ref&gt;Daily, Glenn, S. “The attractions and pitfalls of variable immediate annuities,” AAII Journal, (February 1994)&lt;/ref&gt; 

This is the key to the insurer's lifetime income guarantee. With a life annuity, the annuitant will be paid 30.00 annuity units for life. Gross fund performance minus fund and insurance expenses, and the AIR will determine the ensuing payments.

==Assumed interest rate (AIR)==
The AIR assumes two pivotal valuation functions for a variable SPIA. It determines the initial annuity income payment as well as the variable adjustments to income. The AIR usually ranges from 3% to 7%. Vanguard&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/866252/000119312509022610/d485apos.htm Vanguard VA Prospectus] p.10.&lt;/ref&gt; and TIAA-CREF&lt;ref&gt;[http://connect.rightprospectus.com/TIAA/TADF/194408803/P?site=VA CREF Annuities prospectus] p.101.&lt;/ref&gt; use a 4% AIR in their existing VA contracts.

The higher the initial AIR, the higher the initial payment. Later income appreciation will be slower with a high AIR, and income losses likelier. A lower AIR results in a smaller initial income, but produces faster income appreciation, thus providing better hedging against inflation risk, as well as smaller income losses during down markets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/820627/000119312508096683/d485bpos.txt Vanguard Lifetime Income prospectus] p.32.&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to note, however, that all AIR income streams are actuarially equivalent. In addition, because the AIR discount rate is applied to the more reliable expected mortality experience of a pooled cohort of annuitants, the initial income payout for an annuitization of a lump sum (for retirement age annuitants) is frequently higher than the income from an equal systematic withdrawal rate applied to the same lump sum. Below are the monthly income implications for both a 3.5% AIR and a 7% AIR, assuming 10% and -10 % returns:

::&lt;u&gt;3.5% AIR&lt;/u&gt;
*10 percent gain: (1.10/1.035-1)= 6.28%
*10 percent loss: (0.90/1.035-1)= -13.04%

::&lt;u&gt;7.0% AIR&lt;/u&gt;
*10 percent gain:(1.10/1.070-1)= 2.80%
*10 percent loss:(0.90/1.070-1)= -15.89%

==The exclusion ratio==
Variable immediate annuities receive a degree of tax relief (for non-qualified dollars) due to the income exclusion rules. The IRS allows the investment in the contract to be recovered over the annuitant's life expectancy. In our previous example of a $50,000 initial investment and a 20-year life expectancy, approximately $2500 of the annual income stream would be a tax-free return of principal for 20 years. After year 20, the full income payment will be taxed. If the owner dies before the total investment in the contract is recovered, and annuity payments cease as a result of his death, the un-recovered amount is allowed as a deduction to the owner on the final tax return.&lt;ref&gt;Babbel, David F., and Reddy, Ravi, [http://fic.wharton.upenn.edu/fic/Policy%20page/AnnuityTaxation1.pdf "Measuring the Tax Benefit of a Tax-Deferred Annuity"], Wharton Financial Institutions Center Policy Brief: Personal Finance, (October 4, 2008} &lt;/ref&gt; 

==Fundamental common benefits==
Almost all variable SPIAs allow the investor to choose an initial asset allocation for the portfolio. After annuitization, the investor loses control of the invested capital, but can still maintain control of the asset allocations of the underlying portfolio. This allows the investor to maintain control of the expected returns and risk parameters of the portfolio income stream. Many immediate variable SPIAs also allow the investor to reallocate annuity units into the insurer's general account and the [[Immediate fixed annuity |  fixed immediate annuity]] payout option.

Usually the investor is given flexibility in timing the investment stream (monthly, quarterly, annually) as well as the periodicity of the variable income adjustments (monthly vs. annually).

==Income options==
Common income options for immediate variable annuities include the following four optiions.

*'''Single life annuity''': As the annuitant, you receive regular income payments for your lifetime, ending at your death. (Payments are largest with this option.)
*'''Joint and survivor annuity''':Payments are made as long as you (the annuitant) or another person (the joint annuitant), such as your spouse, are living. Many annuities allow you to select a percentage (50%, 66.67%, 75% or 100%) of the amount that was payable while the annuitant was alive to go to the joint surviving annuitant.
*'''Single life with a guarantee''':As the annuitant, you receive payments as long as you live, but not less than a guaranteed period. If you die before the period ends, your beneficiaries receive the remaining payments. The guaranteed period may cover 5 to 50 years for nonqualified (after-tax) assets and up to your life expectancy for qualified (pre-tax) assets.
*'''Joint and survivor with a guarantee''':Payments are made as long as you (the annuitant) or another person (the joint annuitant) are living, but not less than a guaranteed period. If both you and the joint annuitant die before the period ends, your beneficiaries receive the remaining payments. The guaranteed period may cover 5 to 50 years for nonqualified (after-tax) assets and up to your life expectancy for qualified (pre-tax) assets.&lt;ref&gt;Merkel, Stephen,[http://www.investopedia.com/articles/retirement/05/071105.asp Selecting The Payout On Your Annuity] Investopedia&lt;/ref&gt;

The addition of a guarantee option will reduce the income payment from the annuity.

==Commutation and withdrawals of principal==
Many immediate variable annuities grant an annuitant who has selected a life annuity with a guarantee period the right to commute the annuity stream into a lump sum payment. Reflecting the reduced capital providing for the income stream, a commutation results in both a lower ensuing income and a shorter guarantee period.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.standard.com/annuities/eforms/13020.pdf Commutation on Life Income Payments] policy illustration&lt;/ref&gt;

If the variable SPIA offers a Guaranteed Minimum Withdrawal Benefit (at a higher cost) this optional benefit guarantees, regardless of market performance, that you will be able to receive at least the entire amount of your total principal investment through a series of annual withdrawals – provided that you do not withdraw more than a specified percentage of your total investment in any given year. Some variable annuities are now offering this benefit with the guarantee that you can make withdrawals for as long as you live.&lt;ref&gt;Devine, Colin, Hunt, Heather L.  and  Walsh, Keith, [http://www.peterkatt.com/newsletters/SmithBarney.pdf "The New Variable Annuity"] Smith Barney (September 14, 2004). p.21.&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''immediate fixed annuity''' represents a fixed sum of money paid to someone each year, typically for the rest of their life. Modern annuities are financial contracts between an individual and an insurance company. You give the company money now and the company pays you an income that starts almost immediately.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/immediatepaymentannuity.asp Immediate Payment Annuity] definition, investopedia. Reviewed 2 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

An immediate annuity is often designated as a '''Single Premium Immediate Annuity (SPIA)''' or an ''income'' annuity to differentiate it from a ''deferred'' annuity. Income annuities can be fixed or [[Immediate variable annuity|variable]]. The payments from fixed income annuities discussed here, unless they are graded, or inflation-indexed, will remain fixed over the distribution period. 

==Annuity basics==

Income annuities are designed to insure an individual against the risk of outliving an income stream during the withdrawal phase of the life cycle. The payout from the annuity will reflect the following factors.

===Insurance company pricing factors===

* '''Investment income'''. The level of interest income derived from the investments funding the annuity pool. This will generally reflect the interest rate level available at the time of purchase.
* '''Life expectancy'''. Insurer's use life expectancy tables for estimating mortality and pricing payouts. The tables insurers use reflect higher life expectancies than general population mortality tables by assuming life expectancies for healthy individuals with a continuing year by year improvement in mortality during the payout period.&lt;ref name= "Walsh"&gt; Walsh, Thomas A., "The (Mostly) Pros and (Few) Cons of Lifetime Payout Annuities" TIAA-CREF Institute, April 8, 2002. Available at (defunct link) or [http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.tiaa-crefinstitute.org/research/papers/docs/040802.pdf archive]&lt;/ref&gt; Life expectancy is lower for men than it is for women, and is higher for joint annuitants than it is for single annuitants.&lt;ref&gt;Ameriks, John, and Ren, Liquan, "Generating Guaranteed Income:Understanding Income Annuities" 2008. Available at https://personal.vanguard.com/pdf/icruia.pdf &lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:LifeTables.gif|frame|center|Figure 1. Life Expectancy at age 65 [http://www.ssa.gov/oact/NOTES/as120/LifeTables_Body.html Social Security]]]
* '''Mortality credits'''. The income annuity payout is comprised of both interest and principal. As members of the insurance pool die, their principal remains in the annuity pool to be used for paying longer lived annuitants.
* '''Expenses'''. While costs from fixed immediate annuities are not revealed, an annuity with lower costs will provide an annuitant with higher income.&lt;ref name= "Walsh"/&gt;

===Individual annuitant factors affecting income payouts===
* '''The age of the annuitant'''. The initial income payout will also be determined in part by the age of the individual(s) purchasing the annuity. Payouts are higher for older annuitants; lower for younger annuitants. Income payouts are higher for single annuitants than for joint annuitants. Income payments are higher for male annuitants (lower life expectancy) than for female annuitants (higher life expectancy).
* '''The income option chosen'''. While fixed immediate annuities are the most commonly chosen fixed payout option, graded options and inflation indexed options can also be chosen.&lt;ref&gt; TIAA-CREF examines retirement distribution choices of its investors in [http://www.tiaa-cref.org/institute/research/dialogue/rd_48.html Trends in the Selection of TIAA-CREF Life-Annuity Income Options,1978-1994] and [http://www.tiaa-cref.org/institute/research/dialogue/rd_74.html Recent Trends in the Selection of Retirement Income Streams Among TIAA-CREF Participants] &lt;/ref&gt; While the income stream from graded and inflation indexed income annuities offer increasing income payments over the life of the annuitant, the initial payment will be higher for a fixed payment: lower for a graded or inflation indexed payment.
* '''Adding a period certain'''. Payments for a straight single or straight joint annuitization end with the death of the annuitant(s). Individuals can guarantee payments for a set period for an added cost. For example, adding a 20 year guarantee period certain option to a straight life annuity at age 65 (assuming a 6% annuity pool return) would reduce the initial payment by an estimated 9% for a single life annuity and an estimated 2% reduction for a joint annuitization.&lt;ref name= "Walsh"/&gt;

==Fixed income options==
It is important to understand that the payment streams from an income annuity consist of both income and principal, so the payout percentages are not comparable to the yields of fixed income securities or dividend yields from stocks. The payout is comparable to the percentage withdrawal rates of a systemic withdrawal. You can determine the actual yield of the annuity payout by using the google spreadsheet included in the external links below. The yield of the income annuity investment will increase as the term of payout increases.

In the U.S., annuitization of retirement assets is quite low. According to 2010 TIAA-CREF surveys, only 11% of U.S. citizens had annuitized nest eggs.&lt;ref&gt; Yaboski, Paul A.,"Retirement Confidence on Campus: The 2010 Higher Education Retirement Confidence Survey". Available at http://www.tiaa-crefinstitute.org/institute/research/trends_issues/ti_confidencesurvey0610.html &lt;/ref&gt; Among college and university employees investing in TIAA-CREF retirement plans, some 34% planned on annuitizing or partially annuitizing their contributory retirement plan accumulations at retirement.&lt;ref&gt; Yaboski, Paul A.,"Retirement Confidence on Campus: The 2011 Higher Education Retirement Confidence Survey". Available at http://www.tiaa-crefinstitute.org/institute/research/trends_issues/ti_higheredRCS0611.html &lt;/ref&gt;

Inflation risk should be a major consideration when evaluating a [[#Fixed payment method|fixed annuity income option]], since inflation will reduce the purchasing power of a fixed income stream over time. Figure 2 shows the eroding purchasing power effect of a 3% inflation rate over time. If you are thinking of using a fixed annuity payout to cover two to four decades of retirement income, you should consider using [[#Inflation indexed|inflation indexed income annuities]] or a [[#Graded payment option|graded income annuity]] with a higher (3% or 4%) annual income adjustment.

[[File:DollarInflationAdjusted.png|frame|center|450px|Figure 2.[(defunct link) Bob's Financial Website]]]

===Fixed payment method===
[[File:Annuity income.jpg|thumb|right|550px|Figure 3. [http://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=1305410#p1305410 Re: Rates on Annuities]]] 
In the U.S. fixed payment income annuities have existed since 1759, although the market was quite small until the Great Depression.&lt;ref&gt; Poterba, James, "The History of Annuities in the United States". Available at http://www.annuity-insurers.org/Resources/History/History-of-annuities.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; TIAA introduced fixed annuities in 1918.&lt;ref&gt; Ameriks, John, "Recent Trends in the Selection of Retirement Income Streams Among TIAA-CREF Participants," Research Dialogue, December 2002 | Issue #74. Available at http://www.tiaa-cref.org/institute/research/dialogue/rd_74.html&lt;/ref&gt; According to research from TIAA-CREF, the fixed payment option is the most frequently chosen life annuity option chosen by the firm's retirement plan owners.

Since a fixed payment annuity does not provide for an escalating future income stream, its initial income payout will be higher than a similar graded payment or inflation indexed payment. The necessary tradeoff for the higher initial payment is that the income stream will be eroded by inflation over time. This lack of inflation hedging should be a major concern for younger annuitants, since long expected payouts can be seriously eroded by inflation The lack of inflation hedging may not be as much an issue for investors making an annuitization late in the life cycle (circa age 80) with shorter life expectancies. For these annuitants, inflation is expected to have less time to compound, and there would be less time for a rising graded or inflation index payment stream to match or exceed the higher fixed income payment.

Figure 3 shows the fluctuation of fixed income annuity rates from 1987 to 2009. The data tracks income annuity payout rates for both 65 year old males and 65 year old females in comparison to interest rates on corporate and treasury bonds. While the direction of payout rates tends to track interest rates it is important to note that SPIA payouts rise and fall less, proportionately, because SPIA pricing is based in part on mortality which is unaffected by interest rates. Thus even when the interest rate is low it can be advantageous to go ahead with an SPIA purchase, because the lowness of interest rate hurts investment opportunity for money held out of SPIA more than it hurts payments received from the SPIA.

===Graded payment method===

With a graded payment method, an annuitant receives an initial annual income payment which is subsequently increased by either a preselected set amount, or by an amount above a targeted investment rate. Graded payment methods for fixed income annuity payouts were introduced by TIAA-CREF in 1982.&lt;ref&gt; King, Francis P., "The TIAA Graded Payment Method and the CPI" (December 1995). TIAA-CREF Research Dialogues, Issue No. 45. Available at http://www.tiaa-crefinstitute.org/ucm/groups/content/@ap_ucm_p_tcp_docs/documents/document/tiaa02029429.pdf] &lt;/ref&gt; TIAA bases the initial income on a 4% payout rate. TIAA reinvests excess earnings to buy additional future income. Increases to the annuity income occur as long as the TIAA total total interest return exceeds 4%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tiaa-cref.org/ucm/groups/content/@ap_ucm_p_tcp/documents/document/tiaa04016217.pdf Adjusting Your Annuity Income], TIAA-CREF &lt;/ref&gt;

Graded payment methods allow for an income stream that will increase over time. As long as the increases match or exceed the inflation rate the annuitant will have achieved some protection of purchasing power.

===Inflation indexed===
[[File:Inflation-adjusted annuity.jpg|thumb|right|550px|Figure 4.[http://wpfau.blogspot.com/2012/02/are-annuities-spias-okay-when-interest.html Pensions, Retirement Planning, and Economics Blog]]] 
For U.S. investors, the payout from an inflation indexed SPIA will provide an income that will match the CPI-U inflation rate, thus offering a hedge against inflation which a fixed income annuity can not provide. Inflation indexed income annuities have been in existence for a longer time, and are more prevalent, in the U.K. 

As table 4. indicates, the initial payout from an inflation indexed annuity will track the level of real interest rates at the time of purchase.

Inflation indexed annuities are priced to produce lower initial levels of income than those provided by fixed income annuities. According to research provided by Schirripa (2009),&lt;ref&gt; Schirripa, Felix, "Immediate Annuity Fixed vs. Inflation-Protected: A Cost Comparison" Elm Income Group, (April 2009). Available at [http://www.ebri.org/pdf/programs/policyforums/CPI_Fixed_Annuities_Value.pdf] &lt;/ref&gt; this reduction results in a 26% lower initial income for a 65 year old male, and a 28% reduction for a 65 year old female (the reductions are somewhat higher at age 60; somewhat lower at age 70). The point at which the lower inflation indexed initial payment will match and exceed the nominal fixed payment will depend on the ensuing inflation rate. At a 4% inflation rate, the inflection point is approximately 8 years; at a lower 2% inflation, the inflection point is much later, circa 17 years.

Huang and Milevsky&lt;ref&gt;Huang, Huaxiong and Milevsky, Moshe, "Should Retirees Hedge Against Inflation, or Just Worry About It?", Journal of Pension Economics and Finance, July 2011. Available at [http://www.yorku.ca/milevsky/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/HM2011_JPEF.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; point to an additional consideration about inflation indexed income annuities. Retiree costs tend to track the health care and housing cost components of the CPI-U. These costs often rise faster than the CPI-U, so the annuity income stream may not offset an individual's personal inflation rate. As a possible means of offsetting higher inflation, Milevsky and Chen (2003)&lt;ref&gt; Chen, Peng, and [[Milevsky, Moshe| Milevski, Moshe A,]],"Merging Asset Allocation and Longevity Insurance: An Optimal Perspective on Payout Annuities" ''Journal of Financial Planning''/June 2003. Available at [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228798083_Merging_asset_allocation_and_longevity_insurance_An_optimal_perspective_on_payout_annuities ResearchGate]&lt;/ref&gt; and Walsh (2002)&lt;ref&gt;Walsh, Thomas A., "Annuities and Inflation" TIAA-CREF Institute, (April 9, 2002). Available at (defunct link)&lt;/ref&gt; advise adding an allocation of a low-cost, [[Immediate Variable Annuity - SPIA |immediate variable annuity]] to an individual's product allocation plan.

==Annuitization options==
In addition to the first four common annuitization options available to an immediate variable annuitization, immediate fixed annuities offer a large number of additional options:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.incomesolutions.com/ISAnnuityTypes.aspx Immediate Annuity Types], Income Solutions&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Single life only'''. As the annuitant, you receive regular income payments for your lifetime, ending at your death. (Payments are largest with this option.)
* '''Single life with a guaranteed number of years'''. As the annuitant, you receive payments as long as you live, but not less than a guaranteed period. If you die before the period ends, your beneficiaries receive the remaining payments. The guaranteed period covers 5 to 50 years for nonqualified (after-tax) assets and up to your life expectancy for qualified (pre-tax) assets.
* '''Joint and survivor life only'''. Payments are made as long as you (the annuitant) or another person (the joint annuitant), such as your spouse, are living. Often you can choose the amount of the remaining annuity payments as a percentage (50%, 66.67%, 75% or 100%) of the amount that was payable while the annuitant was alive.
* '''Joint and survivor with a guaranteed number of years'''. Payments are made as long as you (the annuitant) or another person (the joint annuitant) are living, but not less than a guaranteed period. If both you and the joint annuitant die before the period ends, your beneficiaries receive the remaining payments. The guaranteed period covers 5 to 50 years for nonqualified (after-tax) assets and up to your life expectancy for qualified (pre-tax) assets.
* '''Single life with installment refund'''. As the annuitant, you receive fixed payments for your lifetime. If you die and the sum of the income payments you’ve received is less than your purchase premium, your beneficiaries will receive the difference through monthly payments. 
* '''Single life with full cash refund'''. As the annuitant,you receive fixed payments for your lifetime. If you die and the sum of the income payments you've received is less than your purchase premium, your beneficiaries receive a lump-sum refund of the difference. 
* '''Joint &amp; survivor with installment refund'''. Payments are made as long as you (the annuitant) or another person (the joint annuitant) are living. If both you and the joint annuitant die and the sum of the income payments you’ve received is less than your purchase premium, your beneficiaries will receive the difference through monthly payments. 
* '''Joint &amp; survivor with full cash refund'''. Payments are made as long as you (the annuitant) or another person (the joint annuitant) are living. If both you and the joint annuitant die and the sum of the income payments you’ve received is less than your purchase premium, your beneficiaries receive a lump-sum refund of the difference. 
* '''Guaranteed number of years only'''. As the annuitant, you receive fixed payments for a guaranteed number of years (5 to 50 years for nonqualified (after-tax) assets and up to your life expectancy for qualified (pre-tax) assets). If you die before this period ends, your beneficiaries receive the remaining payments. Payments end when the guaranteed period ends, whether or not you or your beneficiaries are still living.

==Exclusion ratio==
Fixed immediate annuities receive a degree of tax relief (for non-qualified dollars) due to the income exclusion rules. The IRS allows the investment in the contract to be recovered over the annuitant's life expectancy. The calculation of the Exclusion Ratio is made according to the General Rule (found in [http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p939.pdf IRS Publication 939 General Rule for Pensions and Annuities]. The annuity payments will be partially taxable due to the exclusion over the recipient's life expectancy. After this term. the full income payment will be taxed. If the owner dies before the total investment in the contract is recovered, and annuity payments cease as a result of his death, the un-recovered amount is allowed as a deduction to the owner on the final tax return.

==Credit ratings and State Guarantee Funds==
The income from an immediate fixed annuity is derived from an insurance company's general account and is subject to the creditworthiness of the insurer. To lessen the risk of default you should purchase immediate fixed annuities from insurer's gaining the highest credit worthiness ratings from the five insurance rating firms.

* A.M. Best
* Fitch Ratings
* Standard &amp; Poor's
* Moody's
* Weiss Ratings

In case of insurer default, your State Guarantee Fund will attempt to find a replacement insurer for your contract, and will offer insurance on a given amount of annuity investment (usually up to $100,000, but greater in some states). Keep in mind that the State Guarantee Funds are not obligations of the federal or state governments but are funded by assessments placed on insurance companies that sell policies in your state. The following links provide information on state guarantee limits, as well as what happens as a consequence of an insurance company failure.

==Pros and cons==
The question of whether or not to annuitize a nest egg will depend on individual circumstances. The following factors will help show under what circumstances an annuitization will be more or less suitable or unsuitable.

* '''Irrevocable'''. The decision to convert a lump sum into an income annuity is an irrevocable decision. You lose the flexibility of managing the lump sum in exchange for a series of payments over time. For many investors this irrevocable loss of control is a profound negative.
* '''Default risk'''. While an income annuity offers a guarantee of a lifelong income stream, that guarantee is contingent on the insurance company remaining solvent over the investor's lifetime. Default rates for insurance companies have historically been low,&lt;ref&gt;Peter G. Gallanis, [http://www.nolhga.com/resource/file/NOLHGAandFinancialCrisis.pdf NOLHGA, the Life and Health Insurance Guaranty System, and the Financial Crisis of 2008–2009]. 74 insurance companies were liquidated by the NOLHGA from 1987-2009&lt;/ref&gt; but defaults are not impossible. Default risk can be reduced by dividing income annuities among several highly rated insurers, and by keeping income annuity payouts from a given insurer below the NOLHGA insurance limits offered by your state.
* '''Health'''. A primary advantage of an income annuity is that it is designed to pay an income for life. Obviously, your health is a major determinant in your life expectancy. So if you enter the retirement cycle in good health and has a family history of long life, an income annuity is a suitable option to consider. Even if you are not in perfect health an income annuity may be suitable since many companies offer medical underwriting rates for such annuitants. For the terminally ill an income annuity is unsuitable.
** '''Hedging later life capacity impairments'''. In addition to your health at the beginning of retirement, you need to consider the possibility of cognitive impairment should you live a long life. An income annuity provides an ongoing income stream that remains intact should you become mentally incapacitated later in life when making financial decisions is no longer possible.
* '''Wealth accumulation'''. The suitability of adding an income annuity to the investment product mix is also highly dependent of your wealth accumulation. For the large segments of American society who enter the retirement period with no, or very limited financial assets, an income annuity offers no solution. On the other end of the wealth distribution, for those having very large financial assets allowing them to self insure a retirement income, income annuities are not usually needed. For the large segment of the population in the middle ranges of the wealth distribution spectrum, income annuities are suitable for consideration. A number of additional wealth factors can influence the decision of whether or not to annuitize.
** '''Existing annuities'''. Traditionally, retirement income security was based on what was called a "tripod stool" which consisted of three legs: social security; a lifetime income stream from a defined benefit pension; and personal savings. With defined benefit pension plans no longer offered to a large segment of imminent and future retirees, these individuals will have only social security and personal savings as funding mechanisms for retirement income. For these individuals adding an income annuity to the retirement product allocation is a suitable option to consider. For individuals who enter retirement with living expenses sufficiently covered with lifetime income from a defined benefit pension and social security, adding an income annuity is often not needed.
** '''Legacy bequests'''. The desire to provide an inheritance to family or charitable interests varies with individual preference. Once again there is a spectrum between having no desire to leave an inheritance and a maximum desire to provide a legacy. The lower the concern for providing a legacy, the more suitable an income annuity becomes. However, individuals who do place a value on providing a legacy should consider the following points.
**# You can assure that the funds you annuitize will be paid out by adding to the income annuity a guarantee period roughly matching your life expectancy. This option will, however reduce the income you receive from the annuity. 
**# Ameriks and Ren (2008)&lt;ref name= "Ameriks"&gt;Ameriks, John, and Ren, Liquan, "Generating Guaranteed Income:Understanding Income Annuities" 2008. Available at [https://personal.vanguard.com/pdf/icruia.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; point out that although an early death soon after a partial annuitization will leave beneficiaries with less of an inheritance, the situation changes as a lifetime lengthens. They find that the life annuity tends to stabilize the inheritance values left to beneficiaries. For example, for [males] establishing an income annuity at age 65, the "bequest" breakeven point occurs between 80 and 85 years of age, essentially at the point of the individual's life expectancy at 65.
**# If a charitable interest is paramount, you should consider using a [[Charitable gift annuity| charitable gift annuity]] or [[Charitable remainder trust| charitable remainder trust]] as means for providing lifetime income streams. 
** '''Sequence of returns hedging'''. Income annuity can protect against poor returns occurring in the early phase of retirement.
** '''When to annuitize'''. At retirement or deferred.
** '''Partial annuitization'''. Very suitable.
* '''Taxes'''. An income annuity distributing income from a pre-tax contributory plan, such as a 401(k), 403(b), or traditional IRA will, aside from the differentiation in withdrawal schedules, bear similar tax burdens, since withdrawals from these plans are taxed at marginal rates. For high income retirees, a non-qualifed income annuity (funded with after-tax dollars) can be tax inefficient since once the invested capital is paid back, the full income stream from the income annuity becomes taxable at marginal tax rates.&lt;ref name="Ameriks"/&gt;

A '''fixed annuity''' is an insurance contract that pays a fixed rate of interest for a "set term", usually ranging from one to ten years. After the set term, a new fixed rate is offered for the next term. One popular form of a fixed annuity is a "multi-year guaranteed annuity", or "MYGA", also referred to as a "CD annuity".

A fixed annuity has two main phases, the accumulation phase in which you invest money into the annuity, and the income phase in which the annuity may be converted into income and payments are received. Earnings within the contract are tax deferred, and are taxed upon withdrawal at income tax rates (similar to qualified retirement plans) and share with these plans the 10% early penalty tax for withdrawals made prior to age 59 and 1/2.

If the annuity is held within a retirement plan it is known as a "qualified" annuity.  As with any other qualified plan, distributions from a qualified annuity are totally taxable.  However, exchanges to another qualified annuity, or transfers to another qualified account (such as an IRA) may be made without generating current taxable income.

If the annuity is purchased in the taxable account it is known as a "non-qualified"  annuity and only the earnings are subject to tax. There are no minimum distribution requirements if the annuity is non-qualified. Withdrawals are taxed on an income first, basis last principle.  A policyholder may defer the income tax on a withdrawal by executing a "1035 exchange" to another non-qualified annuity contract, either with the same insurance company or a different one.

The investment in a fixed annuity is backed by an insurance company's general account and is thus dependent on the claims paying solvency of the insurer. A fixed annuity is not considered an investment security, so it is not regulated by the SEC and there is no prospectus for the contract.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sec.gov/answers/annuity.htm SEC Annuities]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Surrender and market value adjustment fees==
A fixed deferred annuity does not have an [[Expense ratios |expense ratio]]. The expenses of administering and distributing the contract (including sales commissions to agents who sell annuities) are reflected in the interest rate offered to annuity buyers. 

Almost all fixed annuities have an additional surrender charge on distributions made before the set term ends. These charges usually decline gradually over the term of contract, reaching 0% when the set term expires. Renewing a contract by rolling it over to a new set term resets the surrender fee over the succeeding term. In addition, many fixed annuities have a market value adjustment (MVA) feature, which acts to adjust the surrender value for withdrawals before the set term expires. In general, the MVA will reduce the surrender value if interest rates have risen between the time of purchase and the time of surrender, and decrease the surrender value if interest rates have declined. 

Most fixed annuities have a free partial withdrawal privilege, usually either interest earnings or 10% of the account balance per year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/varannty.htm#vch SEC Surrender Charges]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bonus interest rate==
Some fixed deferred annuities, in a marketing ploy, offer enhanced "bonus" interest rates during the first year of an annuity's term. Invariably, the interest rate drops, sometimes considerably, over the remainder of the set term.

==The income phase==
When it comes time for you to take income from your annuity, you have the choice of making periodic or lump sum withdrawals from your annuity or opting to annuitize the contract.
===Withdrawals===
You can usually draw a partial withdrawal, without the imposition of a surrender fee, during a fixed annuity's set term, and a full withdrawal when the set term ends. Withdrawals are on an income first, principal last basis. Withdrawals made prior to age 59 and 1/2 are subject to the 10% federal early withdrawal penalty tax on interest earned.

===Annuitization===
Fixed deferred annuities may offer a number of income options (fixed, graded, and inflation adjusted) as well as a wide assortment of annuity payout options. See [[Immediate Fixed Annuity - SPIA]] for details on income options and tax considerations.

==Distributions upon the death of the owner==
A surviving non-spouse joint owner or beneficiary of a non-qualified fixed annuity must select one of the following distribution options for a fixed annuity inherited during the accumulation phase of the contract:
:* immediate lump sum;
:* according to the five-year rule with complete withdrawal(s) within 5 years of the contract owner's death;
:* annuitization (over the life of the new owner) to start within one year of the contract owner's death.

A spousal co-owner or beneficiary has the option of assuming the fixed annuity as their own.

Some annuities pay out the full accumulated value upon the death of the annuitant, while others pay out the surrender value.  If an annuity pays out the surrender value upon death, the insurance company may offer a rider (for an additional fee) that waives the surrender charge at death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.immediateannuities.com/library_articles/taxation_of_nonqual_annuities.htm Non-Qualified Annuity Tax Rules]&lt;/ref&gt;

The income over basis in a fixed annuity is considered [[Income in respect of a decedent | income in respect of a decedent]] (IRD). This means that the increase in value inside a deferred fixed annuity does not receive stepped up valuation upon the death of the contract owner. The beneficiary assumes both the decedent's basis in the annuity, as well as the same tax character of the income. Should a decedent's estate pay estate tax, the portion of the tax attributable to the estate's IRD is deductible as a miscellaneous itemized deduction (not subject to the 2% AGI exclusion) to the beneficiary receiving the IRD. The deduction is figured by computing the estate tax due on the entire estate and then computing the estate tax due on the estate minus all IRD. The difference between the two provides the deductible amount. The deduction is realized on the IRD as the IRD is paid out to the beneficiary.

The beneficiary's right to income after the death of the annuitant during the annuitization phase of a fixed annuity will depend on the annuitization option selected (single life, joint life, fixed term, or the selection of a guaranteed period or refund option).

==Credit ratings and State Guaranty Funds==
The return of principal and interest from a fixed annuity is subject to the creditworthiness of the insurer. You should consider the credit rating of the insurance company when purchasing a deferred fixed annuity.  The five insurance rating firms are:

:* A.M. Best
:* Fitch Ratings
:* Standard &amp; Poor's
:* Moody's
:* Weiss Ratings

In case of insurer default, your State Guaranty Fund will attempt to either find a replacement insurer for your contract, or will offer insurance on a given amount of annuity investment.  State guaranty fund limits vary.  The following links provide information on state guaranty limits, as well as what happens as a consequence of an insurance company failure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nolhga.com/policyholderinfo/main.cfm/location/insolvencyprocess What Happens When an Insurance Company Fails?]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''charitable gift annuity''' is an instrument designed to allow an individual to make a gift to a favorite charity and still receive an income from the gifted capital. An individual irrevocably transfers cash or property to a charitable organization in exchange for the charity's promise to make fixed annuity payments to one or a maximum two life annuitants. Unlike other [[Split-interest gifts|split-interest]] gifting vehicles, which are funded from an individual trust or pooled segregated fund, a gift annuity is considered a general obligation of the issuing charity. Many states require issuing organizations to be licensed and to maintain investment reserves. There are currently more than 4000 charitable organizations offering charitable gift annuities.  Most charities use payout rates established by the American Council of Gift Annuities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acga-web.org/ the American Council of Gift Annuities]&lt;/ref&gt;

The average age of the income beneficiary receiving payments is 78 years of age. A donor can contribute cash or appreciated assets for an immediate gift annuity payment, or make contributions for a deferred payment at a future date. The annuitant is often the donor, but this does not necessarily have to be the case. A donor may establish an immediate gift annuity for an aged parent, or a grandparent may establish a deferred gift annuity for a young child. Payout rates are lower for younger beneficiaries; higher for older beneficiaries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acga-web.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=51&amp;Itemid=197 Gift Annuity Best Practices]&lt;/ref&gt;  A 2004 ACGA survey found that the average size of a gift annuity contribution was $59,926. The median contribution was $28,027.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.tiaa-crefinstitute.org/institute/research/trends_issues/ti_giftannuities_1005.html The Role of Gift Annuities In a Planned Giving Program], Frank Minton, TIAA-CREF Institute, p.10 &lt;/ref&gt;

==How income payouts are determined==
The income streams from a charitable gift annuity are determined by the size of the donation, the number of income beneficiaries and their ages, the choice of payout option, and the payout rate, as established by the ACGA Suggested Charitable Gift Annuity Rate.

;Gift annuities offer the following payout options:
*Single Life
*Joint Life
*Successive

;The latest ACGA Suggested Charitable Gift Annuity Rate is computed by the following input factors:
*The residuum realized by the charity upon termination of an annuity is 50 percent.  (That is, if you give $100K, the charity expects to have $50K left upon your death based on the assumptions below.)
*Life expectancies are based on the 2012 Individual Annuity Reserving Table averaging male and female lives.
*Annual expenses for investment and administration are one percent of the fair market value of gift annuity reserves.
*The total annual return on gift annuity reserves,periodically adjusted by the ACGA, and available at their [http://www.acga-web.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;layout=blog&amp;id=27&amp;Itemid=205 website]. This projection is based on an asset allocation plan consisting of 40% equities, 55% fixed income, and 5% cash.
*The rates for the youngest and oldest ages are somewhat lower than the rates that would follow from the first four assumptions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acga-web.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=177:charitable-gift-annuity-rates-effective-january-1-2012&amp;catid=69&amp;Itemid=133#assumptions Underlying the Suggested ACGA Gift Annuity Rates]&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2004 ACGA survey found that the median actual residuum realized by charities from contributions was 65.6 percent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tiaa-crefinstitute.org/institute/research/trends_issues/ti_giftannuities_1005.html The Role of Gift Annuities In a Planned Giving Program], Frank Minton, TIAA-CREF Institute, p.8 &lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of gift annuities==
Gift Annuities are offered in both Immediate and Deferred Payout contracts.

;Immediate Gift Annuity
With an Immediate Gift Annuity one donates cash or appreciated assets to a charity in return for an immediate lifetime income stream of payments. These payments can be on a monthly, quarterly, semi-annual, or annual basis. The most common payment period is quarterly payments. The payment occurs on the last day of the period. The initial payment is usually prorated.
;Deferred Gift Annuity
A Deferred Gift Annuity allows a donor to contribute to a chosen charity and select a future payment date (at least one year from the contribution date). As with an Immediate Gift Annuity,  income payments can be received on a monthly, quarterly, semi-annual, or annual basis. Quarterly payments are the most common payment period.
;Tuition (College) Annuity
This Gift Annuity is a Deferred Gift Annuity established by a parent or grandparent for a young child, with the payment date deferred to the child's eighteenth birthday. The child can then elect lifetime payments, or more commonly, take a commuted value over four or five years. This type of Gift Annuity is not allowed by the state of New York.
;Flexible (Deferred Payment) Gift Annuity
With a Flexible Gift Annuity, an annuitant does not have to select a set future start date for receiving payments, but rather selects an initial target date for initiating payments, usually at retirement. The charity will supply a range of payment rates surrounding the target date. Payout rates are linked to age, so later life payout rates are higher than earlier ones.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acga-web.org/giftrates.html ACGA Suggested Charitable Gift Annuity Rates]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tax attributes==
Individuals who donate to a gift annuity can claim a charitable deduction for the gift, reduced by the present value of the expected income payments (as determined by IRS life expectancy tables and an [http://www.pgdc.com/pgdc/resources/tables/charitable-federal-midterm-rate-archive IRS supplied discount rate]). The IRS also imposes limitations on charitable deductions. If the donation is made with cash, the percentage limitation is 60% of adjusted gross income (AGI). If long-term appreciated property is transferred, the percentage limitation is 30% of AGI. Any deduction over the applicable percentage limitation may be carried forward and taken during the five following tax years. A Donor also has the option of taking a "special election" and use the appreciated asset's basis, and not its fair market value, for valuing the donation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sharpenet.com/gt/pdfs/2008/sept08.pdf Draw, Hold, or Call?], ''Give and Take'', Sept, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Taxation of income payments will depend on how the donation is funded.

;Cash Donations
If the gift annuity is funded with cash, part of the payments will be taxed as ordinary income and part will be tax-free.
;Appreciated Asset Donations
If funded with appreciated securities or real estate owned more than one year, and the donor is receiving the annuity payments, part of the payments will be taxed as ordinary income, part as capital gain, and part may be tax-free. If you as donor establish a gift annuity for someone other than yourself or your spouse, realize that unless you insert a clause in the contract reserving the right to abrogate the annuitant's right to income, you will be subject to the gift tax. This clause allows you to apply the annual gift tax exclusion to the yearly value of income distributions to the beneficiary annuitant.  If your donation is appreciated property you will also be obligated to pay the capital gains tax on a donation, adjusted for the present value of the income interest. The charitable deduction should be sufficient to cover most of the capital gains tax.  
;Retirement Plan Donations
If the gift annuity is the beneficiary of a Retirement Plan (IRA) the income payments are taxable to the annuity beneficiary. The estate receives a charitable deduction for the contribution, adjusted for the present value of the payments that the beneficiary will receive (according to IRS life expectancy tables.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pgdc.com/pgdc/charitable-gift-annuity Charitable Gift Annuity] Frank Minton, Planned Giving Design Center, LLC › PGDC Library&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sample quotes===
Many charities will provide on-line calculators that will provide the income and tax output for a given immediate or deferred donation.

====Single life immediate gift annuity====
The following sample quote, for a '''single life immediate gift annuity''' consisting of a gift of appreciated stock market assets, illustrates the tax attributes of the gift. ''Actual results will, of course, vary as payment rates and IRS discount rates change. Changes can also occur if mortality life expectancies change.''

==How charities invest charitable gift annuity donations==
The income payments a gift annuity annuitant receives are an obligation of the charity. The charity must therefore soundly invest the donated funds in order to meet its obligations to donor annuitants, as well as successfully maintain the 50% residual charity donation. Any failure to meet these funding requirements can force the charity to tap its general fund to make up shortfalls, or under the worst scenario, default on its promised payouts.

A charity assumes the following risks in offering gift annuities:
*'''Rate risk''': The charity may offer overly generous payout rates;
*'''Mortality risk''': The charity's gift annuity cohort of annuitants might live longer than expected life expectancy;
*'''Investment risk''': The investment markets may not provide sufficient returns to fund the gift annuity's obligations. Diversification of asset allocations will reduce that risk, but appropriate asset allocation at any given time depends on a judgment about market conditions and risk tolerance.&lt;ref name="pgdc"&gt;[http://www.pgdc.com/pgdc/article/2004/06/maximizing-benefits-your-gift-annuity-program  Maximizing the Benefits from Your Gift Annuity Program], Frank Minton, Planned Giving Design Center, LLC › PGDC Library&lt;/ref&gt; 
*'''Asset risk''': A charitable gift annuity must sell the appreciated assets a donor gifts to the charity. The asset may fall in price before the charity can sell it.
*'''Policy risk''': The charity's selection of minimum age and minimum donations for accepting gifts can affect the risk profile of the gift annuity investment pool.&lt;ref name="pgdc" /&gt;

The risks can be offset to some degree by adopting prudent management and investment policies, and through prudent use of "reinsurance", the purchase of commercial immediate annuities to partially transfer mortality risk to an insurer. All purchased annuities belong to the charity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sharpenet.com/gt/issues/2006/aug06/1.shtml Reinsurance of Gift Annuities - A Primer] Robert F. Sharpe, Jr.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pgdc.com/pgdc/article/2006/03/charitable-gift-annuity-reinsurance-top-ten-frequently-asked-questions Charitable Gift Annuity Reinsurance: The Top Ten Frequently Asked Questions] Bryan K. Clontz, Planned Giving Design Center, LLC › PGDC Library&lt;/ref&gt;

==How gift annuities compare to immediate annuities==
The 50% charitable residual in a gift annuity means that a charitable gift annuity's payout rate will be lower than the payout rate of a concurrent commercial insurance immediate annuity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sharpenet.com/gt/issues/2006/june06/1.shtml Understanding the "Gift" in "Annuities] Robert F. Sharpe, Jr., ''Give and Take'', June, 2006. 
&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
The primary motivation for using a charitable gift annuity is therefore the charitable intent.

==Considerations==
Keep in mind the following considerations when weighing the use of a gift annuity:

*A donation to a Charitable Gift Annuity is irrevocable, so you should definitely wish to be a benefactor to your chosen charity. Like all irrevocable decisions, you should be sure that you have no need for any lump sum you are considering donating. The charitable impulse should be the primary driver of your decision to donate.

*The payout on a Gift Annuity is fixed and is thus exposed to inflation risk. This factor (combined with the higher payouts available at advanced ages) might explain why the average age of a Gift Annuity income recipient is 78 years old. Inflation risk is not as critical a factor for an older annuitant as it is for a younger annuitant.

*A Gift Annuity is an obligation of the charity and is exposed to default risk. It is probably prudent to consider a gift annuity a supplement to one’s retirement income as opposed to being a major income source.

* Keep in mind the tax consequences of the gift--including the limitations (60% of AGI on cash gifts and 30% of AGI on appreciated asset gifts) and five year carryforward-- on taking a charitable deduction.  Be especially aware to the tax consequences of establishing a gift annuity for someone other than yourself or your spouse.

*Deferred Gift Annuities represent a small portion of the market (about 5%) mostly attributable to the inflexibility of the selected payout date. If you are making deferred contributions consider using a Flexible Deferred Gift Annuity to eliminate this rigidity.

*If your gift is large, or if you want an income that is not fixed but can grow with the returns of an investment portfolio, you should consider other split-interest charitable vehicles,such as establishing a [[Charitable remainder  trust| charitable remainder trust]], or making donations to a [[Charitable pooled income fund|charitable pooled income fund]].

An '''{{PAGENAME}}''' (EIA), also known as a '''Fixed Indexed Annuity''' (FIA), or '''Indexed Annuity''' is a [[Fixed Annuity | fixed annuity]] whose interest is based, in part, on the performance of a securities ''index'' (equity, commodity, or bond). The most common index used in most contracts is the S&amp;P 500 index of common stocks. Indexed annuities were introduced in the mid-1990s and have exhibited steady growth in the marketplace. Indexed annuities are complex instruments with combinations of features which affect the crediting of interest.
{{Warning|
''Equity-indexed annuities are '''''strongly not recommended''''' for most investors. Interest paid by EIAs is not calculated with the usual formulas for calculating interest. EIA interest crediting methods are complex and have several moving parts. This makes it impossible to know at the time of purchase, how much interest, ''if any'', you will get from the annuity. The surrender fees can have a significant impact. Please ask in the forum for advice.''
}}

__TOC__
== Overview ==

EIA/FIAs are ''insurance contracts'', not ''investment vehicles''. The overview below attests to the underlying level of complexity inherent in these products, which eludes many investors.

Indexed insurance products, like most insurance retirement products, are designed for persons in a position to hold the products for a number of years. Accordingly, they may not be suitable for persons, regardless of age, who could not be expected to keep their products for the long term, or are looking for a product that will produce a stream of income in the near future. This is because surrender in the short term could be subject to surrender charges and tax consequences that could decrease the dollar value of benefits otherwise available.&lt;ref name="NAFA"&gt;[http://life.american-equity.com/tools/White-Paper-Final_Members_AmEquity.pdf White Paper], Fixed Indexed Insurance Products including "Fixed Indexed Annuities" and Other Fixed Insurance Products, by [http://nafa.com/about-nafa/ The National Association for Fixed Annuities], November 10, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Regulatory and industry concerns ==
Aggressive sellers of these annuities have been cited by critics for abusive sales practices.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasaa.org/5683/nasaa-commends-dateline-nbc-for-helping-expose-questionable-equity-indexed-annuity-sales-practices-to-seniors/ NASAA Commends Dateline NBC for Helping Expose Questionable Equity Indexed Annuity Sales Practices to Seniors], NASAA news release, WASHINGTON, D.C. April 14, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the SEC proposed to regulate (rule 151A) EIA's as securities, over the opposition of state insurance commissioners, who had previously been responsible for regulation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.investmentnews.com/article/20080714/REG/894091847 State insurance regulators are angry about EIA proposal], Investment News, July, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  In July 2010, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ordered that the SEC rule to regulate EIA's  be vacated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.wsj.com/financial-adviser/2010/07/16/some-advisers-dismayed-by-indexed-annuity-regulation/ Some Advisers Dismayed By Indexed Annuity Regulation], WSJ article, July 16, 2010 &lt;/ref&gt; That same month, the Harkin-Meeks amendment (Section 989J) to the Dodds-Frank legislation denied the SEC regulatory authority over indexed annuities and placed regulation under state law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jordenburt.com/attach/3571/Cohen+ALI-ABA.pdf INDEXED AND OTHER FIXED INSURANCE PRODUCTS:SEC, FINRA AND STATE REGULATION AFTER AMERICAN EQUITY OPINION AND DODD-FRANK ACT], ALI-ABA Conference, October 28-29, 2010, Washington D.C. &lt;/ref&gt;

A September 2008 study by the [http://www.slcg.com/ Securities Litigation &amp; Consulting Group] concluded that equity indexed annuities contain hidden costs, are very complex to understand, and have lower returns than mutual fund investments.&lt;ref name="SLCG"&gt;[http://www.slcg.com/pdf/workingpapers/EIA%20White%20Paper.pdf An Economic Analysis of Equity-Indexed Annuities], September 10, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; A number of this study's conclusions were later refuted in a November 2008 symposium.&lt;ref name="Ibbot"&gt;[http://corporate.morningstar.com/ib/documents/UserGuides/UnSupermodelsFIA.pdf Un-Supermodels and the FIA], November 11, 2008, David F. Babbel, Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania.&lt;/ref&gt;

The FINRA (Financial Industry Regulatory Authority) has issued an alert on these products, which is listed [[#External links | below]].

== How they work ==
An ''indexed'' annuity is a contract issued by a life insurance company that generally provides for accumulation of the purchaser's payments, followed by payment of the accumulated value to the purchaser either as a lump sum, upon death or withdrawal, or as a series of payments (an [[Immediate Fixed Annuity - SPIA|income annuity]]). During the accumulation period, the insurer ''credits'' the purchaser with a return that is based on changes in a securities index, such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average, [[Bloomberg US Aggregate Bond Index|Bloomberg US Aggregate U.S. Index]], Nasdaq 100 Index, or Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Composite Stock Price Index.&lt;ref name="CFR"&gt;[http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/search/pagedetails.action?granuleId=E9-597&amp;packageId=FR-2009-01-16&amp;collectionCode=FR&amp; Indexed Annuities and Certain Other Insurance Contracts; Final Rule] Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 11 / Friday, January 16, 2009 / Rules and Regulations&lt;/ref&gt;

The insurer offers a minimum guaranteed interest rate (minimum guaranteed return) combined with an interest rate linked to a market index. The guaranteed minimum return is typically at least 87.5 percent of the premium paid at 1 to 3 percent interest.

The specific features of indexed annuities vary from product to product.

Indexed annuities credit interest using a formula based on changes in the index to which the annuity is linked. The formula decides how the additional interest, ''if any'', is calculated and credited.&lt;ref&gt;The formulas for crediting interest can be found at [http://www.gofigurenow.com/SamplePDF/CreditingMethods.pdf Crediting Methods], from [http://www.gofigurenow.com/Annuity/Credit.aspx# Go Figure Now!]&lt;/ref&gt; It is essential to understand not only the individual features, but how they work together.

==== Indexing method ====
There are several methods for determining the change in the relevant index over the period of the annuity. These varying methods impact the calculation of the amount of interest to be credited to the contract based on a change in the index.&lt;ref name="FINRA"&gt;[http://www.finra.org/Investors/ProtectYourself/InvestorAlerts/AnnuitiesAndInsurance/p010614 Equity-Indexed Annuities—A Complex Choice], from the [http://www.finra.org/AboutFINRA/ Financial Industry Regulatory Authority] (FINRA)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Annual reset (ratcheting): Compares the change in the index from the beginning to the end of each year.
* High-water mark: Looks at the index value at various points during the contract, usually annual anniversaries. It then takes the highest of these values and compares it to the index level at the start of the term.
* Point-to-point: Compares the change in the index at two discrete points in time, such as the beginning and ending dates of the contract term.

Below are parameters used by the indexing methods to determine the crediting rate:

*'''Term:''' The index term is the period over which index-linked interest is calculated.&lt;ref name ="IL"&gt;[http://www.insurance.illinois.gov/Life_Annuities/equityindex.asp Buyer's Guide To Equity-Indexed Annuities], from the [http://insurance.illinois.gov/main/about.asp Illinois Department of Insurance]&lt;/ref&gt; 
*'''Participation Rate:''' The participation rate decides how much of the increase in the index will be used to calculate index-linked interest. For example, if the calculated change in the index is 9% and the participation rate is 80%, the index-linked interest rate for your annuity will be 7.2% = (9% x 80%).&lt;ref name="FINRA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gaillardetz"&gt;Participation rates and cap rates are subject to change at the discretion of the insurance company, at least partly due to changes in the costs of the insurance company's options hedge as a result of changing market interest rates and changes in market volatility. See Gaillardetz, Patrice, and X Sheldon Lin, [http://www.soa.org/library/pdftest/journals/north-american-actuarial-journal/2006/october/naaj0604_8.pdf “Valuation of equity-linked insurance and annuity products with binomial models.”], North American Actuarial Journal 10:4 (October, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Spread/Margin/Asset Fee:''' The index-linked interest rate may use a spread, margin or asset fee ''in addition to'', or instead of, a participation rate. This percentage will be subtracted from any gain in the index linked to the annuity. For example, if the index gained 9 percent and the spread/margin/asset fee is 3.4 percent, then the gain in the annuity would be only 5.6 percent.&lt;ref name="FINRA" /&gt; 
*'''Interest Rate Cap:''' There may be a "cap" or upper limit on your return. Generally stated as a percentage, this is the maximum rate of interest the annuity will earn. For example, if the index linked to the annuity gained 12 percent and the cap rate was 8 percent, then the gain in the annuity would be 8 percent.&lt;ref name="FINRA" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Gaillardetz"/&gt;
* '''Floor:''' The minimum index-linked interest rate you will earn. The most common floor is 0%. A 0% floor assures that even if the index decreases in value, the index-linked interest that you earn will be zero and not negative.&lt;ref name ="IL" /&gt;

Some indexing methods use these built-in features:
*'''Index Averaging:''' An index may be averaged, rather than use the actual value on a specified date, which may reduce the amount of index-linked interest you earn.&lt;ref name="FINRA" /&gt;
*'''Interest calculation:''' Interest may be calculated as simple or compound. Simple interest calculation methods will result in a lower return than a compounded method.

=== Exclusion of dividends ===
Most equity indexed annuities only count equity index gains from market price changes, ''excluding any gains from dividends'', i.e. [[Stock Market Indexing#Index Types|price indexes]] track stock prices excluding dividends. Since you're not earning dividends, you won't earn as much as if you invested directly in the market.&lt;ref name="FINRA" /&gt; Note that this will be less than the return on an investment in a mutual fund tracking that index. Keep in mind that the insurance company does not invest in stocks (which provides dividends) but uses options, which do not provide dividends.

=== Surrender Charges ===
Surrender charges are commonly deducted from withdrawals taken by a purchaser. The maximum surrender charges, which may be as high as 15-20%, are imposed on surrenders made during the early years of the contract and decline gradually to 0% at the end of a specified surrender charge period, which can range from as low as 4 to 5 years in some contracts to an excess of 15 years in other contracts.&lt;ref name="CFR" /&gt;

Imposition of a surrender charge may have the effect of reducing or eliminating any index-based return credited to the purchaser up to the time of a withdrawal. In addition, a surrender charge may result in a loss of principal, so that a purchaser who surrenders prior to the end of the surrender charge period may receive less than the original purchase payments. 

Many indexed annuities permit purchasers to withdraw a portion of contract value each year, typically 10%, without payment of surrender charges.&lt;ref name="CFR" /&gt;

Any withdrawals from an indexed annuity prior to age 59 and 1/2 will be subject to the 10% federal penalty tax for early withdrawals.

== Recovery of investment ==
As stated above, many insurance companies only guarantee that you'll receive 87.5 percent of the premiums you paid, plus 1 to 3 percent interest. Therefore, if you don't receive any index-linked interest due to declines in the index, and do not hold the annuity to maturity, you could lose money on your investment (get less back then you invested).

Consider that a guarantee of 87.5% of purchase payments, accumulated at 1% interest compounded annually, would take approximately 13 years for a purchaser's guaranteed minimum value to be 100% of purchase payments.&lt;ref name="CFR" /&gt; On the other hand, at 3% interest, the purchase price would be recovered in approximately 5 years.

In addition, some insurance companies will not credit you with index-linked interest when you surrender your annuity early.&lt;ref name="FINRA"&gt;[http://www.finra.org/Investors/ProtectYourself/InvestorAlerts/AnnuitiesAndInsurance/p010614 Equity-Indexed Annuities—A Complex Choice], from the [http://www.finra.org/AboutFINRA/ Financial Industry Regulatory Authority] (FINRA)&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''{{PAGENAME}}''', also known as a 702(j) plan, is simply a rebranding of a [[life insurance]] contract. The name comes from Section 7702 of the IRS code,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/7702| title=26 U.S. Code § 7702 - Life insurance contract defined| publisher=Legal Information Institute| accessdate=September 12, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt; which regulates life insurance contracts. The goal is usually to 'overfund' the life insurance, to the point where the policy value can later be borrowed from to fund retirement costs.

{{Warning|
7702 plans, also known as 702(j) plans, are life insurance products marketed as retirement plans. These plans are '''strongly not recommended''' for most investors. ''Please ask in the forum for advice.''}}

A 7702 can be seen as equivalent to an [[IRA]], [[Roth IRA]] or [[401(k)]] plan, but invested in life insurance products.

== Is a 7702 right for me? ==

'Overfunded' life insurance has long been a popular strategy among the ultra wealthy, as it allows sheltering far more income from taxes than otherwise allowed by law. For the majority however, the picture is far more murky. With a 7702 plan you must forgo current tax breaks, and any offered employer contribution to your retirement. The plans are almost impossible to compare, and are quite complex. You have to make a lot of assumptions to predict the performance of these plans, including speculating about future tax rates. Many of the rates in the plan are subject to unilateral change by the insurance company.

A typical Bogleheads' view of a 7702 is that it is yet another high cost investment option with unproven benefits.

== Investments that never go down ==
{{See also|Equity-indexed annuity}}
A typical sales pitch for a 7702 plan includes investment that can go up, but never go down. Rarely mentioned are the details of how this is done. Such an indexing scheme typically works something like this:

* Take the price (but usually not the dividends) of a major index like the Dow Jones Industrials.
* In years when the price goes down, $0 is credited to the cash value of the life insurance.
* In years when the price goes up, most of the increase is credited to the cash value. But the amount is capped, typically at 10%.

Thus for a sizeable cut of the potential gains, the insurance company will smooth out the bumps of the stock market for you. Over shorter periods of time, the insurance company may lose out significantly. Over long periods of time, the insurance company makes a large profit. A typical contract allows the insurance company to adjust the cap and participation rate at any time (even if that reduces your gains).

== Money when you need it ==

A typical insurance contract allows you to borrow from the cash value of the account. In a 7702 scheme, the plan includes borrowing. Just be aware there is an unknowable interest cost involved – insurance company interest rates (which they can change at any time). In comparison, with an IRA you can take your own contributions back out with no fees whatsoever, and you have access to money for education expenses and home buying, in addition to unrestricted access at retirement age.

{{for|a full discussion|wikipedia:Retirement plans in the United States}}

A '''qualified retirement plan''' is a plan that meets the requirements of Internal Revenue Code Section [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/401 401(a)] and the [[Employee Retirement Income Security Act - ERISA | Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA)]] and therefore qualifies for favorable tax treatment.

For the employer, these plans allow deduction of annual allowable contributions by each participant. For the employee, contributions and earnings are tax-deferred until withdrawn.

Broadly speaking, a qualified retirement plan will fit into one of two categories: [[Employer retirement plans overview#Defined benefit plan (qualified) | defined benefit]] or [[Employer retirement plans overview#Defined contribution plan (qualified) | defined contribution]].

{{hatnote|For a full discussion, see [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/k/keoghplan.asp Keogh Plan: Definition, Types, Pros, and Cons]}}
Established by the US Congress in 1962, the the '''{{PAGENAME}}''' (named after US Representative James Keogh of New York) is a [[Qualified retirement plan | qualified retirement plan]]. It is also known as an H.R. 10 plan. It is not an [[Traditional IRA | IRA]] (Individual Retirement Account).

==Plan type==
Intended for self-employed individuals, a Keogh plan is a [[Qualified retirement plan | qualified retirement plan]] that may either be a [[Defined benefit pension plan | defined benefit plan]] or a [[Employer retirement plans overview#Defined contribution plan | defined contribution plan]].

A sole proprietor or a partnership can set up one of these plans. A common-law employee or a partner ''cannot'' set up one of these plans.&lt;ref name="Pub560"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p560.pdf| title=IRS Publication 560: Retirement Plans for Small Business (SEP, SIMPLE, and Qualified Plans)| accessdate=August 25, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contributions and withdrawals==

Similar to other [[Qualified Retirement Plan | qualified retirement plans]], funds can be accessed as early as 59 1/2 and withdrawals must begin by age 70 1/2.

Contributions are tax-deferred until age 59 1/2. Distributions must occur at age 70 1/2.

The maximum amount that can be contributed generally changes each year. A person who is employed but who also receives self-employment income is eligible to open up a Keogh plan. The IRS requires that employees under a Keogh plan be at least 21, be full-time, and have worked for at least one year.

==Administration==
(Employer perspective) Keoghs are known to have more administrative burdens and higher upkeep costs than [[SEP | Simplified Employee Pension (SEP) plans]], but the contribution limits are higher, making Keoghs a popular option for many business owners and proprietors.

{{hatnote|For a full discussion, see [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sarsep.asp Salary Reduction Simplified Employee Pension Plan (SARSEP) Definition]}}

A '''Salary Reduction Simplified Employee Pension Plan''' (SARSEP) is a simplified employee pension ([[SEP]]) plan set up before 1997 that includes a salary reduction arrangement. Under a SARSEP, employees can choose to have the employer contribute part of their pay to their Individual Retirement Account or Annuity (IRA) set up under the SARSEP (a SEP-IRA). A SARSEP may not be established after 1996. However, for SARSEPs set up before 1997, eligible employees hired after 1996 must be allowed to participate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/plan-sponsor/salary-reduction-simplified-employee-pension-plan-sarsep| title=Salary Reduction Simplified Employee Pension plan (SARSEP)| publisher=IRS| accessdate=July 9, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 (EGTRRA) changed many of the Internal Revenue Code's requirements and limits for qualified plans and IRAs. If a model SARSEP plan was used, an updated model plan should have been adopted by the end of 2002 to take advantage of new law changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/retirement-plans-faqs-regarding-sarseps#3| title=Retirement plans FAQs regarding SARSEPs| publisher=IRS| accessdate=July 9, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== How to campaign for a better 401(k) plan == 

From an individual investor's perspective [[401(k)]] plans can be great, acceptable, or very poor. Poor plans are characterized by very high costs and lack of fund choices. If your plan does not have reasonable fees and lacks even a few low-cost index choices, then you may want to approach your company’s management with some suggestions for improving the plan.

=== The Rules ===
Your company has an obligation to provide fiduciary responsibility for your 401(k) plan under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://benefitslink.com/erisa/cross-reference.html| title=ERISA: Cross Reference to Sections in United States Code| publisher=BenefitsLink| accessdate=June 27, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt; Responsibility for the interpretation and enforcement of ERISA is divided among the Department of Labor, the Department of the Treasury (particularly the Internal Revenue Service), and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. 

Listed below are the most important aspects of this responsibility according to Internal Revenue code IRC 401(k) - Operating a 401(k) plan. 

*''Acting solely in the interest of plan participants and their beneficiaries, with the exclusive purpose of providing benefits to them;''
*''Carrying out their duties with skill, prudence, and diligence;''
*''Following the plan documents (unless inconsistent with ERISA);''
*''Diversifying plan investments;''
*''Paying only reasonable expenses of administering the plan and investing its assets; and''
*''Avoiding conflicts of interest''

=== Preparation ===
{{Notice|
'''Is your 401(k) or 403(b) plan in compliance with the final rule Reasonable Contract or Arrangement Under Section 408(b)(2)--Fee Disclosure?'''

By now, employers should know every cost that the company pays for the plan. Also, employees should know every cost that they pay. On or before November 14, 2012, service providers should have given employers a fee disclosure statement. In turn, employers should have given employees a disclosure statement that shows the fees that employees pay for the plan. In addition to the fee disclosure statement, employees are receiving quarterly statements that show the fees that they pay.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;For more information, see: {{forum link| p=1465396| title=401(k) and 403(b) fee disclosure}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
}}
Before you can make a case for a better plan, you must be fully prepared with facts about your current plan and how it is out of compliance. Here is what you need to do: First check the expense ratios of the funds offered. High expense ratios (averaging 1% or more), loads, and 12b-1 fees present red flags. Second, limited fund choices, inadequate diversification, and no index funds options should also put you on the alert. If these warning signs are apparent, then it is necessary to investigate further. The following four items should be completed. 

#'''Find out who the fiduciaries are.''' Every company offering a 401(k) plan must have at lest one fiduciary identified by name or title held. Some large companies may have a committee for this purpose. Be aware that the person or persons designated as fiduciaries may not know any more than the average investor when it comes to investing fundamentals about costs and proper diversification because the only knowledge they have acquired is from their plan provider. 
# '''Request all documents related to the plan.''' This gets to the heart of the transparency issue. You may need to review:
##Your Individual Account Statement
##Your Individual Benefits Statement (supplied by written request once every twelve months)
##Summary Plan Description (provided when you join the plan and infrequently thereafter.)
##Summary Plan Report (normally distributed once a year) 
##Summary of Material Modification. This document, or an updated summary Plan Description, must be provided within a specified number of days following any plan changes. 
##Form 5500 which is required to be filed with the IRS and should be available to plan participants upon request.
#'''Excessive fees.''' The expense ratios of the funds offered will tip you off that compliance may be an issue. If the fund expenses you can easily find exceed 1%, or there are loads or 12b-1 fees, it is an indication that the entire plan may be out of compliance. Total costs in some plans can be in the range of a totally unacceptable 3-5%.{{#tag:ref|In 2011, the Investment Company Institute (ICI) commissioned Deloitte to make a study of 401k fees. The study, "Inside the Structure of Defined Contribution/401(k) Plan Fees", surveys 525 401k plans. According to the study, 401(k) plans tend to lower plan expenses as plan assets increase. The study provides mean, median, 10th percentile, and 90th percentile all-in plan expenses for the year 2011, with a comparison to 2009 expenses. The study also provides the average costs for various 401(k) asset class portfolios.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.ici.org/doc-server/pdf%3Arpt_11_dc_401k_fee_study.pdf| title=Inside the Structure of Defined Contribution/401(k) Plan Fees| publisher=Deloitte| date=November 2011| accessdate=June 27, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group="note"}} The Department of Labor recently required plan providers to give plan sponsors a detailed list of fees in a prospectus form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.dol.gov/ebsa/newsroom/fsparticipantfeerule.html| title=Final Rule to Improve Transparency of Fees and Expenses to Workers in 401(k)-Type Retirement Plans Fees| publisher=Department of Labor}}{{dead link}}&lt;/ref&gt; Costs may include: 
##'''Fees associated with investment choices''':
###Fund expense ratios
###Sales charges (You may have funds with front-end loads, but they are often waived. Confirm this.)
###Advisory fees
###Service fees
###Plan Fees
##'''Plan administration fees'''
###Investment management fees
###Individual service fees
###revenue sharing fees (very difficult to track down)
#'''Lack of proper diversification''', including no index fund choices. 

401(k) plans must offer a diversified selection of funds. And the following quote from an article titled "A Look at 401(k) Plan Fees"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.dol.gov/ebsa/publications/401k_employee.html| title=A Look at 401(k) Plan Fees| publisher=Department of Labor}}{{dead link}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the U.S. Department of Labor says
{{blockquote|While actively managed funds seek to provide higher returns than the market, neither active management nor higher fees necessarily guarantee higher returns. Funds that are "passively managed" generally have lower management fees. Passively managed funds seek to obtain the investment results of an established market index.}}

That statement may be interpreted to mean at least a few index funds should be available.

=== Approaching your company ===
Your approach should begin with a letter to one of the fiduciaries. Do not be confrontational. Instead, express your concerns about the welfare of employees trying to build sufficient retirement assets. Additionally, you might also include your concerns about the company's potential liability with regard to fines and both individual and class action law suits. Offer suggestions on how ERISA compliance can be met. 

In follow-up discussions, be prepared with information and examples of the corrosive effects of high fees and poor diversification on long term investment returns. In many cases, the simple addition of three or four index funds may be all that is needed. 

==== Here is a template for a sample letter: ====

{{blockquote|
Dear (company plan administrator),
&lt;p&gt;I am appreciative of the company’s providing a tax deferred plan to help employees prepare for retirement by long-term investing. However, after studying the investments available in the plan, I am concerned that there are few options for employees who wish to invest efficiently for the long-term. Most, if not all, of the fund choices in the company tax deferred plan are high cost actively managed funds which will not do the job of retirement investing. Over long periods of time, even a difference of one percent in fees can add up, through the effect of compounding, to a reduction in the end value of the an employee’s account of almost 20%. After 30 years, that can mean losses exceeding $100,000. Because many employees are counting on this plan to see them through a lengthy retirement, I believe the company has a fiduciary duty to provide adequate fund investments to attain that goal. That fiduciary duty could be easily met by the addition of just a few index funds to the company plan. Such funds are available from Vanguard and Fidelity. This is a strategy that even Warren Buffet recommends:&lt;/p&gt;
:''"Most investors, both institutional and individual, will find that the best way to own common stocks is through an index fund that charges minimal fees. Those following this path are sure to beat the net results (after fees and expenses) delivered by the great majority of investment professionals." --Warren Buffett Berkshire Hathaway Annual Letter, 1996
&lt;p&gt;Warren Buffett’s recommendation is consistent with the great majority of academic research done on investment costs and index fund performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) regulators have recently turned their attention to 401(k) plans with high fees, and as a result there have been a number of lawsuits that have been filed over the issue of high fund expenses. Consequently, I believe that the company could insulate itself from legal problems by providing low cost, index fund options.&lt;/p&gt;
Sincerely....}}

The '''SIMPLE (Savings Incentive Match Plan for Employees) IRA''' was established in 1996 by the Small Business Job Protection Act.&lt;ref&gt; [http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=104_cong_public_laws&amp;docid=f:publ188.104.pdf Small Business Job Protection Act]&lt;/ref&gt; At year end 2016, SIMPLE IRAs held approximately $106 billion dollars of assets, comprising a 1% share of total IRA assets.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ici.org/research/stats/retirement ICI Retirement Market], spreadsheet Report: The U.S. Retirement Market, Second Quarter 2017 (xls)&lt;/ref&gt;

SIMPLE IRAs may be sponsored by employers (including governmental employers, non-profit employers, self-employed individuals and business owners) with 100 or fewer employees. Employers who maintain a SIMPLE IRA cannot contribute to any other employer-sponsored retirement plan in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/retirement-plans-faqs-regarding-simple-ira-plans#establishing SIMPLE IRA Plan FAQs - Establishing a SIMPLE IRA Plan]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of SIMPLE plans==
The IRS allows two types of SIMPLE plans to be set up by employers: form 5304-SIMPLE&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f5304sim.pdf 5304-SIMPLE], IRS&lt;/ref&gt; and form 5305-SIMPLE&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f5305sim.pdf 5305-SIMPLE], IRS&lt;/ref&gt; plans. From the employee's perspective, there is a major difference between these plan types.

Form 5304-SIMPLE plans give each employee the freedom to select the financial institution that will act as custodian for their SIMPLE plan account. Using the "Model Salary Reduction Agreement" that their employer gives them at least once a year (no later than 60 days before the beginning of the next calendar year), the employee is allowed to select the financial institution that will serve as the trustee, custodian, or issuer of their SIMPLE IRA. Even if their employer has a "preferred" financial institution, the employee is nevertheless free to request that an account be set up for them at an alternative institution. If taking advantage of this option, the employee must allow their employer time to set up their new account.

In some cases form 5304-SIMPLE plans are set up to allow salary reduction and account custodian changes more often than once a year. Refer to Article II, subparagraph 2b ("Timing of Salary Reduction Elections") on page 1 of the form to see if your employer has opted for more frequent changes. Choices could be semi-annually, quarterly, monthly, or daily.

Form 5305-SIMPLE plans do not allow employees the freedom to select their own account custodian. Rather the employer designates the financial institution that all employees must use. If you are unhappy with this choice of financial institution, you would need to work with your employer to change to a better financial institution. Since this requires a modification of the SIMPLE plan itself, such a switch can only be made at the beginning of a calendar year.&lt;ref&gt;Refer to the last section of [http://www.irs.gov/retirement/article/0,,id=111402,00.html Establishing a SIMPLE IRA Plan] titled "Timing of Setting Up a SIMPLE IRA Plan".&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contributions==
Employers may make [[Employer matching contributions|matching]] or nonelective contributions to an employee's account. In general, all employees who receive at least $5,000 in compensation for the current calendar year and who received at least $5,000 during any two previous years are eligible.

Employees covered under collective bargaining agreements for which retirement benefits were the subject of good-faith bargaining can be excluded. [[Nonresident alien taxation|Nonresident aliens]] with no U.S.-source income can be excluded.

If you choose matching contributions, you must match each employee's contribution up to 3% of eligible compensation. If you choose nonelective contributions, you must contribute 2% of eligible compensation for each eligible employee, even if the employee chooses not to contribute.&lt;ref&gt;[https://personal.vanguard.com/us/whatweoffer/smallbusiness/simpleira?Link=facet Vanguard SIMPLE IRA Overview]&lt;/ref&gt;

The employee contribution can be up to 100% of compensation (earned income, for self-employed individuals), up to the following limits:

The employee contribution counts toward the employee's combined salary deferral limit along with 401(k), 403(b) and SARSEP plans ($23,500 in 20254, $24,500 in 2026, excluding catch-up contributions).&lt;ref&gt;[https://personal.vanguard.com/us/accounttypes/retirement/ATSSimpleIRAEligibilityContContent.jsp Vanguard Who can contribute and how much]&lt;/ref&gt;

Contributions made to a SIMPLE IRA qualify for the Retirement Savings Contributions Credit ([[Saver's credit|Saver's Credit]]) if you meet the filing and income requirements.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.irs.gov/publications/p571/ch10.html Retirement Savings Contributions Credit (Saver's Credit)], Publication 571, IRS &lt;/ref&gt;

== Tax treatment of contributions ==
SIMPLE IRA contributions are deductible to the employer (to the extent they would be if paid as salary) and are not included in employees' income, though the contributions out of salary, but not matching or nonelective contributions, are subject to FICA and FUTA taxes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irs.gov/Retirement-Plans/Operating-a-SIMPLE-IRA-Plan Operating a SIMPLE IRA Plan], from the IRS, viewed June 19, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The SIMPLE IRA itself is subject to the same tax rules as other IRAs, including exemption from tax on most investment income.

== Withdrawals ==

SIMPLE IRAs are subject to most of the same rules governing withdrawals, and their tax consequences, as other IRAs. Employees are always fully vested and can withdraw any amount at any time.

As with other IRAs, withdrawals, other than rollovers, are ordinary income (as SIMPLE IRAs never include after-tax contributions), and are subject to a 10% penalty before age 59 1/2, subject to certain exceptions. Until the second anniversary of the first contribution to an employee's account, rollovers are permitted only to other SIMPLE IRAs. During this period, the 10% penalty is increased to 25%. SIMPLE IRAs are subject to the same required minimum distributions, beginning at age 73, as other IRAs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p590.pdf IRS Pub 590] p.74.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transfers==

Some SIMPLE plans (including those established with the IRS model plan Form 5305-SIMPLE) require the use of a "designated financial institution" as trustee or custodian of the employees' SIMPLE IRAs. In that event, the employees must be given the option of transferring their balances to any other SIMPLE IRA, or, after the 2-year period, any other IRA, without any cost or penalty. The financial institution may require notice prior to the start of a year. Cost-less transfers may be limited to new contributions; surrender penalties could be imposed on withdrawals of past contributions. Monthly transfers are sufficient for this purpose.

An '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a type of [[401(k)]] sub-account, with different rules from traditional and [[401(k)#Roth 401(k)|Roth 401(k)]] accounts. The rules, and even the availability, for this sub-account may vary considerably from one company to another. An investor should reference their Summary Plan Description to confirm all plan features such as availability, limits, and matching contributions.

It is typically used in a strategy informally known as the [[mega-backdoor Roth]], in order to rollover money to [[Roth IRA|Roth accounts]] far above normal contribution limits. (See the [[mega-backdoor Roth]] article for details.)

== After-tax 401(k) limits ==
Assume that:

: &lt;math&gt; A = \text{employee contribution to after-tax 401(k) account} &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; TR = \text{employee contribution to traditional 401(k) and Roth 401(k) accounts} &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; E = \text{employer match} &lt;/math&gt;

Then the 2026 IRS limits, for employees under age 50, are:

: &lt;math&gt; TR \leq 24500 \quad \text{and} \quad A \,\leq 72000 - (TR + E) &lt;/math&gt;

Additionally, each of the above must be less than the employee's wages.

Said in words: 
Traditional and Roth accounts share an employee (under age 50) contribution limit up to $23,500 per person for 2025, $24,500 for 2026, or 100% of the employee's compensation, whichever is less. However, Section 415(c)(1)(A) limits total contributions to defined contribution plans to $70,000 in 2025 and $72,000 in 2026, or 100% of the employee's compensation, whichever is less.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/401k-limit-increases-to-24500-for-2026-ira-limit-increases-to-7500| title=401(k) limit increases to $243,500 for 2026, IRA limit increases to $7,5000| publisher=IRS| accessdate=27 November 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-25-67.pdf|title=Notice 2025-67|publisher=IRS|accessdate=27 November 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The limit for an after-tax 401(k) is the lesser of the difference between the amount already contributed by the employer and employee, and the Section 415 limit, or 100% of employee compensation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/415| title=&lt;nowiki&gt;[USC10]&lt;/nowiki&gt; 26 USC 415(c): Limitation for defined contribution plans| accessdate=September 10, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Example===
To elaborate, consider an individual with an annual salary of $100,000. She maxes out her 2024 traditional 401(k) contribution ($23,000) with a company match of 5% ($100,000 &amp;times; 0.05). How much can she contribute to the after-tax 401(k)?

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center;"
|-
! style=max-width:15em | Individual contribution (traditional 401k + Roth 401k)
! style=min-width:9em | Company match
! style=max-width:17em | Maximum after-tax 401k contribution
|-
| $24,500
| $5,000 
| 72,000 - (24,500 + 5,000) = $42,500
|}
This same individual has both a traditional and a Roth 401(k). She then makes equal contributions to each 401(k). Her 2025 individual contribution cap of $24,500 has not changed. Assuming the employer match is same for both the traditional and Roth 401(k)s, the calculation remains the same as outlined above.

===A more complex example===

Consider an investor who switches jobs partway through the year: they first work at employer A, and then switch to an unrelated employer B for the rest of the year. 

If the  investor were to max out their traditional 401(k) with employer A ($24,500), they would not be able to contribute to employer B's traditional or Roth 401(k) accounts. However, they can still contribute to employer B's after-tax 401(k) account, as shown below. This is because the $24,500 traditional/Roth limit is per ''employee'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=IRS|url= https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/how-much-salary-can-you-defer-if-youre-eligible-for-more-than-one-retirement-plan|title= How Much Salary Can You Defer if You’re Eligible for More than One Retirement Plan?|date=November 12, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the $72,000 limit is per ''employer''.&lt;ref name=multiple-employer-limits &gt;
{{cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-25-67.pdf|title=Notice 2025-67|publisher=IRS|accessdate=27 November 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt; Note that the employers must be unrelated for this to hold.&lt;ref name=multiple-employer-limits /&gt;

! style=max-width:13em | Individual contribution (traditional + Roth 401k)

|-

| $24,500
| $5,000 
| 72,000 - (24,500 + 5,000) = $42,500
|-

| —
| —
| $72,000
|}

==Taxation==

'''Post-1986 after-tax contributions''' to the after-tax subaccount are not tax deductible, they are not taxed upon distribution. The earnings however, are taxed as ordinary income upon distribution. Distributions from the account must have a pro-rata share of both contributions and earnings.  (IRS Notice 87-13) 

The IRS issued Notice 2014-54&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-14-54.pdf| title=Notice 2014-54| publisher=IRS| accessdate=June 8, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; which allows distribution sent to multiple destinations at the same time.  An example of a distribution enabled by the notice is to have the contributions sent to a Roth IRA, and the earnings sent to an IRA.

Due to the lack of deduction and ordinary income taxation, the tax characteristics are similar to a nondeductible IRA. If the money grows over long periods of time, the tax characteristics might be less favorable then investing in a taxable account. 

An investor might choose to to make after-tax contributions if they have a plan to convert them to Roth, ideally timing is yearly, but if an investor is leaving a company within a few years, it might still be beneficial to make contributions.

'''Pre-1987 after-tax contributions''' do not have the pro-rata distribution rule as long as the recordkeeper tracked these dollars. These types of after-tax contributions are not common, but can be found from time to time in older folks who have chosen to maintain their 401k at their previous place of employment.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an arrangement where an employer pays out some part of an employee's income at a date later than they earned the income. Examples include pensions, retirement plans, and stock options. The primary benefit of most deferred compensation plans is that they defer tax.

When used in context as an employer's ''Deferred compensation plan'', it refers to a contract between employer and employee. See: [[Employer retirement plans overview#Deferred compensation plan (non-qualified) | Deferred compensation plan]].

{{Cleanup|reason=repetitive information}}

A '''Solo 401(k)''', (also known as a Self Employed 401(k), One-Participant 401(k), or Individual 401(k)), is a [[401(k)]] qualified retirement plan for Americans that was designed specifically for employers with no full-time employees other than the business owner(s) and their spouse(s). You can qualify if your business is organized as a sole proprietorship, a partnership, or a corporation (including both subchapter S and C corporations).&lt;ref&gt;[http://solo401k.bcmadvisors.com/eligibility.html Individual 401k Eligibility], Beacon Capital Management Advisors (defunct link). Also see: [https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/one-participant-401k-plans One-Participant 401(k) Plans], IRS.&lt;/ref&gt; The Solo 401(k) plan was enacted by the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 (EGTRRA).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-utl/egtrra_law.pdf Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 (EGTRRA)] &lt;/ref&gt;

As a [[Qualified retirement plan | qualified plan]], employee salary deferrals and employer contributions are made with pre-tax earnings, and invested funds are tax-deferred until they are withdrawn. Beginning in 2006, Solo 401(k) plans were permitted to offer designated Roth accounts which could accept designated Roth contributions. Designated Roth contributions are made with after-tax money and withdrawals are generally tax free.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irs.gov/retirement/article/0,,id=156204,00.html Designated Roth Accounts in 401(k) or 403(b) Plans], IRS &lt;/ref&gt;

To take a deduction for contributions for a tax year, your plan must be set up (adopted) by the last day of that year (December 31 for calendar-year employers).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.irs.gov/publications/p560 Publication 560, Retirement Plans for Small Business]&lt;/ref&gt;

As with all qualified plans, withdrawals prior to age 59 1/2 (age 55 if you are terminated) are subject to a 10% penalty tax, and required minimum distributions must begin at age 70 1/2 for retired individuals. 
 
==Contribution limits==

A Solo 401(k) contribution consists of two standard parts, an employee salary deferral contribution and an employer profit sharing contribution and an optional third part; employee after-tax contributions (currently only available from custom plans). The maximum allowable salary deferral contribution is $23,500 in 2025, $24,500 in 2026 (not to exceed 100% of pay and no more than $350,000 of pay for 2025, $360,000 for 2026 can be taken into account).&lt;ref name="BCM"&gt;[http://solo401k.bcmadvisors.com/contribution_limits/ Benefits of the Solo 401K] Beacon Capital Management Advisors, numbers last updated for 2014 (defunct link). Also see: [https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/one-participant-401k-plans One-Participant 401(k) Plans], IRS.&lt;/ref&gt;  If you are age 50 or older you can make a maximum $7,500 catch up contribution for 2025, $8,000 for 2026, $11,250 for ages 60-53 only. Depending on how the business is organized, 25% of employee salary or 20% of business earnings can be used for employer contributions. The combined employee and employer maximum contributions are subject to the lesser of 100% of compensation or $70,000 in 2025 or $72,000 in 2025.   The catch-up contributions do not count towards this limit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/401k-limit-increases-to-24500-for-2026-ira-limit-increases-to-7500| title=401(k) limit increases to $24,500 for 2026, IRA limit increases to $7,500| publisher=IRS| accessdate=27 November 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both salary deferrals and profit sharing contributions are discretionary, so contribution levels can be adjusted to the fluctuations of business income.

'''Solo 401(k) Contribution Calculation - for an S or C corporation or an LLC taxed as a corporation'''
* ''For W-2 Shareholder-employees'': Your compensation is your W-2 box 1 with Box 12 pre-tax contributions added back in.
* ''Employee Salary Deferral Contribution'': 100% of compensation up to the maximum of $24,000 in 2025, $24,500 in 2026 (plus catch-up if eligible) can be contributed to an Individual 401(k).
* ''Employer Profit Sharing Contribution'': A profit sharing contribution up to 25% of compensation can be contributed into an Individual 401(k).&lt;ref name= "BCM" /&gt;
* ''Employee after-tax Contribution'': 100% of compensation. The maximum employee after-tax contribution is the lesser of the two annual addition limits - employee deferrals - employer contributions.

'''Solo 401(k) Contribution Calculation - for a sole proprietorship, partnership or an LLC taxed as a sole proprietorship'''
* ''Employee Salary Deferral Contribution'': These business organizations do not provide a W-2 salary to the business owner. The employee salary deferral contribution is calculated by taking gross self-employment income and then subtracting business expenses and then subtracting 1/2 of the self-employment tax (this is termed ''net adjusted business profit''). 100% of net adjusted business profits  up to the maximum of $23,500 in 2025, $24,500 in 2026 (plus catch-up if eligible) can be contributed as employee salary deferrals into an Individual 401(k).
* For self-employed individuals, your compensation takes into account both the following items from your business profit:
** The deduction for the deductible part of your self-employment tax.
** The deduction for employer contributions on your behalf to the plan.
The calculation of the allowable contribution is figured on worksheets and tables from Publication 560 Retirement Plans for Small Business (SEP, SIMPLE, and Qualified Plans). See [https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/self-employed-individuals-calculating-your-own-retirement-plan-contribution-and-deduction Self-Employed Individuals – Calculating Your Own Retirement-Plan Contribution and Deduction] for an illustration. In effect, solving for maximum employee deferral = net adjusted business profit - (employer contributions * 2). 
* ''Employer Profit Sharing Contribution'': An employer profit sharing contribution can be made up to 20% of net adjusted businesses profit. Net adjusted business profit is calculated by taking gross self-employment income and then subtracting business expenses and then subtracting 1/2 of the self-employment tax.&lt;ref name= "BCM" /&gt;
* ''Employee After-tax Contribution'': 100% of net adjusted business profits. Your maximum after-tax contributions are limited to the $61K/$66K limit - employee deferrals - employer contributions and are additionally limited to business profit - 1/2 SE tax - employee deferrals - (employer contributions * 2).

==Loan provisions==
Not all Solo 401(k) plans allow loans.

If the Solo 401(k) plan document has a loan provision you can take a loan from the plan. Loans are limited up to  50% of the total 401(k) value up to a maximum of $50,000. Generally, Solo 401(k) loans have a 5-year maximum repayment term although loans used for the purchase of a primary residence may extend the loan repayment term up to 10-15 years. Loans must be repaid according to the terms of the loan amortization schedule which is provided when a loan is initiated.

Generally, the loan interest rate charged is the Prime Rate or Prime plus 1% or 2%. The interest rate depends on the Solo 401(k) provider. Failure to pay the loan according to the loan terms can trigger taxes and early withdrawal penalties, since the IRS deems the unpaid loan as an early distribution from the retirement account.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.solo401kloan.com/ Solo 401k Loans] Beacon Capital Management Advisors &lt;/ref&gt;

==Account rollovers==
Not all Solo 401(k) plans accept incoming rollovers.

If the Solo 401(k) plan document accepts rollovers, money can be transferred into the Solo 401(k) plan from [[Traditional IRA | traditional IRA]], [[SEP]], Qualified Plans or [[Keogh Plan | Keoghs]] (profit sharing, money purchase pension, defined benefit), 401(k), [[403(b)|403(b)]] and governmental [[457]] plans. [[SIMPLE IRA]]s are eligible for rollover after a two year holding period is met.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.401khelpcenter.com/small_business_index.html 401khelpcenter.com] &lt;/ref&gt; A "traditional" Solo 401(k) plan can be rolled over to another "traditional" 401(k) plan and into traditional IRA and [[Rollover IRA|rollover IRAs]]. Designated Roth accounts in a Solo 401(k) plan can be rolled over to another 401(k) plan with designated Roth accounts or to a Roth IRA.

==Designated Roth accounts==
Not all plans allow designated Roth accounts. If the plan document allows designated Roth accounts, you can make after-tax contributions to the designated Roth accounts in the Solo 401(k) plan and take tax free distributions of contributions and qualified earnings. Keep in mind the following features of designated Roth accounts in a Solo 401(k) plan:
:# The income limitations for contributing to a [[Roth IRA]] do not apply to making designated Roth contributions to a Solo 401(k) plan. The designated Roth accounts in a Solo 401(k) make it possible for high income self-employed individuals to make Roth contributions.
:# The designated Roth account is forbidden from taking employer contributions. The employer  contributions must be made to the pre-tax Solo 401(k) account.
:# [[Roth IRA#Distributions |Ordering rules]] for Roth IRA distributions do not apply to designated Roth accounts. Any distribution from the account is prorated according to the proportion of account basis and earnings in the account.&lt;ref&gt; Natalie Choate, ''Life and Death Planning for Retirement Benefits'', 6th Edition, p. 261. ISBN 0-9649440-7-3&lt;/ref&gt;
:# Withdrawals of earnings from a designated Roth account are subject to a penalty tax if they are taken prior to age 59 1/2 and if the account has not passed a five-year holding period. The five-year holding period does not carry over to a Roth IRA rollover. A rollover to a first time Roth IRA begins the holding period for the rollover. A rollover into an existing Roth IRA will receive the tenure of the existing IRA.&lt;ref&gt; Natalie Choate, ''Life and Death Planning for Retirement Benefits'', 6th Edition, pp. 267-269. ISBN 0-9649440-7-3&lt;/ref&gt;

Individuals who qualify for the Individual 401(k) have the following advantages:
:# The potential to shelter more earnings in the the Solo 401(k) than in a [[SEP]] or [[SIMPLE IRA]].
:# The Solo 401(k) can allow for loan provisions.
:# The Solo 401(k) can provide a Designated Roth 401(k) account.

==Solo 401(k) caveats==
Individuals considering a Solo 401(k) should keep in mind the following:
:#  Complexity and Costs: Although a Solo 401(k) plan is much simpler and less expensive than most standard 401(k) plans, costs and administrative burdens are critical factors to consider. The addition of plan options, such as loan provisions and designated Roth options may increase plan costs. Individuals will usually bear the following administrative tasks with the Solo 401(k) plan:
:##You must maintain accurate records, including beneficiary files for plan participants, and submit all required reports and notices to participants, the IRS (including 5500-EZ reporting), and the Department of Labor.
:## You must determine when employees are entitled to benefits under the plan.
:## You must instruct the investment custodian regarding plan contributions and distributions.&lt;ref&gt; [https://personal.vanguard.com/us/accounttypes/retirement/ATSI401KEasyAcctMgmtContent.jsp Vanguard Individual 401k plan] &lt;/ref&gt;
:#  Potential Solo 401(k) participants come from two basic groups: individual owners of businesses, and business employees who have outside consulting contracts or freelance earnings that are reported on IRS schedule C returns. These individuals may be contributing to their company's 401(k) plan. The annual employee contribution limits apply to '''all''' 401(k) plans, so if you are maxing out your employer plan you can only make employer contributions to a Solo 401(k) plan.
:#  If your business is likely to expand and require the addition of employees, the Solo 401(k) plan must become a full fledged standard 401(k) plan or be terminated.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.journalofaccountancy.com/Issues/2003/Mar/TheSingleParticipant401K.htm The Single-Participant 401(k)] , Juliette Fairley and Peter D. Fleming, ''Journal of Accountancy'', March 2003. &lt;/ref&gt;
:# A solo 401(k) plan may offer less [[asset protection]] than a standard 401(k) plan, because solo 401(k) plans are technically not ERISA plans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irafinancialgroup.com/solo401kassetprotection.php Solo 401K Asset Protection | Self Directed 401K | Solo 401K Creditor Protection | 401K Bankruptcy Protection | www.irafinancialgroup.com] accessed 21 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison to a SEP-IRA==

If you are self-employed with no employees, a Solo 401(k) and a [[SEP|SEP-IRA]] are the two most common choices. In general, a Solo 401(k) has more features and is usually the better choice. Although not common, if you won't benefit from any of the advantages of a Solo 401(k) (and won't plausibly in the foreseeable future), a SEP-IRA can be the better choice based on the simplicity and lack of a Form 5500-EZ filing requirement. Both SEP-IRAs and Solo 401(k)s can be opened at major brokerages for no cost.

===Solo 401(k) advantages===

*Solo 401(k) plans allow an elective deferral ($23,500 for 2025, $24,500 for 2026) in addition to either 20% of net business income or 25% of wages. This can allow larger contributions if you cannot reach the maximum contribution without the elective deferral (reached at $350,000 [2025] or $360,000 [2026] net business income). 
**You only get one elective deferral per year, regardless of how many employers or retirement plans you have. If you have a W-2 job, this feature is not nearly as much of a benefit, because contributing the elective deferral into your Solo 401(k) will reduce your allowable contributions into your employer's plan dollar-for-dollar. This could possibly still be a benefit if your employer's plan is [[401(k)#Expensive_or_mediocre_choices|not good]] and you don't get a [[Employer matching contributions|match]]. 
*Solo 401(k) plans can allow Roth contributions, in the form of Roth elective deferrals
**Roth SEP-IRA plans are now allowed per the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SECURE_2.0_Act SECURE 2.0 Act]. However, as of 2025, no major brokerages offer a Roth SEP-IRA. 
*Solo 401(k) plans can allow [[401(k)#Plan_loans|plan loans]].
*Pre-tax balances in a Solo 401(k) do not interfere with the [[Backdoor Roth IRA]] process, whereas pre-tax balances in a SEP-IRA do. This is because pre-tax SEP-IRA balances are included in the [[Traditional_IRA#The_%22pro-rata%22_rule|pro-rata calculation]] during the Roth conversion step. If your income precludes you from making [[Roth_IRA#Contribution_eligibility_and_limits|direct Roth IRA contributions]] (or if it plausibly could in the foreseeable future) and you might like to make IRA contributions, this is a major advantage for the Solo 401(k). 
*Custom Solo 401(k) plans can have more advanced features, such as allowing non-traditional investments (direct real estate investing, "checkbook" investments in small businesses, cryptocurrency, etc.) and [[Mega-backdoor Roth]] contributions.

===Solo 401(k) disadvantages===

*SEP-IRAs are simpler in general than Solo 401(k)s, as is the paperwork required to set them up
*Unlike SEP-IRAs, Solo 401(k)s require an annual filing of [https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-5500-ez IRS Form 5500-EZ] once the balance exceeds $250,000. The form is relatively easy to fill out, and can be filed for free online through [https://www.efast.dol.gov/welcome.html EFAST2]. However, the penalties for filing late are enormous - $250 per day, up to $150,000 per plan year - so don't forget!
**The IRS offers a Late Filer Penalty Relief Program for Form 5500-EZ. If you self-report and catch up on late filings, your penalties may be reduced to $500 per plan year, up to a maximum of $1,500 per plan.

This article describes easy-to-follow step by step instructions on how to set up a truly low cost 401(k) or 403(b) plan. Read this article and the forum thread at [http://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&amp;t=59347 Setting up a 401(K) plan].

{{Notice|
'''Is your 401(k) or 403(b) plan in compliance with the final rule Reasonable Contract or Arrangement Under Section 408(b)(2)--Fee Disclosure?'''

By now, employers should know every cost that the company pays for the plan. Also, employees should know every cost that they pay. On or before November 14, 2012, service providers should have given employers a fee disclosure statement. In turn, employers should have given employees a disclosure statement that shows the fees that employees pay for the plan. In addition to the fee disclosure statement, employees are receiving quarterly statements that show the fees that they pay.&lt;ref&gt;For more information, refer to the forum discussion [http://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&amp;t=101183&amp;p=1465396#p1465396 401(k) and 403(b) fee disclosure]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==
It would be great if every employer that has a [[401(k)]] or [[403(b) |403(b)]] plan and every employee who participates in the plan would take a few minutes to learn how to set up a truly low cost plan. Just think about it. If you are paying 3.00% (complete including recordkeeping and investments) for a plan, it means that you are paying $300.00 for every $10,000.00 invested. It makes no sense for you to pay thirty times more than you should for a 401(k) or 403(b) plan! Why would you want to pay that much, every year, when you can easily set up a plan that has great service plus low cost [[Indexing |index]] funds for not more than $10.00 for each $10,000.00 invested. If you are an employer or an employee and you believe that your plan is "free" or "low cost", consider the possibility that it may be because you have never been shown where to look to uncover the myriad  hidden and camouflaged costs that your plan has.&lt;ref&gt; See Hutcheson, Matthew D., "Uncovering and Understanding Hidden Fees in Qualified Retirement Plans-3rd Edition," The Elder Law Journal, (Fall, 2007). [http://www.401khelpcenter.com/pdf/mdh_understanding_fees_v4.pdf Link to PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ideas you can learn, right here, help employers and employees to get on the same page. That way you will communicate more effectively with each other and pull the wagon (401k plan) in the same direction.

'''If you are an employee''', you will learn how to talk to your employer in a way that is guaranteed to get them interested in improving your 401(k) or 403(b) plan. Please keep an open mind, and read the information provided about each of the Five Simple Steps shown below. Then, contact a Third Party Administrator (TPA) who can show your employer a comparison of why it makes sense to switch from your old 401(k) or 403(b) to a new one. Next, arrange a meeting between the TPA and your employer. Also, you can ask to attend the next committee meeting to present your ideas to the plan's fiduciaries. Easy! 

'''If you are an employer''', you will learn how to set up, manage, and monitor a truly low cost and optimal plan FAST. Please keep an open mind, and read the information provided about each of the Five Simple Steps shown below. Easy! 

Complete the Five Simple Steps shown below, and your plan will have... 

* a core menu of low cost index funds that employees choose their mix of investments from.&lt;ref&gt; See [[Edwin J. Elton|Elton, Edwin J]]., [[Martin J. Gruber|Gruber, Martin J.]] and [[Christopher R. Blake|Blake, Christopher R.]], "The Adequacy of Investment Choices Offered By 401K Plans" (March 15, 2004). EFA 2004 Maastricht Meetings Paper No. 1176 Available at [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=567122 SSRN] or DOI: 10.2139/ssrn.567122 &lt;/ref&gt;
* a low cost [[Self directed brokerage account |self-directed brokerage account]] option for employees who do not want to use index funds.
* a truly low cost recordkeeper and administrator.
* employees who are on the same page as the employer (plan sponsor) because they understand the mission and have learned how to communicate effectively with each other.
* the flexibility to cut costs fast because one or more of the plan's index funds can be replaced whenever lower cost index funds are available, and any of the plan's service providers can be replaced whenever a lower cost service provider can be hired. The idea is this: You will be able to fix whatever component needs to be fixed without having to replace the entire plan.   

'''Note:''' People at your organization should get together and agree on what the word "optimal" means for your 401(k) or 403(b) plan. That way you will see the target and the bulls eye and you can hit it. Remember, we are talking about optimal, not perfect. For instance, a perfect plan would probably have zero cost, its mix of investments would probably outperform the market, and it would require no time to manage and monitor, but no one would be able to set up a perfect plan by that definition. Here is what [http://www.thefreedictionary.com/optimum TheFreeDictionary] has to say about the word "optimum": a condition, degree, amount or compromise that produces the best possible result; most desirable possible under a restriction expressed or implied; "an optimum return on capital." 

An "optimal" plan matches the return of the market with a minimum of fund costs. With that in mind, below is a definition of the word "optimal" that people at your organization can work with to come up with your own definition: 
# Participants can choose from a menu of "optimal" investments, such as index funds, that will provide a market return (less fund costs). Index funds are designed to match the market's performance, and a good TPA (Third Party Administrator) can get low cost index funds such as Vanguard's Total Stock Market Index fund (0.07% per year).
# The cost for recordkeeping and administration will be not more than the current benchmark for the cost of those services. Most plans can hire a recordkeeper and administrator for not more than $30 per year, per eligible employee. 
# The plan would have no unnecessary costs. (Do you have the skills to uncover the hidden or camouflaged costs? Do not worry, it is easy to learn how to uncover every cost that your plan has.) 
# The plan would require minimal time to manage and monitor. If you make your plan simple, which means it has up to eight index funds and a TPA (Third Party Administrator), the named fiduciary can save time in managing and monitoring the plan.

If you plan to buy jewelry, you need to know about the fineness of gold:

# 14kt = 58.33% pure. 
# 10kt = 41.67% pure. 

If you plan to set up a 401(k) or 403(b) plan, you need to complete the '''Five Simple Steps''' for setting up, managing, and monitoring a plan:
 
'''Step 1''': Draft a mission statement for your plan. A leader decides on the mission and how the mission will be accomplished, right?&lt;br&gt;
'''Step 2:''' Select the plan’s investments.&lt;br&gt;
'''Step 3:''' Hire the plan’s vendors.&lt;br&gt;
'''Step 4:''' Manage your plan.&lt;br&gt;
'''Step 5:''' Monitor your plan.&lt;br&gt;
|source    = 
}}
'''Step 1:''' First, draft a mission statement for your plan. A leader decides on the mission and how the mission will be accomplished, right? As the employer, you could adopt the following mission statement: 
{{blockquote|Our mission is to select a core mix of no-load, [[Mutual funds and fees |low-cost]] index funds because index funds are designed to match the market’s performance (less their cost). This will allow employees (participants) to choose their mix of investments from the mix of index funds. We will set up a self-directed account for each employee who thinks that they can pick funds that will beat the performance of index funds. Next, we will pay no more than the current benchmark for the necessary record keeping and administration. We will not pay any asset-based fees for services such as consulting, investment advice, education, or administration. We will draft a plan document that is compatible with our mission statement, and we will draft a summary plan description.}}
 
'''Step 2:''' Select the plan’s investments. Your plan’s [[Investment policy statement |investment policy statement (IPS)]] will specify which index funds to pick for the plan. It will also specify why you picked index funds and how you will monitor them. In the IPS you must also explain why you decided not to use managed funds, and/or asset-allocation, [[Target date retirement funds |target-date]], life-cycle, lifestyle, and [[Balanced fund|balanced funds]]–if you have decided against them. No one will file a legal action against you for not trying to pick funds that will beat index funds (the market) in performance. The IPS will also describe how you will set up the self-directed accounts for employees.
 
'''Step 3:''' Hire the plan’s vendors. Using your mission statement’s guidelines, hire vendors and ensure that they are not paid more than the current benchmark of $30 per eligible employee per year for record keeping and administration. Do not pay any asset-based fees for services such as consulting, investment advice, or employee education.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Plan administrators typically have a minimum yearly fee. The current cost leaders are Employee Fiduciary ($1500/yr + .08% AUM) and Guideline ($480/yr). Source: {{Forum post|p=4602094|title=Re: Setting up a 401(K) plan|author=Lee_WSP|date = June 19, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
'''Step 4:''' Manage your plan. Guided by your mission statement, so that it has truly low-cost services and a mix of investments that will match the market’s performance.
 
'''Step 5:''' Monitor your plan. Each month, use the guidelines in your mission statement to ensure that you have accomplished your mission of setting up an optimal 401(k) plan. 

In addition to your mission statement, plan document, and summary plan description, you need a provider policy statement (PPS), which is composed of the following documents:
 
*Mission statement (MS).
*Investment policy statement (IPS): guidelines for choosing the plan’s investments and monitoring them. 
*Vendor policy statement (VPS): guidelines that will ensure that only vendors who can assist you in making your plan truly optimal are hired. 
*Education policy statement (EPS): guidelines for a program that educates employees about 401(k) plans and trains every employee to be part of an effective system of checks and balances. 
*Communications Policy Statement (CPS): guidelines for a communications program that ensures employees are informed so that they are part of an effective system of checks and balances. 
*Monitoring policy statement (MPS): guidelines for monitoring the plan’s vendors, investments, and education and communication programs. 

'''Keep it simple'''; your guidelines should not be more than a few sentences. You may find it handy to use a three-ring binder for your PPS documents. 

'''If you complete this proven process, both you and your employees will reap the benefits.''' 

'''Employer benefits:''' 
*The named fiduciary will save time because a plan that is optimal requires less time to manage and monitor. 
*Your company will save money on the plan’s cost. 
*Employees will not spend excessive time while at work trying to figure how the plan works, how to select their mix of investments, and how to monitor their investments.

'''Employee benefits:''' 
*Employees will not need to spend countless hours trying to figure how the plan works, how to select their mix of investments, and how to monitor their investments. 
*Employees will save money on the plan’s cost. 
*Employees will save money on the cost of their investments.

'''Revenue sharing:'''
*Revenue sharing is money that plan providers receive from many of the 401(k) plan's mutual funds. Typically, the Third Party Administrator (TPA) will decide how the fees that are paid to them by the mutual funds will be used. For instance, the TPA can decide to give certain fees back to the plan's participants who the fees. Or the TPA can use the fees to help lower the cost that the employer pays for the 401(k) plan. Fiduciaries should consider the consequences of failing to disclose how revenue sharing is used. Therefore, it would be a mistake not to ask for a revenue sharing table that shows which funds have revenue sharing and how those fees are being used.

You are learning  how to complete all five steps FAST, right here! Remember, it is critical to complete the steps in the right order. It would be a mistake to complete step three before you complete steps one and two.

==Request for proposal (RFP)==
Put together a list of low cost 401(k) Plan service providers (recordkeepers and administrators) who will include a menu of index funds in your plan: 
'''Example:''' *[http://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=81170 Who else wants to know how to lobby for a lower cost 401(k)]
Ask two or more service providers to compare the cost of your plan to the plan that their firm offers.
If you are an employer, before you send out an RFP it behooves you to know what a truly low cost 401(k) plan looks like. It would be a mistake if you are thinking this: "I'll know it when I see it." That mindset is how employers do the wrong thing and set up a 401(k) or 403(b) plan that costs more than it should. The point is this: if you believe that you will know which plan is a "good one" when you see it, you are fooling yourself; instead, the first step is to learn what a truly low cost and optimal plan really looks like. Otherwise, if you just set out to meet with one service provider after another, instead of setting up an optimal 401(k) or 403(b) plan, you will likely waste your time in meetings with the service providers who have a history of setting up plans that create the illusion that the plan they recommend is low cost and optimal. 

Your job as a fiduciary is to hire service providers who can help you set up a truly low cost plan. A low cost plan looks like this:
 
*Its menu of investments has a core mix of low cost index funds.
*Its recordkeeping and administration costs not more than $30.00, per year, per eligible employee with no hidden or camouflaged costs. 

Got it? Okay, now we can look at an overview of how you can request a formal proposal from a service provider--FAST. Remember, the idea is to keep your initial contact simple. First, here are some common mistakes that employers make. 

'''Request For Proposal (RFP) - Four Common Mistakes'''
# Not knowing what a truly low cost 401(k) or 403(b) plan looks like before you request a proposal from a few vendors.
# Not uncovering all of the conflicts of interest and believing that you are too smart for conflicts of interest to hurt YOUR bottom line. 
# Believing a service provider's sales pitch that IF you hire a competitor who has the lowest cost you are being shortsighted. 
# Failure to understand your fiduciary duties. (Have you, the named fiduciary, been acting in the company's best interests, not the best interests of the participants?) 

'''Below is a Sample RFP.''' On your company's letterhead, you can draft the following letter:

{| class="wikitable"
|+ Sample RFP
|-
|
*Name and phone number of contact person at your company and if your plan is a 401(k) or a 403(b). 
*Basic information about your plan such as how many employees are eligible and how many participate.
*Ask questions that you want the service provider to answer such as...
**Will we have access to Vanguard and/or Fidelity index funds? Which funds are they? 
**Are there other brokerage firms or mutual funds that we could use in our plan?
**Where will our plan's assets be held? at a Bank Trust department? at a Brokerage firm? How much will the custodian charge us? Send us a sample of the reports that the custodian provides us with.
**Is there a termination fee?
**How much will you charge us to set the plan up?
**How much is the cost per eligible participant?''' 
**Do you offer assistance in designing and drafting the Plan Document and Summary Plan Description?
**If a few participants want to use a self-directed brokerage account, how much will it cost them to set up? How much will they pay per trade? 
**Are there any other costs involved such as a termination fee, moving assets from old plan to new plan, switching one mutual fund to another, loans, rollover to an IRA, distribution fees, or amending the plan? 

'''How will you enroll the participants?'''
* Will you mail materials to participants' home addresses?
* Do you automatically enroll eligible employees?
* Do you have automatic annual increases in the participants' contributions?
* Can you set up the participants' asset allocation and rebalancing on auto-pilot?
* Do you educate employees about the plan and its investments?
* Do you do initial enrollment meetings? 

'''Close your letter by saying something like this:''' 

Please send us a sample of a participant statement as well as a sample of the management reports that you prepare for us to use in reviewing our plan. Also, where can we see the tools you provide for the participants? And is there a minimum length of time that we are required to stay with your company for recordkeeping and administration?

'''Summary:''' 
First, select the plan’s investments. Then, hire the plan’s vendors, and educate your employees about the plan and its investments. You can watch a five minute video to see why it is important to complete the Five Simple Steps in the right order: [http://www.youtube.com/user/frankcirullo?feature=fupldc#p/a/u/2/ak8qJEaIWh0 Youtube: Five Simple Steps]

Employees, if you have an employer who has refused to improve your 401(k) or 403(b) plan by taking the steps that we discussed here, do not worry. There is still hope that one day you will have a plan that has truly low cost recordkeeping and administration and a mix of investments that will at least match the market's performance--long term. But you will have to change the plan from the ground up by talking with other employees. Just ask them to read this. Just think about it. Regarding investments, is it smarter to be guaranteed to match the market's performance by owning a diversified mix of index funds or to risk underperforming it by investing in managed mutual funds and packaged products such as target-date funds? Is the answer not obvious, yet?

==Education==
'''Education is the key.'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=[[Julie R. Agnew|Agnew, Julie R.]]|author2=Szykman, Lisa R.|date=2005|title=Asset allocation and information overload: The influence of information display, asset choice, and investor experience|url=https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&amp;hl=en&amp;user=r8tC4LwAAAAJ&amp;citation_for_view=r8tC4LwAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC|location=The Journal of Behavioral Finance|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.|pages=57-70}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example:
 
*A fiduciary can manage his risk by selecting a core mix of index funds. Index funds are much easier to select and monitor than managed mutual funds and packaged products such as target-date funds. 
*No one will sue the fiduciary and take him to court for not trying to beat the market by selecting managed mutual funds and packaged products such as asset-allocation, target-date, lifestyle, lifecycle, and balanced funds. Especially when not one expert has ever picked a mix of managed mutual funds and/or packaged products that beat a core mix of index funds in performance--long term. 
*Employers must educate employees by explaining to them exactly what we are discussing in this article.   If that fails to convince someone that it is better to match the market with index funds rather than risk underperforming it long term and a few employees still want to try their hand at picking managed mutual funds anyway, let them knock themselves out in a Self-directed Brokerage Account. Sooner or later, they will get it and invest in index funds. 
*The employer is responsible for setting up a low cost self-directed Brokerage Account for employees who want to use it. Then, the employer must monitor its cost to ensure that it is low. Also, restrictions can be placed on which mutual funds cannot be included in the universe of funds that will be available in the Self-directed Brokerage Account.

==Communication==

# The plan consultant and investment adviser believe that managed mutual funds are the way to invest.

How employers and employees communicate with each other matters to the success of your 401(k) or 403(b) plan. And how families communicate with each other to successfully manage the family money is not that different. Regarding communication between employers and employees, the idea is to get everyone at your company on the same page pulling the wagon (401k plan) in the same direction. 

Here is how employers and employees can hear each other out and communicate effectively with each other: 

'''Step 1.''' Investments are the most important part of a retirement plan. So, you can pick a core mix of investments for the plan's menu by asking each other these questions... 

*Which large-cap blend index fund do you like best? Why?
*Which mid-cap blend index fund do you like best? Why?
*Which small-cap blend index fund do you like best? Why?
*Which foreign large-cap blend index fund do you like best? Why?
*Which short-term bond fund do you like best? Why?
*Which intermediate-term bond fund do you like best? Why?
*Which long-term bond fund do you like best? Why?

'''Step 2:''' Ask each other this question: Which recordkeeper and administrator do you like best? Why? How much do they charge per year, per eligible employee? How do you know that they provide timely and accurate statements? 
{|style="border:1px solid #729fcf;background:WhiteSmoke;"
||
'''Note:''' The cost of your plan matters. There is no good reason to pay more than $30.00, per year, per eligible employee, which includes all of the bells and whistles that your plan needs.
|}

==Tips==
'''Tip 1:''' To learn why it is critical to do the '''Five Simple Steps''' in the right order, watch this five minute video: (The reason that employers go down the wrong path and set up a plan that costs more than it should is because they complete step three before they complete steps one and two.) Here is the link to the video: [http://www.youtube.com/user/frankcirullo?feature=fupldc#p/a/u/2/ak8qJEaIWh0  Youtube: Five Simple Steps]

''A free gift:'' It is a pyramid that will remind you of five steps that, if taken, cannot fail to cut your plan's cost and improve its investment performance. Keep the pyramid on your desktop. To download your gift, Click on one of the two links below: 

*If you have a 401(k) Plan, click here: [http://www.401kplanschool.com/documents/401k_pyramid.pdf 401(k) pyramid] 
*If you have a 403(b) Plan, click Here: [http://www.403bplanschool.com/documents/403b_pyramid.pdf 403(b) pyramid]

This three inch tall pyramid will serve you well day-after-day, because when you combine the five easy steps written on it with what you have learned in this article, you will have a blueprint that you can use to manage and monitor your plan to ensure that it is truly low cost.

'''Tip 2:''' Success breeds success. Get a buddy to talk to so that you can encourage each other to ignore the noise that almost always guides people into awful investments that lead you down the wrong path to retirement. 

'''Tip 3:''' Below are a few of the choices that you have: 

*Top-down change is quick: If the named fiduciary and other decision makers have shown that they are willing hear you out, you can have them request a formal proposal, which would include a comparison between the plan you have and a lower cost plan that you could have--FAST. 
*Bottom-up change is slow: If the decision makers will not hear you out, you can encourage other employees to complain about the plan's cost by signing a letter that requests switching to a truly low cost plan. 
*Do both of the above. 

If you have put together a plan of action, please post your plan in the forum because it may very well help others who are tired of paying more than they should for:

*Services
*A menu of investments that underperform truly low cost index funds

'''Tip 4:''' If your company does not want to switch to a lower cost plan because of surrender charges on the investments or a termination fee to terminate the plan, you can do the following: You can freeze the old plan and transfer money to the new plan as the surrender charges go away, which may be over a period of years. Also, you can avoid the termination fee that way. The new TPA will complete this process of transferring money to the new plan as appropriate. Or it may be in the best interests of your company to pay any surrender charges and the termination fee, now. Remember, it was your company that made a poor decision and created the mess.

'''Tip 5:''' When you read this article (which is about How to set up a low cost 401(k) or 403(b) FAST) you will only take in what you are already familiar with. And those ideas that may be new to you will require reading more than once. But each time you read it you will get great tips that are proven to work and that you can use today--right now. Yes, a proven idea that may seem difficult for you to understand really will become clearer and clearer each time you read it. 

'''Tip 6:''' What you are up against is dysfunctional buying practices--not one decision maker at your company seems to be willing to consider the possibility that the company's plan costs more than it should. And not one of them wants to hear you out. For instance, your employer may tell you something like this just to put you off:  

{{blockquote|'''Fiduciary:''' "We evaluate our plan every year." &lt;br&gt;

'''You:''' "Really? May I attend your next meeting? I'd like to show you what's wrong with our plan as well as some easy and fast ways to improve it. I will get together with you prior to the meeting. That way you can see that these ideas really do work, as promised. By the way, the main reason why we should implement these proven ideas is because they will result in saving time and money for the employees as well as the organization--the results will be immediate. By attending a meeting with the committee, I can answer any questions that they may have."}}
  
'''Note to employees:''' Remember, a decision maker who sets up a plan that costs more than it should has proved that they do not know what a low cost plan looks like. You are there to help the employer because it is YOUR retirement money that is in the plan. The employer must always act in the participants' best interests, not the employer's. See? Look at it this way. If an employer (plan sponsor) does not know what a low cost plan really looks like, it is because they do not know how to evaluate the plan's service providers and investments, which can get the company into a lot of trouble as a fiduciary. It is also a big waste of the committee's time to go through the motions of looking like they are doing a real review.

U.S. regulations permit "in service" tax free transfer of certain accounts, under specific circumstances. These types of transfers may be useful if you hold SIMPLE IRA accounts or deferred variable annuities. Under some circumstances, if you have a 403(b) plan you may also be able to transfer accounts while still working for your employer. To remain tax deferred, these transfers are all trustee-to-trustee exchanges between the companies providing the accounts.

==SIMPLE IRA transfers==
{{main|SIMPLE IRA}}

Although SIMPLE IRAs are a small part of the employer-provided qualified plan universe, they are the only plan that currently let you exchange in-service trustee-to-trustee, to a provider you choose. The first consideration when choosing a SIMPLE-IRA provider is to determine the type of SIMPLE IRA your employer has established, either an [http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f5304sim.pdf IRS Form 5304-SIMPLE] or an [http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f5305sim.pdf IRS Form 5305-SIMPLE].

* '''IRS Form 5304-SIMPLE''': this and similar forms of a SIMPLE IRA let you choose the financial institution for receiving contributions. The employer is required to send contributions on your behalf directly to your chosen financial institution. Most participants are unaware of this option, so you need to check with your employer to see what form was used to create the plan. Obviously, if you have this type of SIMPLE-IRA you can choose a low cost provider, and then invest all your salary deferral and employer match in low cost funds.
* '''IRS Form 5305-SIMPLE''': this and similar forms of SIMPLE IRA require all contributions to be deposited initially at your designated chosen financial institution. You must transfer trustee-to-trustee to invest with your chosen provider. During the first two years of participating in a SIMPLE IRA, you can only transfer to another SIMPLE IRA. After two years (dated from the first contribution into the plan) you can transfer into a Traditional IRA.

With Form 5305-SIMPLE IRAs you should always try to reduce transfer costs by choosing the lowest cost fund in your employer's plan for accumulating assets for transfer. For load fund SIMPLE IRAs this is usually restricted to a no-load share class of a money market fund. Because your on-going salary deferrals and employer matches will be deposited with the employer's provider, avoiding front end loads and back end surrender charges is essential in reducing transfer costs.

==403(b) transfers==
{{main|403(b)}}

Before September 24, 2007, if you held a high-cost 403(b) plans you could take advantage of the 90-24 Transfer provision of the IRS code and transfer plan assets in-service trustee-to-trustee to your chosen outside provider. The finalized IRS 403(b) regulations, operational after January 1, 2009, have terminated the 90-24 provision. However, under the current interpretation of the new regulations,&lt;ref&gt; [http://m.403bwise.com/wisemoves/newtransferrules.html New transfer rules],{{broken link}} 403(b)wise.com.&lt;/ref&gt; in-service trustee-to-trustee transfers may still be possible if certain conditions are met. 403(b) investors can move to low-cost providers in two ways under the new regulations:

* The employer may select a low cost provider as an option within the plan;
* The employer may permit exchanges and establish a formal information sharing relationship with an outside low cost provider.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The IRS allows 403(b) contract exchanges with a non-payroll slot vendor if:
*the plan permits the exchange;
*the accumulated benefit after the exchange is at least the same as before the exchange;
*the employer and the non-payroll slot vendor agree to share information regarding employment and the plan’s terms;
*any pre-exchange benefit restrictions are maintained after the exchange; and
*the vendor complies with the plan’s terms.  See [https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/retirement-plans-faqs-regarding-403b-tax-sheltered-annuity-plans#15 What are the rules on in-service transfers or exchanges], IRS FAQs regarding 403(b) Tax Sheltered Annuity Plans.&lt;/ref&gt; 

If Vanguard's information sharing document is not accepted by the employer, it is possible that the documents from [[Fidelity]], [[T. Rowe Price]], or [[TIAA-CREF]] may be accepted, so that you can transfer to a 403(b)(7)&lt;ref group="note"&gt; A 403(b)(7) designation refers to a 403(b) plan that is funded by investments in mutual funds.&lt;/ref&gt; portfolio available from these providers.

If you are thinking of doing this, try to minimize your transfer costs by choosing an employer plan investment option that is exempt from front or back end loads, or stiff annuity surrender fees. Many current 403(b) investors will be subject to these surrender fees; something to consider when assessing the feasibility of an exchange.

==1035 exchanges of non-qualifying variable annuities==
{{main|Variable Annuity}}

Because variable annuities typically have high insurance costs and stiff back end surrender fees, a tax-free exchange of high cost contracts to a no-load, no surrender fee, low cost variable annuity is clearly useful for most non-qualifying annuities. This type of transfer is known as a 1035 transfer&lt;ref group="note"&gt; See [http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec1035ex.asp 1035 transfer], Investopedia. The 1035 exchange also applies to transfers of fixed deferred annuities and cash value life insurance contracts.&lt;/ref&gt; The annuity option variables to include in a calculation are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://ssrn.com/abstract=496025| title=Exchanging Variable Annuities: An Optional Test for Suitability| author1=Moshe A. Milevsky| author2=Kamphol Panyagometh| date=2004| accessdate=June 27, 2025}} Available from SSRN.&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Lapse value'''. This captures the cash-flow that comes from liquidating or surrendering the policy – possibly after paying a contingent deferred surrender charge (CDSC) – and is tied to the evolution of the market value of the sub-accounts. Most investors purchase VAs exclusively for their lapse value since they view the instrument as a (tax-preferred) savings vehicle. Therefore, when contemplating an exchange, be aware of the discounted lapse value (DLV) of the new policy. All else being equal, the greater the contingent deferred surrender charges (CDSC) on the new policy and/or the greater the Mortality and Expense Risk Fees (from here, abbreviated M&amp;E Fee) relative to the old policy, the lower the discounted lapse value, and the less likely it is that an exchange will be beneficial.
* '''Death value'''. Most VA policies contain some form of guaranteed minimum death benefit. This guarantee comes in various shapes and flavors, but usually consists of a return-of-premium guarantee together with a minimally guaranteed interest rate and/or anniversary step-up feature, which periodically raises the minimum guarantee to market value. And, while these guaranteed minimum death benefits (GMDB) (as they are collectively known) have become a recent nuisance to the risk management and treasury departments within the insurance companies issuing these policies, most consumers are more likely to lapse their VA than die and cash-in on the GMDB. Nevertheless, this embedded option must be priced in any transaction; the term discounted mortality value (DMV) denotes the current value of this guarantee.
* '''Guaranteed Annuity Rates'''. All variable annuity policies contain an option to annuitize – in the form of a guaranteed mortality table and interest rate – which is poorly understood and usually ignored. Many older VAs contain annuity rate guarantees that are linked to outdated mortality tables and so are more valuable, relative to updated mortality tables that assume a longer life expectancy. More recent VA policies offer optional guaranteed minimum income benefit (GMIB) riders which are a form of guaranteed annuity rate. In general, the term discounted annuity value (DAV) denotes the collection of options associated with the ability to annuitize the policy at a pre-specified mortality table and interest rate.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' describes retirement plans offered by employers. For individual retirement plans, see [[:Category:Retirement planning | Retirement planning]]. US government employees should see [[Thrift Savings Plan]].

==Employer retirement plan defined==
A pension plan is an employee benefit plan established or maintained by an employer or by an employee organization (such as a union), or both, that provides retirement income or [[Deferred compensation | defers income]] until termination of covered employment or beyond. There are a number of types of retirement plans, including the [[401(k) | 401(k) plan]] and the traditional pension plan, known as a [[Defined benefit pension plan | defined benefit plan]].

Most private sector pension plans are covered by the [[Employee Retirement Income Security Act]] (ERISA). Among other things, ERISA provides protections for participants and beneficiaries in employee benefit plans, including providing access to plan information. Also, those individuals who manage plans (and other fiduciaries) must meet certain standards of conduct under the fiduciary responsibilities specified in the law.&lt;ref name="DOL"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ebsa/about-ebsa/our-activities/resource-center/publications/meeting-your-fiduciary-responsibilities| title=Meeting Your Fiduciary Responsibilities| publisher=US Department of Labor| accessdate=October 18, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Implementing an employer retirement plan requires consideration of many factors that affect both the employer and employee. Plan complexity is demonstrated by the fact that the IRS maintains a web site dedicated to nothing more than [https://www.irs.gov/Retirement-Plans/Correcting-Plan-Errors correcting retirement plans].

===Qualified retirement plan===
A [[Qualified retirement plan | qualified retirement plan]] meets the requirements of Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a) and the [[Employee Retirement Income Security Act]] and therefore qualifies for favorable tax treatment. Contributions and earnings are tax-deferred until withdrawn. 

The Employee Retirement Income Security Act covers two types of pension plans: [[#Defined benefit plan (qualified) | defined benefit plans]] and [[#Defined contribution plan (qualified)| defined contribution plans]].&lt;ref name = "DOL" /&gt;

==IRA-based plans (qualified)==
[[Traditional IRA | IRAs]] are not limited to individuals. An employer can help its employees set up and fund their IRAs. With an IRA, the amount that you receive at retirement depends on the funding of the IRA and the earnings (or losses) on those funds.

===Payroll deduction IRA===
(Employer perspective) This is probably the simplest retirement arrangement that a business can have. It is so easy that, in fact, no plan document is needed under this arrangement.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The payroll deduction IRA is uncommon.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under a Payroll Deduction IRA, an employee establishes an IRA (either a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA) with a financial institution. The employee then authorizes a payroll deduction amount for the IRA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/plan-sponsor/payroll-deduction-ira| title=Payroll deduction IRA| publisher=IRS| accessdate=October 18, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===SARSEP===
{{Main|SARSEP}}
(Employer perspective) A [[Salary Reduction Simplified Employee Pension Plan]] (SARSEP) is a [[SEP | Simplified Employee Pension]] (SEP) plan set up before 1997 that permits contributions to be made through employee salary reductions, referred to as "employee elective deferrals." Under a SARSEP, employees and employers make contributions to traditional Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs) set up for the employees, subject to certain percentage-of-pay and dollar limits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/retirement-plans-faqs-regarding-sarseps| title=Retirement plans FAQs regarding SARSEPs| publisher=IRS| accessdate=October 18, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Employees can play an active role in funding for their retirement by choosing to have the employer contribute part of their pay to their separate IRAs, referred to as SEP-IRAs. SEP-IRAs need to be established for each participant, even those becoming eligible after December 31, 1996, with a bank, insurance company or other qualified financial institution.

No new SARSEPs can be established after December 31, 1996. However, employers who established SARSEPs prior to January 1, 1997, can continue to maintain them and new employees of the employers hired after December 31, 1996, can participate in the existing SARSEP.

===SEP===
{{Main|SEP}}
(Employer perspective) A [[SEP]] is a Simplified Employee Pension plan. Because this is a simplified plan, the administrative costs should be lower than for other, more complex plans. Under a SEP, employers make contributions to traditional Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs) set up for employees (including self –employed individuals), subject to certain limits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/plan-sponsor/simplified-employee-pension-plan-sep| title=Simplified Employee Pension plan (SEP)| publisher=IRS| accessdate=October 18, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because this is a simplified plan, the administrative costs should be lower than for other, more complex plans. Under a SIMPLE IRA plan, employees and employers make contributions to traditional Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs) set up for employees (including self-employed individuals), subject to certain limits. It is ideally suited as a start-up retirement savings plan for small employers who do not currently sponsor a retirement plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/plan-sponsor/simple-ira-plan| title=SIMPLE IRA plan| publisher=IRS| accessdate=October 18, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Defined benefit plan (qualified)==
{{Main| Defined benefit pension plan}}
A ''defined benefit pension plan'' is the most administratively complex type of retirement plan. Businesses of any size may use it. Employers can generally contribute more to a defined benefit plan than to other types of retirement plans.

This fund is different from many pension funds where payouts are somewhat dependent on the return of the invested funds. Therefore, employers will need to dip into the companies earnings in the event that the returns from the investments devoted to funding the employee's retirement result in a funding shortfall. The payouts made to retiring employees participating in defined-benefit plans are determined by more personalized factors, like length of employment.

The most common type of monthly benefit is predetermined by a formula based on the employee's earnings history, tenure of service and age, rather than depending on investment returns. It is 'defined' in the sense that the formula for computing the employer's contribution is known in advance.

In a Defined Benefit plan, more precision ("definition") occurs for the plan's output, that is, the "benefit." Less precision is available to the employer concerning the input, that is, the "contribution." If plan investments lose money, employer is on the hook to restore the trust to the amount that is actuarially needed to be on track to fund the stated benefit.&lt;ref name="mah001"&gt;{{forum link| p=2171995| title=Re: Wiki revised - Employer Retirement Plan Overview| author=mah001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, a Defined Contribution plan ([[#Defined contribution plan (qualified)| below]]) gives employer more control over what goes in, and what comes out ("benefit") is more a function of investment performance.

===Traditional pension===
A [[Defined benefit pension plan | defined benefit pension plan]] promises a specified monthly benefit at retirement. The plan may state this promised benefit as an exact dollar amount, such as $100 per month at retirement. Or, more commonly, it may calculate a benefit through a plan formula that considers such factors as salary and service — for example, 1% of pay per year of service x avg salary for the 5 highest years, as of plan's normal retirement age.&lt;ref name="mah001" /&gt;

The benefits in most traditional defined benefit plans are protected, within certain limitations, by federal insurance provided through the [https://www.pbgc.gov/ Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation] (PBGC).&lt;ref name = "DOL"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cash balance plan===
A cash balance plan is a defined benefit plan that defines the benefit in terms that are more characteristic of a defined contribution plan. In other words, a cash balance plan defines the promised benefit in terms of a stated account balance. In a typical cash balance plan, a participant's account is credited each year with a "pay credit" (such as 5 percent of compensation from their employer) and an "interest credit" (either a fixed rate or a variable rate that is linked to an index such as the one-year treasury bill rate). Increases and decreases in the value of the plan's investments do not directly affect the benefit amounts promised to participants. Thus, the investment risks and rewards on plan assets are borne solely by the employer. When a participant becomes entitled to receive benefits under a cash balance plan, the benefits that are received are defined in terms of an account balance. The benefits in most cash balance plans, as in most traditional defined benefit plans, are protected, within certain limitations, by federal insurance provided through the [https://www.pbgc.gov/ Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC)].&lt;ref name = "DOL"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Defined contribution plan (qualified)==
A defined contribution plan, on the other hand, does not promise a specific amount of benefits at retirement. In these plans, the employee or the employer (or both) contribute to the employee's individual account under the plan, sometimes at a set rate, such as 5 percent of earnings annually. These contributions generally are invested on the employee's behalf. The employee will ultimately receive the balance in their account, which is based on contributions plus or minus investment gains or losses. The value of the account will fluctuate due to the changes in the value of the investments. Examples of defined contribution plans include [[401(k) | 401(k) plans]], [[403(b) | 403(b) plans]], employee stock ownership plans, and profit-sharing plans.

2. This because employer can deduct this as wages/salaries. Employee can get deferral of tax to a later date.&lt;ref name="mah001" /&gt;&lt;br&gt;
3. In truth employers do not always cover everyone. While the above described employees must be considered under the coverage rules, the rules do not then require 100% coverage or participation. note that very large employers may have many plans, each covering a narrowly defined subset of the company's employees.&lt;ref name="mah001" /&gt;
|}

===Profit sharing===
A profit sharing plan or stock bonus plan is a defined contribution plan under which the plan may provide, or the employer may determine, annually, how much will be contributed to the plan (out of profits or otherwise). The plan contains a formula for allocating to each participant a portion of each annual contribution. A profit sharing plan or stock bonus plan can include a 401(k) plan.&lt;ref name = "DOL" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/choosing-a-retirement-plan-profit-sharing-plan| title=Choosing a retirement plan: Profit sharing plan | publisher=IRS| accessdate=October 18, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Safe harbor 401(k)s===
A safe harbor 401(k) plan is similar to a traditional 401(k) plan, but, among other things, it must provide for employer contributions that are fully vested when made. These contributions may be employer matching contributions, limited to employees who defer, or employer contributions made on behalf of all eligible employees, regardless of whether they make elective deferrals. The safe harbor 401(k) plan is not subject to the complex annual nondiscrimination tests that apply to traditional 401(k) plans.

===401(k) plans defined===
{{Main|401(k)}}
A 401(k) plan is a qualified (that is, meets the standards set forth in the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) for tax-favored status) profit-sharing, stock bonus, pre-ERISA money purchase pension, or a rural cooperative plan under which an employee can elect to have the employer contribute a portion of the employee’s cash wages to the plan on a pre-tax basis. These deferred wages (elective deferrals) are not subject to federal income tax withholding at the time of deferral, and they are not reflected as taxable income on the employee’s Form 1040, U.S. Individual Income Tax Return.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/401k-plans| title=401(k) plans| publisher=IRS| accessdate=October 18, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Employees who would like to change their employer's 401(k) plan should refer to [[How to Campaign for a Better 401(k) Plan]].

===Traditional 401(k)===
{{Main|401(k)}}
A traditional 401(k) plan allows eligible employees (that is, employees eligible to participate in the plan) to make pre-tax elective deferrals through payroll deductions. In addition, in a traditional 401(k) plan, employers have the option of making contributions on behalf of all participants, making matching contributions based on employees' elective deferrals, or both. These employer contributions can be subject to a vesting schedule which provides that an employee’s right to employer contributions becomes nonforfeitable only after a period of time, or be immediately vested.

''Designated Roth accounts in 401(k) plans'': Beginning in 2006, a [[401(k) | 401(k)]] plan (but not a SARSEP or SIMPLE IRA plan) may permit an employee to irrevocably designate some or all of their elective contributions under the plan as designated Roth contributions. The plan must contain language that allows for these Roth contributions.

A designated Roth account is a separate account under a 401(k)plan to which designated Roth contributions are made, and for which separate accounting of contributions, gains, and losses is maintained.&lt;ref name="designated"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/plan-participant-employee/retirement-topics-designated-roth-account| title=Retirement topics - Designated Roth account| publisher=IRS| accessdate=October 18, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Money purchase plan===
A money purchase pension plan is a plan that requires fixed annual contributions from the employer to the employee's individual account. Because a money purchase pension plan requires these regular contributions, the plan is subject to certain funding and other rules.&lt;ref name = "DOL"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note" name="mah001"&gt;Money Purchase and Target Benefit plans are rarely found. A Money Purchase Plan especially is a dinosaur after law changes in late 1990s made it superfluous and potentially unbeneficial for a business.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/choosing-a-retirement-plan-money-purchase-plan| title=Choosing a retirement plan: Money purchase plan| publisher=IRS| accessdate=October 18, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===SIMPLE 401(k)===
The SIMPLE 401(k) (&lt;u&gt;S&lt;/u&gt;avings &lt;u&gt;I&lt;/u&gt;ncentive &lt;u&gt;M&lt;/u&gt;atch &lt;u&gt;PL&lt;/u&gt;an for &lt;u&gt;E&lt;/u&gt;mployees) plan was created so that small businesses could have an effective, cost-efficient way to offer retirement benefits to their employees. A SIMPLE 401(k) plan is not subject to the annual nondiscrimination tests that apply to traditional 401(k) plans. As with a safe harbor 401(k) plan, the employer is required to make employer contributions that are fully vested. This type of 401(k) plan is available to employers with 100 or fewer employees who received at least $5,000 in compensation from the employer for the preceding calendar year. Employees who are eligible to participate in a SIMPLE 401(k) plan may not receive any contributions or benefit accruals under any other plans of the employer.

===Target benefit plan===
{{see also|wikipedia:Target benefit plan}}
A target benefit plan is a type of pension plan that contains features of a defined contribution plan but is made to appear like a defined benefit plan.&lt;ref group="note" name="mah001" /&gt;

It is similar to defined benefit plan in that the annual contribution is determined by a formula to calculate the amount needed each year to accumulate (at an assumed interest rate) a fund sufficient to pay a projected retirement benefit, the target benefit, to each participant upon reaching retirement. It is similar to a defined contribution plan in that the plan does not guarantee any benefit will be paid. The plan's only obligation is to pay whatever benefit can be provided by the amount in the contributor’s account. The actual earnings on the individual accounts may differ from the estimated earnings used in the assumptions and the investment performance of that account through the years.

==Keogh plan (qualified)==
{{Main|Keogh plan}}
A qualified retirement plan that may either be a defined benefit plan or a defined contribution plan. A Keogh plan is intended for self-employed individuals and partnerships. If you are a sole proprietor, consider the [[Solo 401k plan| Solo 401(k)]] plan.&lt;ref name="solo"&gt;{{forum link| t=17637| title=Solo 401(k) Plan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;A Keogh plan has little significance any more; other than in the calculation of "compensation."&lt;/ref&gt;

2. '''Other''' - Generally, the plan's assets are held in a tax-exempt trust, though they can also be held in custodial accounts and annuity contracts.&lt;br&gt;
3. All Dollar limits are for 2025 and subject to cost-of-living adjustments in future years (except the age 50&lt;nowiki&gt;+&lt;/nowiki&gt; catch-up contributions for Payroll Deduction IRAs).&lt;br&gt;

7. Hardship, if offered in a 457, is called an "unforseen emergency."&lt;ref name="mah001" /&gt;&lt;br&gt;
8. This is true for more of these plans recently. See Form 5500 instructions for exceptions to the filing requirement. Governmental and church sponsors are exempt from ERISA, so many don't file. Other employers who are passive enough in their plan sponsorship (such as by not making any employer contributions) may also be exempt from the filing requirement.&lt;ref name="mah001" /&gt;&lt;br&gt;
9. Governments may not be completely exempt from coverage/nondiscrimination. See, for example, the 403(b) universal availability rule, in the 1.403(b) regs.&lt;ref name="mah001" /&gt;

===403(b) tax sheltered annuity===
{{Main|403(b)}}
A 403(b) tax-sheltered annuity (TSA) plan is a retirement plan offered by public schools and certain tax-exempt organizations. An individual’s 403(b) annuity can be obtained only under an employer's TSA plan. Generally, these annuities are funded by elective deferrals made under salary reduction agreements and nonelective employer contributions. See: [https://www.irs.gov/publications/p571/index.html Publication 571, Tax-Sheltered Annuity Plans (403(b) Plans)], from the IRS.

''Designated Roth accounts in 403(b) plans'': Beginning in 2006, [[403(b) | 403(b)]] plan (but not a SARSEP or SIMPLE IRA plan) may permit an employee to irrevocably designate some or all of their elective contributions under the plan as designated Roth contributions. The plan must contain language that allows for these Roth contributions.

A designated Roth account is a separate account under a 403(b) plan to which designated Roth contributions are made, and for which separate accounting of contributions, gains, and losses is maintained.&lt;ref name="designated" /&gt;

===457(b) deferred compensation plan===
{{Main|457(b)}}
{{See also |Links to 457(b) plans}}
{{:457(b)}} &lt;!-- use the wiki, changes will be reflected here --&gt;
*Please see the 457(b) wiki article for the plan details, e.g. combining with other qualified plans, no 10% early withdrawal penalty if..., special 'catch-up' provisions if...

====457(b) additional information====
*State and local government plans fall into the "non-qualified" category because they do not pay tax.&lt;ref&gt;{{forum link| p=557717| title=Employer Retirement Plans - Is this OK?]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Government 457(b) plans MUST be funded, as indicated above because the vested account balances are being held "for the exclusive future benefit of the employee". This is the definition of the doctrine of "economic benefit", something unfunded deferred compensation may not have, or it would be income to the employee.&lt;ref name="DefComp"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
*Non-profit (excluding churches) organizations may offer a 457(b) plan that CANNOT be funded. This does not mean the employer may not set aside funds in trust with the intent to pay them out to the employee in future years. "Unfunded" simply means there may not be an "economic benefit", which almost always means that the employer must hold them as assets to the non-profit organization, subject to the claims of their creditors. This also generally means that plans balances are not transferable between employers.&lt;ref name="DefComp"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-qualified retirement plan==
A [[Non-qualified retirement plan | non-qualified retirement plan]] does not meet the requirements of Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a) and the [[Employee Retirement Income Security Act]] (ERISA) and therefore ''does not qualify'' for favorable tax treatment.

In essence, a non-qualified retirement plan is a contract to provide pension benefits. Individuals can create one, but most are created by employers.

Contributors to non-qualified plans don't get the same tax benefits as contributors to qualified plans, such as [[401(k) | 401(k)s]], do. However, non-qualified plans can be much more flexible in setting benefit amounts and timing payouts.

The contributions made to these plans are usually nondeductible to the employer and are usually taxable to the employee. However, they allow employees to defer taxes until retirement. Non-qualified plans are often used to created to attract and retain highly paid employees.

==Deferred compensation plan (non-qualified)==
[[Deferred compensation | Deferred compensation]] is the term used for future income that would have otherwise been realized in the present.

But when used in context by employers, the name denotes a non-qualified "promise to pay" on the part of the employ&lt;u&gt;er&lt;/u&gt;. There are many forms, which often include the increased valuation of the company's stock, measures of executive performance, cash value built in life insurance, salary increases/bonuses for the next year not paid by the employer but kept in a company trust, and so on.

Each participating employee needs to understand that the assets set aside in a Deferred Compensation plan are nothing more than the employer's promise to pay them at a future date. This promise is only as good as the employer's ability to keep it, i.e. assets are at risk if the employer fails. This is a different situation than qualified plans, where vested vested account balances are 100% owned by the employee ''regardless of employer status''.

Deferred compensation plans are very hard to describe, as it is at the employer's discretion. It is really about contract law: A written agreement between an employee and employer, and is not subject to the statutory law administered by the DOL and IRS that governs qualified plans.&lt;ref name="DefComp"&gt;[https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=42838 Deferred compensation--what is it?], in the bogleheads.org forum&lt;/ref&gt;

{{for|additional information|wikipedia:SEP-IRA}}

A SEP is a '''simplified employee pension''' plan. A SEP plan provides employers with a simplified method to make contributions toward their employees’ retirement and, if self-employed, their own retirement. Contributions are made directly to an Individual Retirement Account or Annuity (IRA) set up for each employee (a SEP-IRA).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irs.gov/retirement/article/0,,id=111419,00.html#1 IRS:Retirement Plans FAQs regarding SEPs]&lt;/ref&gt; Employer contributions to a SEP-IRA are 100% vested to the employee and are not included in the employee's gross taxable income.

==Establishing an SEP==

According to the IRS, there are three basic steps involved in setting up an SEP.

* A formal written agreement must be executed. This written agreement may be satisfied by adopting an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) model SEP using [http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f5305sep.pdf Form 5305-SEP], ''Simplified Employee Pension - Individual Retirement Accounts Contribution Agreement''. A prototype SEP that was approved by the IRS may also be used. Approved prototype SEPs are offered by banks, insurance companies, and other qualified financial institutions. Finally, an individually designed SEP may be adopted.

*Each eligible employee must be given certain information about the SEP. If the SEP was established using the Form 5305-SEP, the information must include a copy of the Form 5305-SEP, its instructions, and the other information listed in the Form 5305-SEP instructions. If a prototype SEP or individually designed SEP was used, similar information must be provided.

*A SEP-IRA must be set up for each eligible employee. SEP-IRAs can be set up with banks, insurance companies, or other qualified financial institutions. The SEP-IRA is owned and controlled by the employee and the employer sends the SEP contributions to the financial institution where the SEP-IRA is maintained.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irs.gov/retirement/article/0,,id=111419,00.html#1 IRS:Retirement Plans FAQs regarding SEPs]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eligible employees==
Generally, any employee who performs services for a business must be included in a SEP. However, there are some exceptions to this general rule. Among the employees that may be excluded from a SEP are those who:

* Have not worked for the company during three out of the last five years.
* Have not reached age 21 during the year for which contributions are made.
* Are employees who are covered by a union agreement and whose retirement benefits were bargained for in good faith by the employees’ union and you.
* Are nonresident alien employees who have received no U.S. source wages, salaries, or other personal services compensation from you.
* Received less than $750 in compensation in 2025, $800 in 2026, subject to cost-of-living adjustments in later years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/401k-limit-increases-to-24500-for-2026-ira-limit-increases-to-7500| title=401(k) limit increases to $24,500 for 2026, IRA limit increases to $7,500| publisher=IRS| accessdate=27 November 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A SEP cannot have a last-day-of-the-year employment requirement. Eligible employees must share in any SEP contribution. This includes eligible employees who die or quit working before the contribution is made.

Contributions for a year must be deposited by the due date (including extensions) for filing the business Federal income tax return for the year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irs.gov/retirement/article/0,,id=111396,00.html IRS: Operating a SEP]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contributions==
Most SEPs, including the IRS model Form 5305-SEP, require that allocations to all employees' SEP-IRAs be proportional (the same percentage of salary/wages be contributed for all participants). Contributions are not required to be made every year, but in years contributions are made to the SEP, they must be made to the SEP-IRAs of all eligible employees. Whether a business owner is considered an employee of the business, or a self-employed proprietor, is dependent on the way the business is organized. If the business is organized as a S or C corporation, an incorporated partnership, or a Limited Liability Company (LLC) electing to be taxed as a corporation, the business owner is ordinarily paid a wage and is considered an employee of the company for tax purposes.&lt;ref name="BCM"&gt;[http://www.sepira.com/ SEP IRA], Beacon Capital Management Advisors &lt;/ref&gt;

Annual contributions an employer makes to an employee’s SEP-IRA cannot exceed the lesser of:

#25% of compensation, or
#$70,000 for 2025, $72,000 for 2026, subject to annual cost-of-living adjustments for later years.

If the business is organized as an unincorporated business such as a sole proprietorship, unincorporated partnership or a LLC electing to be taxed as a sole proprietorship, the owner is considered, for tax purposes, to be self employed.&lt;ref name= "BCM" /&gt; A self-employed owner’s SEP-IRA contribution is based on net profit minus one-half self-employment tax minus the SEP contribution for him or herself. See [http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p560.pdf IRS Publication 560]which includes [http://www.irs.gov/publications/p560/ch05.html the tables] used for determining the owner's SEP-IRA contribution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irs.gov/retirement/article/0,,id=111419,00.html#1 IRS:Retirement Plans FAQs regarding SEPs]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distributions==
Withdrawals from a SEP-IRA are taxable. Withdrawals prior to age 59 1/2 are subject to a 10% penalty tax. [[IRA Distribution Tables | Required Minimum Distributions]] must begin by the age of 75 for retired individuals. If in any year the distributions from a SEP-IRA are less than the required minimum distribution for the year, you may have to pay the ''Tax on excess accumulations (insufficient distributions)'', a 25% excise tax for that year on the amount not distributed as required, reduced to 10% if corrected within two years. The tax on excess accumulations is reported on [http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f5329.pdf Form 5329].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irs.gov/publications/p590/ch01.html#en_US_publink10006460 IRS Publication 590]&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar to [[Traditional IRA]]s, SEP-IRAs have the following exceptions to the early withdrawal penalty tax:

:# A first-time home purchase (lifetime maximum is $10,000).
:#Post-secondary education expenses.
:#[[SEPP:Substantially Equal Periodic Payments |Substantially equal periodic payments]] taken under IRS guidelines.
:#Medical expenses exceeding 7.5% of your adjusted gross income.
:#An IRS levy on the SEP-IRA.
:#Health insurance premiums (after you've received at least 12 consecutive weeks of unemployment compensation).
:#Disability.
:#Death.&lt;ref&gt;[https://personal.vanguard.com/us/accounttypes/retirement/ATSSEPIRADistContent.jsp Vanguard SEP:Taking a Distribution]&lt;/ref&gt;

Details on these exceptions can be found in [http://www.irs.gov/publications/p590/ch01.html#en_US_publink10006430 IRS Publication 590].

==Rollovers==

You may rollover your SEP-IRA into a number of tax-deferred accounts. Retirement plan assets can be rolled over into an SEP-IRA:&lt;ref&gt; Vanguard SEP Transfer Form &lt;/ref&gt;

The Federal '''{{PAGENAME}}''' (TSP) is a retirement savings plan for civilian and military employees of the United States Government. It is similar to a [[401(k)]] in that it is a defined contribution plan that is managed by the employee, and it has the same contribution limits and very favorable fees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-08-12/brokers-lure-soldiers-out-of-low-fee-federal-retirement-plan.html Bloomberg: Brokers Lure Soldiers Out of Low-Fee Federal Retirement Plan]&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[401(k)#Roth 401(k) | Roth 401(k)]] option commenced on May 7, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.tsp.gov/PDF/formspubs/high12c.pdf TSP Highlights], July 2012. As of July, not all agencies and services are accepting elections for Roth contributions because they are still making the necessary technical and programmatic changes to their payroll systems.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funds==

There are five core funds in the TSP and a family of [[TSP Lifecycle Funds|Lifecycle funds]] that invest in the core funds. The core funds are:

* '''[[G Fund]]''': a uniquely attractive bond fund that provides yields similar to an intermediate-term Treasury bond fund, but with the stability of principal of a money market fund, and no default risk.
* '''F Fund''': a fixed income index [[Collective Investment Trusts|commingled trust]] that tracks the [[Bloomberg US Aggregate Bond Index]].
* '''C Fund''': a large-to-mid cap stock index commingled trust that tracks the [[S&amp;P 500 index|S&amp;P 500 Stock Index]]. 
* '''S Fund''': a mid-to-small cap stock index commingled trust that tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Completion Total Stock Market Index, commonly known as an [[Extended market index fund]].
* '''[[I Fund]]''': an international stock index commingled trust that tracks the MSCI All Country World Ex-US Investible Market Index (a total international index) except for China and Hong Kong. 

In addition to the core funds the TSP offers Lifecycle (L) funds. Each of the L funds are [[Target date retirement funds]] which maintain a mix of the above five core funds that adjusts over time in anticipation of the employee's expected retirement date.&lt;ref&gt;''Summary of the Thrift Savings Plan'' pp.11-12.&lt;/ref&gt; The TSP Lifecycle funds employ an active investing approach for setting the funds' glide paths, which is based on efficient frontier analysis using capital market assumptions over a 20-year time horizon and stochastic modeling projections for inflation, economic growth, salary growth, corporate profits, P/E ratios, interest rates, and exchange rates.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.frtib.gov/pdf/minutes/MM-2016Nov-Att6.pdf Thrift Savings Plan Lifecycle Fund Asset Allocation,] Mercer, November 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, the TSP offers a [[Thrift Savings Plan#Mutual fund window|mutual fund window]], which allows investors to invest in almost any mutual fund. 

=== G Fund ===
{{Main|G Fund}}
The [[G Fund]] offers the opportunity to earn rates of interest comparable to those of intermediate-term Government securities but without any risk of loss of principal and very little volatility of earnings. The G Fund is invested in short-term U.S. Treasury securities specially issued to the TSP. Payment of principal and interest is guaranteed by the U.S. Government. Thus, there is no "credit risk". The interest rate resets monthly and is based on the weighted average yield of all outstanding Treasury notes and bonds with 4 or more years to maturity. Earnings consist entirely of interest income on the securities. Interest on G Fund securities has, over time, outpaced inflation and 90-day T-bills.

The G Fund is a uniquely good deal for investors, as it has a risk/return profile unrivaled by any other fixed income instrument:

* It is risk-free, like Treasury bonds;
* The yield is equal to the average of intermediate-term Treasury bonds; 
* Like a money market, and unlike Treasuries, its price never goes down; 
* And, because it repurchases its bonds daily, it provides some of the inflation protection of [[TIPS]].

=== International funds ===
{{Main|I Fund}}
The I Fund is an international stock index commingled trust that tracks the MSCI Ex-US index but excludes China and Hong Kong; it does include other emerging markets, and international small-cap.

=== Replicating total stock market ===
{{See also|Approximating total stock market}}
Many TSP investors wish to use the C and S funds to replicate the Total Stock Market. You can hold the C Fund (tracks the S&amp;P 500) and S Fund (tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Completion Total 
Stock Market (TSM) Index) in a 5-to-1 ratio to approximate the total stock market. According to the TSP, "As of December 31, 2020, [...] the Dow Jones U.S. Completion TSM Index made up approximately 18% of the market value of the U.S. stock markets; the S&amp;P 500 accounted for the other 82%. Thus, the combined S Fund and C Fund cover virtually all U.S. stocks."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.tsp.gov/publications/tsplf14.pdf TSP Fund Information], Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board, Mar 2021.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mutual fund window ===
The mutual fund window allows TSP investors to invest in many non-TSP mutual funds. However, the mutual fund window charges additional fees to cover its costs, which make it much less attractive; TSP investors who want non-TSP funds may prefer to hold them at lower cost in an [[IRA]] or [[HSA]]. The costs may be reasonable for investors with a very large TSP balance who want to add only a few funds.

Investors may move up to 25% of their TSP to the mutual fund window, with a minimum investment of $10,000. There is a $55 annual administrative fee, $95 annual maintenance fee, and a fee of $28.75 per trade. Thus an investor who holds only one fund in the window, purchasing it once per year, pays an annual fee of $188.75 in addition to the costs of the fund. If the TSP balance is $400,000, this would allow an investment of $100,000, so the extra fee would be equivalent to 0.19% in extra expenses. An investor holding two funds would pay $217.50, equivalent to 0.22% in extra expenses on the same $100,000 investment.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.tsp.gov/mutual-fund-window/]TSP mutual fund window&lt;/ref&gt;

== Portfolio tracking ==
=== Most similar Funds ===

Since the TSP funds do not have tickers, people occasionally want to know which funds most closely approximate the TSP, for substitutions in spreadsheets and online fund trackers. Vanguard's Institutional funds track the same indexes as the main four TSP funds and are very similar, although all of them have higher fees than the TSP. Comparable funds from [[Fidelity]] are also shown:

== Fees ==
TSP funds are operated with low [[Expense ratios |expense ratios]], currently at 0.037%-0.051%.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;See the [https://www.tsp.gov/funds-individual/ TSP individual funds] for fund-specific expenses. Viewed November 27, 2025.&lt;/ref&gt; The TSP fund expense ratios are comparable to those of Vanguard and Fidelity. By contrast, all-in expenses for most 401(k) plans are far higher than the TSP, with a 2013 study finding that the median 401(k) participant pays 23 times more than the TSP in all-in expenses,&lt;ref name="ici._ICI-"&gt;{{Cite web | title = ICI - Retirement Plan Fees Vary with Plan Size and Diversified Equity Holdings, Deloitte/ICI Study Finds | author = | work = ici.org | date = 2014-08-20 | accessdate = 2017-12-09 | url = https://www.ici.org/pressroom/news/14_news_deloitte_ici | quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a 2012 study finding typical 401(k) fees were 30 to 40 times higher than the TSP.&lt;ref name="shrm_401("&gt;{{Cite web | title = 401(k) Plan Fees Declined—Slightly—in 2012 | author = | work = SHRM | date = 28 February 2013 | accessdate = 2017-12-09 | url = https://www.shrm.org/ResourcesAndTools/hr-topics/benefits/Pages/401k-Feeseclined.aspx | quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt; For current and former federal government employees who have access to it, the TSP is a spectacularly good deal.&lt;ref&gt;''Summary of the Thrift Savings Plan'' p 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Matching ==
{{See also|Employer matching contributions}}
The federal government matches employee TSP contributions for certain civilian employees, and (after 2017)&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tsp.gov/PDF/formspubs/tspfs1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; for members of the military but not employees under the Civil Service Retirement System. For those qualified for matches, the match rates are: 1% automatic match (independent of employee contribution), followed by 1% for each 1% of employee contribution (up to a maximum of 3%), then 0.5% for each 1% of employee contribution (to an additional 1% maximum). Thus, employees may receive up to 1% + 3% + 1% = 5% of their salary in matching contributions.&lt;ref&gt;''Summary of the Thrift Savings Plan'' p 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gaining the maximum match ===
{{Quote
|title=TSP: How to get the Max
|quote="In order to get the maximum Agency Matching Contributions, you must not only contribute 5% of your basic pay each period, but you must also contribute all year long. If you reach the IRS annual limit before the end of the year, your contributions (and consequently, your Agency Matching Contributions) will stop."
|source = [https://www.tsp.gov/planparticipation/eligibility/typesOfContributions.shtml#agencyMatching TSP.gov]
}}
Agency matching contributions are made each paycheck. Therefore, to gain the maximum match, an employee must contribute at least 5% throughout the entire year. If the employee reaches the IRS contribution limit for the calendar year, then the employee's contributions will automatically stop and the agency matching contributions will stop too.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.tsp.gov/planparticipation/eligibility/typesOfContributions.shtml#agencyMatching Agency Matching Contributions] at TSP.gov&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, to gain the maximum match, ensure that:
* You contribute at least 5% of your salary for each pay period throughout the year.
* You don't reach the annual IRS contribution limit before the last paycheck.

For employees who want to meet the IRS annual contribution limit for the year ($22,500 for 2023, $23,000 for 2024), you need to be careful that you don't hit the limit too early (and forgo agency matches) or too late (and fall short of the maximum contribution limit). This can be particularly tricky if your salary changes or if you have a variable salary. Some people also like to front-load contributions earlier in the year; if you do this, ensure that you don't front-load so aggressively that you hit the IRS limit before the end of the year, which could cause you to miss out on the maximum agency match, and don't front-load your contributions to the point where you don't have enough to keep contributing 5% of your salary in each pay period. TSP participants may wish to use the TSP's online [https://www.tsp.gov/PlanningTools/Calculators/electiveContributions.html How Much Can I Contribute?] calculator in order to ensure they are contributing the maximum amount; note that in a typical year, there are 26 pay periods, but depending on the calendar year, some years have had a different number of pay periods.

== Fund transfers ==

A TSP participant may redistribute TSP assets across funds at any time (called an "Interfund Transfer" or IFT). IFTs submitted before noon Eastern are effective at close of business that day. IFTs submitted later are effective at close of business the following day. IFTs are limited in number per month to curb costs of frequent trading. Participants can make two unrestricted IFTs per calendar month. After that, only IFTs that transfer funds into the G fund are permitted. If one of the first two IFTs in a month moves funds into the G fund it counts toward the two unrestricted transfers for that month.&lt;ref&gt;''Summary of the Thrift Savings Plan'' p.15.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transferring into TSP ==
{{Main|TSP transfers and rollovers}}
The TSP allows current and former employees of the federal government to rollover their 401(k)s and IRAs into the TSP. The TSP does not allow transfers from a [[Roth IRA]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.tsp.gov/PlanParticipation/EligibilityAndContributions/RolloversTransfers/methods.html#rollingOver TSP: Methods for Moving Your Money into Your TSP Account], viewed October 7, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, a federal employee might switch to an employer where she has a 401(k) plan. If she then leaves there, to a third employer, she would normally rollover her 401(k) to an IRA, such as one with Vanguard. Since the TSP offers the lowest cost funds available anywhere, it provides a slightly better value than Vanguard. (The TSP is almost certainly a better value than the second employer's 401(k) plans, which on average have expenses 30 to 40 times worse than the TSP; see [[#Fees|fees]].) The employee can rollover the assets from her second employer's plan to the TSP. Thus, as long as federal employees never close their TSP accounts by withdrawing their full balance, the TSP remains a valuable benefit to federal service, even after switching jobs.

== Transferring out of TSP ==
{{Main|TSP withdrawals}}
Important rules for withdrawing funds from the TSP are that only you cannot easily remove just the Roth TSP portion, leaving the Traditional portion. All withdrawals, including Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs), are taken proportionally from Roth and Traditional account balances.

== Qualified charitable distributions ==
[[Qualified charitable distributions]] (QCDs) can not be taken from employer-sponsored retirement plans, such as the TSP. QCDs can only be taken from an [[IRA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=What are Qualified Charitable Distributions Anyway?|url=https://feea.org/2019/02/28/qualified-charitable-distributions/|access-date=December 13, 2021|website=Federal Employee Education and Assistance Fund}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To avoid a taxable event, transfer funds intended for charity into a qualified IRA.

==List of forms==
The following table provides a list of all forms used by TSP participants and beneficiaries but not available on the TSP's official website. For the forms available on the TSP's official website, please go to [https://www.tsp.gov//forms/index.html TSP: Forms &amp; Publications].

      <text bytes="5308" sha1="p6zv3snordbsts9zlle0qvubuu6frt6" xml:space="preserve">The '''G Fund''' (Government Securities Investment Fund) is one of six investment offerings inside the [[Thrift Savings Plan]], a contributory retirement program for federal employees, members of the uniformed services, and their beneficiaries.

The G Fund is a uniquely good deal for investors, as it has a risk/return profile unrivaled by any other fixed income instrument:
* It is risk-free, like Treasury bonds;
* The yield is equal to the average of intermediate-term Treasury bonds; 
* Like a money market, and unlike Treasuries, its price never goes down; 
* And, because it repurchases its bonds daily, it provides some of the inflation protection of [[TIPS]].

== Securities and returns ==
G Fund securities are non-marketable U.S. Treasury securities with one business day maturities (up to four days on holiday weekends). The rate is set by a statutorily prescribed formula which is determined by the weighted average of all treasuries with maturities four years or more.

Monthly returns can be found at the TSP website here: [https://www.tsp.gov/investmentfunds/monthly/monthlyReturns.shtml Monthly Returns]

==Key features==
*The G Fund offers the opportunity to earn rates of interest similar to those of long-term Government securities but without any risk of loss of principal.
*The objective of the G Fund is to maintain a higher return than inflation without exposing the fund to risk of default or changes in market prices.
*The interest rate resets monthly and is based on the weighted average yield of all outstanding Treasury notes and bonds with four or more years to maturity.
*Earnings consist entirely of interest income on the securities.
*Interest on G Fund securities has, over time, outpaced inflation and 90-day T-bills.

==G Fund and TIPS==

You can read Ennis Knupp + Associates recommendation to the FRTIB&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The [http://www.frtib.gov/ Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board] is an independent agency established to administer the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP).&lt;/ref&gt; about [[Treasury Inflation Protected Securities | TIPS (Treasury Inflation Protected Securities)]] and the G Fund here, [http://www.frtib.gov/pdf/FOIA/Investment-Option-Review-FINAL_10-2006.pdf "Investment Option Review Report, October 2006"].{{broken link}}

Of particular interest is:
{{blockquote|Importantly, TSP participants are offered inflation protection via the G Fund. As yields of nominal U.S. Treasury securities generally reflect expected inflation plus a real return component, if inflation increases or is expected to increase, the yields of Treasuries are expected to increase; and the G Fund’s yield should increase as well. The benefit TSP participants have is that the principal value of their G Fund investments does not decline - as a result they do not experience any price volatility. Investors who purchase nominal bonds or TIPS do incur price volatility, which makes the G Fund much more attractive. The characteristics of the G Fund provide a powerful diversification benefit and negate much of the benefits a TIPS fund could provide to TSP participants.}}

Over a long observation period, the G Fund is expected to have returns on par (or above) TIPS. In withdrawal phase portfolios where volatility can make an impact in portfolio survivability, G Fund may be preferable. Although G Fund and TIPS goal of real return are the same, TIPS provide a known real return, whereas the G Fund real return is not known in advance.

==G Fund and inflation==
The [[Thrift Savings Plan |TSP (Thrift Savings Plan)]] states the objective of the G Fund is to maintain a higher return than inflation without exposing the fund to risk of default or changes in market prices.

Nominal treasuries yields can be considered to have three components: an inflation forecast, a real return above inflation forecast, plus an inflation risk premium. Just like nominal bonds, G Fund will outpace inflation during periods of expected inflation, and disinflation/deflation. However, unlike nominal bonds, G Fund does not lose value in a rising rate (rising inflation) environment. The G Fund yields will start averaging up every month as new nominal treasuries are issued with the new inflation estimates in their returns. However, there may be a period where inflation outpaces G Fund returns.

Over a long observation period, the G Fund is expected to outpace the growth of inflation. The premiums returned over inflation during periods of expected inflation and unexpected disinflation, compensate for the possible lagging returns when inflation is unexpected. The data from TSP supports this. Due to the averaging effects, G Fund related securities under paced inflation for 1979 and 1980, but significantly outperformed the subsequent year as G Fund related securities rates averaged down, so that by 1981 the G Fund related securities had recovered the deficit of the previous two years.

{{hatnote|For a full discussion, see [https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/206.asp Qualified vs. Nonqualified Retirement Plans: What’s the Difference?]}}

A '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a plan that does not meet the requirements of Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a) and the [[Employee Retirement Income Security Act | Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974]] (ERISA) and therefore ''does not qualify'' for favorable tax treatment.

In essence, a non-qualified retirement plan is a contract to provide pension benefits. Individuals can create one, but most are created by employers.

Contributors to non-qualified plans do not get the same tax benefits as contributors to qualified plans, such as [[401(k)]]s, do. However, non-qualified plans can be much more flexible in setting benefit amounts and timing payouts.

The contributions made to these plans are usually nondeductible to the employer and taxable to the employee. However, they allow employees to defer taxes until retirement. Employers often use non-qualified plans to attract and retain highly paid employees.

A '''{{PAGENAME}}''' (SDBA) is an option found in some [[Qualified retirement plan | qualified retirement plans]] such as a [[ 401(k) ]] that allow the participant to invest in a wider selection of investments than is provided within the plan.  A SDBA is a sub-account of the qualified retirement plan and money (not investments) can be moved between the SDBA and the qualified plan fund choices.  The SDBA may allow the participant to purchase mutual funds without an additional brokerage account, or a brokerage account can be opened and tied to the SDBA for purchasing stocks, bonds and ETFs.  ERISA regulations disallow investments in certain types of assets (i.e. company stock, commodities, futures, real estate).

This type of account is also sometimes called:

* Self Directed Brokerage Account
* Self Directed Account
* Individually Directed Account

==Benefits==

The primary benefit of a SDBA is that it allows the participant to invest in a wider selection of assets than what is available in the qualified retirement plan.  Common reasons for using a SDBA are:

* choosing lower cost funds/ETFs (ER)
* investing in asset classes not available in the qualified plan (e.g. international small or value)
* choosing passive funds/ETFs
* choosing a higher quality bond fund

==Disadvantages==

===Costs===

SDBAs typically have additional costs on top of fees charged for the qualified retirement plan account:

* Yearly custodial fees (sometimes charged as percent of AUM)
* Yearly account fees
* Transaction fees (moving assets between qualified plan funds and SDBA funds/brokerage account)
* Trading fees (brokerage fees)
* Setup fees (per fund)

The participant should calculate the expected cost of using a SDBA taking into account all fees that would apply and compare it to the cost of using the fund choices in the qualified plan in order to help guide the decision to open a SDBA.  Even when using a lower cost mutual fund or ETF, the additional SDBA fees may require larger investment amounts to become cost effective.

{{for|additional information|wikipedia:457 plan}}

&lt;onlyinclude&gt;Created in 1978, a '''457(b)''' plan is a non-qualified tax-deferred compensation plan similar to qualified plans such as the [[401(k)]] and [[403(b)]]. If you work for a state or local government or for a tax-exempt organization, you may be able to participate in a  section 457 deferred compensation plan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/457 26 USC § 457 - Deferred compensation plans of State and local governments and tax-exempt organizations], Legal Information Institute, Cornell Law School &lt;/ref&gt; The 457 plan may be available as an additional voluntary retirement savings vehicle for state or local government or tax-exempt organization employers also offering a public employees pension system. Or they can be offered as a supplemental retirement option for those state or local government or tax-exempt organization employers offering a 401(k) or 403(b) plan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.457bwise.com/faqs/index.html 403(b)wise. 457 FAQ] &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;&lt;!--- used for retirement plan overview --&gt;

Although 457 plans rarely provide an employer matching contribution, there is no federal 10 percent premature distribution penalty imposed on withdrawals from a 457(b) plan when separating from service.&lt;ref&gt;[https://403bwise.com/k12/content/18 403(b)wise. 457b]&lt;/ref&gt;

As always, costs matter, so before investing evaluate the fees and expenses of the investment options available in the 457 plan you are considering. Each plan chooses which investment alternatives to offer eligible employees, so fund choices and associated fees and expenses can vary.

==Types of 457 plans==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;!--- used for retirement plan overview --&gt;
There are two basic types of 457 plans:
:*''' Government Plans''': Local and state governments are eligible to establish a 457(b) plan for their employees. This type of 457(b) covers employees of a state (including the District of Columbia), a political subdivision of a state, any agency or instrumentality of a state, or political subdivision of a state. These types of employees can include: local and state government workers, fire fighters, police personnel, and public school employees. 

::Section 1448 of the Small Business Jobs Protection Act of 1996 (SBJPA) added 457(g) of the Code, which requires that 457(b) plans maintained by state or local government employers hold all plan assets and income in trust, or in custodial accounts or annuity contracts (described in 401(f) of the Code), for the exclusive benefit of their participants and beneficiaries. 

::Contributions to the 457(b) plan qualify for the [[Saver's credit|saver's credit]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irs.gov/publications/p571/ch10.html Pub 571 savers credit], IRS &lt;/ref&gt;
:* '''Non-Government Plans''': Tax-exempt organizations that are non-governmental (hospitals, charitable organizations, unions, among others) must generally limit participation to a select group of management or highly compensated employees. This is due to the rules under Title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA).

::ERISA generally requires that a private retirement plan providing benefits to employees be funded by a trust or annuity contract. The rules, however, require that private 457(b) plans be unfunded in order to obtain tax benefits. Therefore, a plan will violate ERISA unless an exception applies. This provision means that the 457 plan assets are the property of the sponsoring employer and are subject to the employer's general creditors, until paid out to plan participants.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/non-governmental-457b-deferred-compensation-plans. IRS Non_ Governmental 457b Deferred Compensation Plans]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;&lt;!--- used for retirement plan overview --&gt;

Each 457 plan is required to have a written plan document. It is essential to refer to this document for the details on how your 457 plan operates, including the investment options offered by the plan, fees and expenses, and specific withdrawal options.&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

===Roth 457(b)===
If an employer offers a Roth 457(b) provision, an employee can designate all or a portion of their 457(b) as an after-tax Roth contribution. These contributions are made with after tax earnings. Unlike the advantage a pre-tax 457(b) has over pre-tax 401(k) and 403(b) plans, withdrawals from a Roth 457(b) are subject to the same age 59.5 restrictions as other Roth plans.  Worse yet for those taking pre-59.5 withdrawals, Roth 457(b) distributions are taken on a pro-rata basis between contributions and gains, unlike the "contributions first" treatment given to Roth IRA distributions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=222789 Roth 457 vs. Roth IRA - Bogleheads.org]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Employees have the option of making pre-tax 457(b) contributions, Roth 457(b) contributions, or a combination of the two. Total contributions cannot exceed the year's contribution limit.&lt;ref&gt;[https://403bwise.com/k12/content/18 457(b)], 403(b)wise.com. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Contributions==
The contribution limits are the same as for other employer plans.  However, participants may invest the maximum allowable contribution in both a 457 plan and a [[401(k)]] or [[403(b) | 403(b)]] plan of both are available.  The combined maximum contribution for 2026 is thus $49,000. The [[#Catch up provision |"final three year"]] and Age 50+
catch-up cannot be used in the same tax year.&lt;ref&gt;[https://dcprovider.com/PDF/tn/Tenn_Plan_Comparison_FINAL_03182013.pdf Comparison of the Governmental 457(b) and 401(k) Plans]&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the age 50+  and 60-63 higher limits are only applicable to governmental 457 plans, not to non-governmental plans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Non-governmental 457(b) deferred compensation plans|url=https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/non-governmental-457b-deferred-compensation-plans|access-date=June 25, 2025|website=Internal Revenue Service}}&lt;/ref&gt; The table below reflects 457 plan contribution limits, again noting that 50+ and 60-63 catchup contributions aren’t applicable to non-governmental 457 plans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=What is a 457(b) plan and how does it work?|url=https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/smart-money/what-is-a-457b|access-date=June 25, 2025|website=Fidelity Investments}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Catch-up contributions for 2026 must be made to a Roth account if the employee's 2025 salary was over $150,000.

{{Retirement Plan Contribution Limits}}
===Catch up provision===
The 457(b) plan often contains a special "catch-up" provision called the "final three year" provision for those approaching retirement (assuming they haven't contributed the maximum amount in prior years). Employers are not required to offer this provision. For those that do, the "catch-up" provision kicks in during the three years prior to "normal" retirement age (as defined in the plan). This provision, now permits up to 200% of the elective deferral limit, or $47,000 in 2025, $49,000 in 2026.

{{Notice|''Example'': Victor will reach "normal" retirement age in 2021; under his plan he can take advantage of the "final three year" provision in years 2018, 2019, and 2020. If Victor takes advantage of this provision he cannot also take advantage of the "Age 50 catch-up" provision. Note: to determine the underutilized amounts in prior years all of the prior coordination rules apply.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.457bwise.com/faqs/index.html 457bwise. 457 FAQ]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Investment options==
457(b) plans can be funded with:
:*Group [[Fixed annuity|fixed]] and [[Variable annuity|variable annuities]]
:*Retail [[Mutual fund|mutual funds]]
:*Bank instruments
:*A combination of all three

==Withdrawals==
Government 457(b) plans are subject to income tax upon withdrawal but are not subject to the 10% early withdrawal penalty. Funds can be withdrawn at retirement, upon severance from the employer, upon death, upon disability, and under stringent hardship withdrawal rules. Funds must be withdrawn at age 73 (unless you are still working) and are subject to the [[IRA distribution tables|required minimum distributions]] rules.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irs.gov/Retirement-Plans/Retirement-Plans-FAQs-regarding-Required-Minimum-Distributions Retirement Plans FAQs regarding Required Minimum Distributions], IRS &lt;/ref&gt; Different rules apply if you work for a tax-exempt organization (you must see the employer plan document for the details.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.457bwise.com/faqs/index.html 403(b)wise. 457 FAQ]&lt;/ref&gt;
  
===Hardship withdrawals===
The IRS has strict guidelines for allowable hardship withdrawals:

Under a 457(b) plan, a hardship distribution can only occur when the participant is faced with an unforeseeable emergency. (Code § 457(d)(1)(iii))

An unforeseeable emergency is a severe financial hardship resulting from an illness or accident, loss of property due to casualty, or other similar extraordinary and unforeseeable circumstances arising as a result of events beyond the control of the participant or beneficiary. Examples of events that may be considered unforeseeable emergencies include imminent foreclosure on, or eviction from, the employee's home, medical expenses, and funeral expenses. Generally, the purchase of a home and the payment of college tuition are not unforeseeable emergencies.
(Reg. § 1.457-6(c)(2)(i))

Whether a participant or beneficiary is faced with an unforeseeable emergency depends on the facts and circumstances. However, a distribution is not on account of an unforeseeable emergency to the extent that the emergency can be relieved through reimbursement or compensation from insurance, liquidation of the participant's assets, or cessation of deferrals under the plan. (Reg. § 1.457-6(c)(2)(ii))

A distribution on account of an unforeseeable emergency must not exceed the amount reasonably necessary to satisfy the emergency need. (Reg. § 1.457-6(c)(2)(iii))&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irs.gov/retirement/article/0,,id=162416,00.html IRS Retirement Plans FAQs regarding Hardship Distributions]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rollovers==
{{401k rollover infobox}}
An employer is not required to accept rollover contributions, so it is necessary to check a 457(b) plan's written document for its rules on plan rollovers.
 
Rollover provisions are more liberal for a government 457(b) plan than for non-government 457 plans. A government 457(b) plan can be rolled over to another employer's 457 plan, a 401(k) plan, a 403(b) plan or a rollover [[Traditional IRA|traditional IRA.]] However, assets transferred out of the 457 into a non 457 plan will lose the exemption to the early withdrawal penalty that 457 plans enjoy. Likewise, if you roll non 457 plan assets into an employer provided 457 plan, these assets do not gain exemption from the early withdrawal penalty.

Non-government 457 plans can only be rolled over to another non government 457 plan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p4484.pdf  IRS:Choose a Retirement Plan]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{for|a full discussion|wikipedia:Defined benefit pension plan}}

A '''defined benefit pension plan''' promises a specified monthly benefit at retirement. The most common type of monthly benefit is predetermined by a formula based on the employee's earnings history, tenure of service and age, rather than depending on investment returns. It is 'defined' in the sense that the formula for computing the employer's contribution is known in advance.

In the United States, [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/26/414.html#j 26 U.S.C. § 414(j)] specifies a defined benefit plan to be any pension plan that is not a defined contribution plan where a defined contribution plan is any plan with individual accounts.

A traditional pension plan that defines a benefit for an employee on retirement is a defined benefit plan. The benefits in most traditional defined benefit plans are protected, within certain limitations, by federal insurance provided through the [http://www.pbgc.gov/ Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC)].

{{for|additional information|wikipedia:401(k)}}

A '''401(k)''' plan is a type of employer-sponsored defined-contribution retirement plan. Its name comes from section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/401| title=26 U.S. Code § 401 - Qualified pension, profit-sharing, and stock bonus plans| publisher=Legal Information Institute| accessdate=February 9, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also generally governed by Title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). 

A 401(k) allows eligible employees to elect to contribute some of their pay into the plan through [[payroll deductions]]. Contributions are pre-tax, meaning they are not included in the employee's taxable income, and some plans also have a [[#Roth 401(k)|Roth]] contribution option. Sometimes, employers will make [[employer matching contributions]] or other types of contributions into employees' accounts. Employees can invest their money in the investment choices offered by the plan, typically a selection of stock and bond-based mutual funds, and sometimes other less common investments too. 

Pre-tax money in the plan grows [[Tax_basics#Tax_deferral|tax-deferred]] and is taxable income when later withdrawn, and Roth growth and withdrawals are tax-free subject to some basic [[#Distributions|distribution]] requirements. There is a 10% penalty for taking withdrawals before age 59½, although there are many [[Early_withdrawal|exceptions]]. Pre-tax money is subject to [[Required Minimum Distribution|Required Minimum Distributions]] (RMDs) starting at age 73 or 75, unless you are still working for the employer. Money in a 401(k) can be left to heirs, and most non-spouse heirs will have to empty the account by the end of the 10th year after your death.

==Advantages==
* You get an immediate tax break, because contributions come out of your paycheck before taxes are withheld. Although you will later pay taxes on withdrawals, most people most of the time have a lower tax rate when retired than while working.
** If you think your future tax rate will be similar to or higher than your current tax rate, many plans offer a [[#Roth_401(k)|designated Roth account]], where contributions are taxable, but future growth and withdrawals are tax-free. The choice of pre-tax/traditional or Roth contributors can be a complex [[Traditional versus Roth|tax-planning decision]]. 
* Many employers will [[Employer matching contributions|match your contributions]] at least partially, for example 50 cents on the dollar for the first 6 percent of your salary you save. If an employer has "frozen" the company's defined benefit plan, the company may increase the company match in the 401(k) plan to compensate for the reduced defined plan benefit.
* Tax-deferred growth - meaning you do not pay taxes each year on capital gains, dividends, and other distributions. This feature makes your money grow [[Tax basics|faster]], gives you valuable space to hold [[Tax-efficient fund placement|tax-inefficient investments]], and lets you buy and sell investments for [[rebalancing]] or changing your portfolio without incurring capital gains tax.
* Contributions are deducted from your paycheck before you get access to the money. From a behavioral finance perspective, this reduces the risk you will spend money needed for retirement, and helps you build and maintain the habit of saving. 
* Historically, many 401(k) plans had high fees which made them inferior to [[IRA|IRAs]]. However, 401(k) fees have come down in recent decades, and many plans are competitive with IRAs. Some plans even offer funds with lower fees than IRAs (for example, "Institutional-class" funds) and/or unique investments (for example, a [[stable value fund]] or real estate fund) that may be valuable to certain investors. 
* When eligible to participate, you can normally contribute more to the 401(k) than to your IRA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/plan-participant-employee/retirement-topics-401k-and-profit-sharing-plan-contribution-limits| title=Retirement topics: 401(k) and profit-sharing plan contribution limits| publisher=IRS| accessdate=January 9, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Contributions made to a 401(k) qualify for the Retirement Savings Contributions Credit ([[Saver's credit|Saver's Credit]]) if you meet the filing and income requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/publications/p571| title=Publication 571, Tax-Sheltered Annuity Plans (403(b) Plans)| publisher=IRS| accessdate=January 9, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Especially if the plan is governed by [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employee_Retirement_Income_Security_Act_of_1974 ERISA], money gets a high degree of [[asset protection]] at the federal level. Money in ERISA plans cannot taken by a creditor, even if they successfully sue you and get a judgment, and if you declare bankruptcy you get to keep money in the plan.
* [[Estate planning]] benefits - money can be left to heirs easily via designated beneficiaries (avoiding probate), and non-spouse heirs generally get an additional [[Stretch IRA|10 years]] of tax-deferred or tax-free growth before they have to empty the account.

==Disadvantages==
* Plans are generally not designed to allow access to funds before age 59½ without paying taxes and a 10% penalty.
* The employer chooses the available funds. They may be better (institutional shares) than funds available in personal accounts, or worse (high-cost funds), and they may or may not fit well within your investing plan. (You may have greater fund selection if the plan has a [[Self directed brokerage account]].)
* The plan may only offer funds with embedded fees, and/or charge fees on top of what is charged by the funds. Even seemingly small fees significantly erode long-term performance.
* The employer may change the fund selection, fees, or plan rules at any time.
* Employer contributions may not become ''vested'' (that is, become the property of the employee) until a certain number of years have passed.
* The plans are not insured by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC).

==Contributions==

A 401(k) plan is only required to offer a pre-tax (also known as a "traditional") account, but many plans also offer [[#Roth_401(k)|Roth 401(k)]] and/or [[#After-tax_401(k)|After-tax 401(k)]] accounts. You can only make these three types of regular contributions through direct payroll deductions. 

Pre-tax and Roth sub-accounts share an annual contribution limit, known as the ''elective deferral limit.'' If you are age 50 or older, you get an additional ''catch-up contribution'' limit, which now depends on your age.  Catch-up contributions for 2026 must be made to a Roth 401(k) if the employee's 2025 wages exceeded $150,000. These limits are shown in the following table:

{{Retirement Plan Contribution Limits}}
Employees can generally contribute up to 100% of their wages as elective deferrals. Contributions are included as wages subject to withholding for Social Security and Medicare taxes. In addition, your employer must report the elective contributions as wages subject to federal unemployment taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc424| title=Topic no. 424, 401(k) plans| publisher=IRS| accessdate=January 9, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, there is an overall plan contribution limit, sometimes called the ''Section 415(c) limit'', which as of 2026 is '''$72,000''', not including catch-up contributions. This limit applies to all contributions into the plan, including:

*employee elective deferrals
*employer contributions (matching, profit-sharing, etc.)
*employee after-tax contributions
*[[#Nonelective_contributions|nonelective contributions]]

===Automatic enrollment and contributions===

Employers may configure their plans to automatically enroll eligible employees, unless that employee opts out. You can normally withdraw automatic enrollment contributions penalty free, if you request the withdrawal within 90 days of the first deferral and completed within 6 months of the plan year in which they began. A safe harbor for nondiscrimination testing is available if plans have:
# Initial deferrals of at least 3% of pay, increasing annually by 1% to a number between 6% and 10% of pay,
# Either
## An employer match of 100% on the first 1% and 50% on the next 5% of pay, or
## A 3% nonelective contribution,
# 100% vesting after two years, 
# Default investment selections satisfying Department of Labor regulations, and
# Annual notice to all employees regarding their right to opt out or change the automatic provisions.
Provided the notice requirement is met, and the default investments satisfy Department of Labor regulations, automatic enrollment will be governed by ERISA and preempt any contradictory state laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://institutional.vanguard.com/insights-and-research/perspective/the-power-of-autoenrollment.html| title=The power of autoenrollment| publisher=Vanguard| accessdate=January 9, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Employer match===
{{Main|Employer matching contributions}}

Employers sometimes offer matching contributions when you contribute to pre-tax or Roth accounts. The matching calculation is typically a percentage of employee contributions up to a certain percentage of your salary (for example, 50% of contributions up to 6% of your salary). Until recently, all employer matching contributions went into the pre-tax account regardless of whether the employee's contributions are pre-tax or Roth. However, as of 2022 the SECURE Act 2.0 now allows employers to offer Roth matches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.kitces.com/blog/secure-act-2-omnibus-2022-hr-2954-rmd-75-529-roth-rollover-increase-qcd-student-loan-match/| title=SECURE Act 2.0: Later RMDs, 529-To-Roth Rollovers, And Other Tax Planning Opportunities| publisher=Kitces Nerd's Eye View| author=Jeffrey Levine|date=December 28, 2022|accessdate=January 9, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any Roth matches are taxable income to the employee and must be immediately vested. Employers do not generally match contributions to an after-tax account, but read your plan rules for details.

Getting an employer match should be a top [[Prioritizing investments|financial priority]], as it is like free money, not to mention  money that automatically gets tax-advantaged growth, and asset protection and estate planning benefits.

===Nonelective contributions===

Employers can make certain other contributions not elected by the employees, such as profit sharing contributions. Before 2007, these contributions had to become vested on or faster than either (a) 20% each year from years 3-7 of service or (b) 100% after 5 years of service. Contributions made in and since 2007 must become vested on or faster than either (a) 20% each year from years 2-6 of service or (b) 100% after 3 years of service (with an delayed effective date for collectively bargained plans). 

===Multiple plans===

If you have more than one job, the Section 415(c) plan applies to each plan you have access to as long as the employers are ''unrelated'', meaning that the large-share owners are not the same person or close family members. If a set of businesses are owned by closely related people, the IRS considers them part of a ''controlled group'', and the Section 415(c) limit applies to all plans within this group. Controlled group rules can be very complex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.employeefiduciary.com/blog/is-your-company-part-of-a-controlled-group-you-need-to-know-or-risk-401k-plan-disqualification| title=Is Your Company Part of a Controlled Group?

You get only one elective deferral limit per year, regardless of how many plans you may have access to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.whitecoatinvestor.com/multiple-401k|title=Multiple 401(k) Rules – What to Do with Multiple 401(k) Accounts|author=Dr. Jim Dahle|date=July 21, 2020|accessdate=September 25, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investments==

401(k) plans only offer a set of investments selected by the plan provider, usually in the range of one to several dozen options. Choices typically including a selection of stock and bond [[mutual fund|mutual funds]] and maybe other investments. Historically, employer plans have commonly had high fees, both inside the funds and sometimes added on top of the fund expenses. However, 401(k) plans have come down in recent decades, especially at larger employers. Some plans may even offer better investments than can be purchased inside an [[IRA]] or [[Taxable account|brokerage]] account, such as "institutional-class" funds, a [[stable value fund]], private investments, and others. 

When choosing funds in a 401(k), pay close attention to each investment's [[Expense ratios|expense ratio]]. The data are overwhelming that low-fee [[Index fund|index funds]] and other passive investments statistically outperform high-fee actively-managed funds in the long run.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.whitecoatinvestor.com/managers-dont-beat-markets/|title=Managers Don’t Beat Markets (Why Index Funds Are the Best Way to Invest in the Stock Market)|author=Dr. Jim Dahle|date=March 18, 2025|accessdate=September 25, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt; Look for funds with expense ratios in the range of 0.10% or less. 

Many funds are not necessary to build a good portfolio; in fact, simpler portfolios tend to be better. A great portfolio can be built with just [[Three-fund portfolio|three funds]]. If you have retirement money saved in other places besides the 401(k) ([[IRA|IRAs]], a spouse's [[Employer retirement plans overview|employer plan]], taxable brokerage account, etc.) then you can build a portfolio around a 401(k) with just one good fund. If your plan has no good fund options, see: [[#Expensive_or_mediocre_choices|Expensive or mediocre choices]] below.

Some plans offer a [[Self directed brokerage account|Self-Directed Brokerage Account]] (SDBA) which lets you invest in a wider range of investments. If your plan does not offer any good mutual funds, a SDBA can be used to purchase low-cost [[Exchange-traded fund|exchange-traded funds]] (ETFs). The fee savings of the investments should be weighed against the costs associated with the SDBA. 

===Target retirement funds===
{{See also|Approximating Vanguard target date funds}}

The default option for employer provider plans is to place your contributions and employer matches into a [[Target date retirement funds|target date retirement fund]].

Investors have increased their allocation to target retirement funds over time. Vanguard reports data for the employer provided funds it manages in annual ''"How America Saves"'' studies. Among the findings:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://institutional.vanguard.com/VGApp/iip/site/institutional/clientsolutions/dc/howamericasaves| title=How America Saves 2013| publisher=Vanguard Institutional}}{{dead link}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=June 2025|title=How America Saves 2025|url=https://institutional.vanguard.com/content/dam/inst/iig-transformation/insights/pdf/2025/has/2025_How_America_Saves.pdf|website=Vanguard Institutional}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Employee account balance holdings of target retirement funds increased from a 3% allocation in 2006 to a 63% allocation in 2024.
* Employee contributions to target retirement funds increased from 4% in 2006 to 85% allocation in 2024.
* In 2012, employees 25 years old and younger held 68% of their account balances in target retirement funds.
* In 2012, employees with less than 10,000 dollars in their plans held 56% of their account balances in target retirement funds.
* Employees using target date target-date funds increased from 69% in 2015 to 84% in 2024.

===Employer stock===

Some plans offer employer stock as an investment option, or contribute the employer match in the form of employer stock. Plans offering employer stock must offer at least three diversified investment options with materially different risk and return characteristics. They must allow you to diversify elective deferral contributions immediately (at least quarterly), and also allow you to diversify employer contributions after three years of service.

Because you already have plenty of risk tied with the performance of your employer, keeping your 401(k) contributions in employer stock is not recommended; in contrast, diversifying out of or even complete avoiding employer stock in your 401(k) is strongly recommended. However, if you hold employer stock with a low basis and you are considering a lump sum distribution rollover of plan assets, see [[Net unrealized appreciation]].

==Nondiscrimination==

Under ERISA, retirement plans including 401(k) plans are not allowed to discriminate in favor of [[Highly compensated employee |highly compensated employees]]. They can make corrections by returning the excess contributions to those highly compensated employees within a specified period of time after the plan year ends. The returned funds are taxable income when received. The time period varies based on other features of the plan, generally from 2.5 to 6 months. If not returned timely by the employer, the employee will also be subject to an additional 10% excise tax.

This rule is waived for plans which meet certain safe harbors. Among other attributes, these safe harbor plans are characterized by certain minimum employer contribution rates as well as more favorable vesting provisions for employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Safe Harbor 401k|url= https://www.investopedia.com/safe-harbor-401k-plan-8620915|publisher=Investopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roth 401(k)==
{{See also|Traditional versus Roth}}

An employer may also elect to make Roth 401(k) contributions available; such an account is known as a '''designated Roth account'''. They are the 401(k) equivalent of [[Roth IRA]] contributions, and if the 401(k) is rolled over they can be rolled directly to a Roth IRA or another Roth 401(k). These are normally administered as a sub-account of the employee's 401(k) account. Both Roth and regular contributions are subject to the same contribution limit. Starting in 2024 and later years, RMDs are no longer required from designated Roth 401(k) and 403(b) accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/retirement-plan-and-ira-required-minimum-distributions-faqs#:~:text=Designated%20Roth%20accounts%20in%20a,required%20from%20designated%20Roth%20accounts | title= Retirement plan and IRA Required Minimum Distributions FAQs | publisher=Internal Revenue Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Distributions===

When taking a distribution directly from a designated Roth account (that is, not rolling it over into another account), special rules apply. The account becomes fully qualified when you have met the five-year holding period for the account,&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The five-year holding period for a designated Roth account begins on the first day of the taxable year you make your first contribution to that specific account. It does not matter how long you have had a Roth IRA or any other designated Roth account. This is one of several "five-year rules" that apply to Roth accounts.&lt;/ref&gt; and are either age 59½ or disabled. If the account is not fully qualified, any distributions are ''pro-rata'' - that is, in equal proportions from the basis (contributions) and earnings within the account. The following table summarizes the distribution rules for the simpler case when the account does not contain any In-Plan Roth Rollovers (IRRs):

{| class="wikitable collapsible" width=800px
|-
!  width=500px | 
!  width=500px | Under age 59½, no [[Early withdrawal|exception]]
!  width=500px | Under age 59½, [[Early withdrawal|exception]] other than disability
!  width=500px | Over age 59½ ''or'' disabled
|-
| colspan="4" |
|-
! Five year holding period ''met''
| rowspan="2" style="background:#F99;vertical-align:middle;text-align:center;" | Pro-rata: tax and penalty on earnings, basis tax- and penalty-free
| rowspan="2" style="background:#FFFF90;vertical-align:middle;text-align:center;" | Pro-rata: only tax on earnings
| style="background:#9F9;vertical-align:middle;text-align:center;" | Fully qualified
|-
! Five year holding period ''not met''
| style="background:#FFFF90;vertical-align:middle;text-align:center;" | Pro-rata: only tax on earnings
|-
|}

When the account contains IRRs, the rules are very complex,&lt;ref&gt;{{forum link| t=460229| title=&lt;nowiki&gt;[Wiki] Proposed new pages - Rule of 55, Early Withdrawal [and now "Retirement account at a former employer"]&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; and legal ambiguity exists. IRRs generally belong in the "basis" category with respect to the above pro-rata calculation, but the exact ordering between direct contributions and IRRs is determined by the plan rules. To make matters worse, plans are generally not required to populate Box 10 of [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1099r.pdf Form 1099-R] unless the distribution is taken under a [[Substantially equal periodic payments|SEPP]]. 

In either case, if the designed Roth account is not qualified, you are generally better off to first roll the money out into a Roth IRA and then take withdrawals from the Roth IRA, because Roth IRA distributions always order contributions and conversions/rollovers before earnings. This strategy also avoids the complex and error-prone calculations for distributions from the designated Roth account.

==After-tax 401(k)==
{{main|After-tax 401(k)}}

An employer may also allow you to make After-tax 401(k) contributions. These are the 401(k) equivalent of [[Non-deductible traditional IRA |non-deductible traditional IRA]] contributions, and if the 401(k) is rolled over they can be rolled directly to a Roth IRA. These are normally administered as a sub-account of the employee's 401(k) account. IRS rules allow employees to contribute up to 100% of compensation into an after-tax 401(k), up to the overall Section 415(c) limit for the plan. Employers usually limit after-tax contributions to a certain percentage of salary, but the limit is still often much higher than for pre-tax or Roth accounts. 

IRC Section 415(c)(1)(A) sets the total contribution limit for both employee and employer contributions to a 401(k), and is summarized in [https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/plan-participant-employee/retirement-topics-403b-contribution-limits Retirement Topics 403b Contribution Limits]. Therefore, the after-tax contribution limit is the remaining amount allowed after all employee and employer contributions. And for most people that can afford to contribute, it would allow them to save nearly twice as much money in tax-advantaged space as the combination of elective deferrals and employer contributions.

Just like [[non-deductible traditional IRA]] contributions, earnings are taxed upon withdrawal or conversion at ordinary income rates. Therefore, an after-tax 401(k) account is not great on its own; it's usually better to invest after-tax money in a [[taxable account]], so future growth will be taxed at lower long-term capital gains rates. But, an after-tax 401(k) is useful as an intermediary account, because funds can be rolled over into a [[#Roth_401(k)|Roth sub-account]] or out into a [[Roth IRA]], if the plan allows in-plan Roth rollovers or [[#In-service_distribution|in-service distributions]]. During either rollover, the basis (contributions) rolls over tax-free, and only the growth is taxable. If you are able to roll after-tax 401(k) money into a Roth account quickly, the growth will be minimal, and the overall transaction has the net effect of a Roth contribution. This process is called the [[Mega-backdoor Roth]]. For 401(k) plans with the necessary features, this process allows large Roth contributions in excess of the normal 401(k) limits.

==Plan loans==

Most major companies also offer a loan provision on their 401(k) plans that let you borrow against your account and repay yourself with interest. Restrictions will vary by company but most let you withdraw no more than 50 percent of your vested account value as a loan. You then repay the loan with interest, through deductions taken directly from your paychecks. You must repay the loan within five years unless you use it to buy your main home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/plan-sponsor/401k-resource-guide-plan-sponsors-general-distribution-rules| title=401k Resource Guide Plan Sponsors General Distribution Rules| publisher=IRS| accessdate=January 9, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to tax year 2018, you had a 60-day window on employment termination, to repay a 401(k) loan balance or rollover the loan balance to an eligible retirement account, in order to avoid the loan balance from being treated as a distribution. The 2017 tax reform (Tax Cuts and Jobs Act) extended the loan repayment and rollover window to the tax filing deadline (including the tax filing extension, if applicable) for tax years 2018 and later. Effectively, this increases the time that you have, to repay or rollover the loan balance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://sponsor.fidelity.com/bin-public/06_PSW_Website/documents/taxlawchanged-table.pdf| title=Recent Changes in Tax Laws Affect Qualified Retirement Plans and Health &amp; Welfare Benefits| publisher=Fidelity}}{{dead link}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.creditkarma.com/tax/i/401k-tax-reform-loan-repay| title=401(k) Tax Reform Equals More Time to Repay 401(k) Loans| publisher=Credit Karma| accessdate=January 9, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early withdrawals==
{{Main|Early withdrawal}}

Employer plans may allow early withdrawals under some circumstances, but whether the 10% early withdrawal penalty applies is governed by IRS rules. Plans are only required to allow withdrawals when you separate from service, become disabled, die, for [[Required Minimum Distribution|RMDs]], or if/when the plan terminates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.employeefiduciary.com/blog/401k-distribution-rules-frequently-asked-questions| title=401(k) Distribution Rules: Frequently Asked Questions for Employers and Employees| publisher=Employee Fiduciary| author=Eric Droblyen| date=May 6, 2025 |accessdate=September 1, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, many plans do not allow you to withdraw after you turn 59½ if you are still working, even though such withdrawals would be penalty-free. 

Early withdrawal penalties apply to withdrawals before you are age 59½ unless one of the exceptions apply. Some common exceptions are listed below. A complete list is available on the [[Early withdrawal|main page]].

*[[Rule of 55]] - if you separate from your employer in or after the year you turn 55
*A series of payments under a [[Substantially equal periodic payments|Substantially Equal Periodic Payments]] (SEPP) plan, useful for [[early retirement]]
*Qualified reservist distributions&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Qualified reservist distributions may be made to military reservists called up for at least 180 days, with no early withdrawal penalty. Reservists may re-contribute the amount of the qualified reservist distribution to an IRA in the 2 year period beginning the day after the end of their active duty. The extension of the repayment and rollover window is applicable to [[403(b)]] and [[457(b)]] plans, in addition to 401(k) plans.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Medical expenses
*Total and permanent disability
*Terminal illness
*Death

===Hardship distributions===
 
Plans ''may'', but are not required to, allow employees to withdraw money from plans for financial hardships, defined as an immediate and heavy financial need, and you are only allowed to withdraw the amount necessary to satisfy that need.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/plan-participant-employee/retirement-topics-hardship-distributions| title=Retirement topics - Hardship distributions| publisher=IRS| accessdate=August 27, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes hardships of your beneficiary under the plan.. Such withdrawals ''may be'' subject to early withdrawal penalties if one of the exceptions does not apply. 

==In-service distribution==
An '''in-service distribution''', also known as an in-service withdrawal or in-service rollover, is when a participant takes a rollover distribution from the plan while still employed at the company that is offering the plan.

IRS rules do not permit this for employees age 59½ or younger, for their elective employee pretax or Roth contributions; for participants age 59½ or older, a plan ''may'' allow it. A plan may, however, allow for in-service distributions of the employer matching contributions and of the employee's [[401(k)#After-tax_401.28k.29|after-tax 401(k)]] contributions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://thefinancebuff.com/in-service-withdrawal-the-law-and-the-plan-rules.html| title=In-Service Withdrawal: The Law and The Plan Rules| publisher=The Finance Buff| date=February 1, 2011| accessdate=January 9, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{forum link| t=50493 |title=In-service 401(k) rollover to IRA (under 40, still employed)| date=February 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rollovers==
{{Main|Retirement account at a former employer}}
{{See also|IRA rollovers and transfers}}

When your employment ends, you have the following options with the 401(k) at your previous employer. The [[Retirement account at a former employer|main article]] has more detail and discusses some less common situations. 

===Roll the money into your new employer's plan===

Potential advantages:
*Simplicity - you have one less account to keep track of, and [[rebalancing]] is easier
*Some employer plans have better investments than you can get in an IRA, or investments that could be uniquely valuable. See: [[Retirement_account_at_a_former_employer#Investments_in_employer_plans|Investments in employer plans]]
*Easier access:
**If you retire in the year you turn 55, you can access the money penalty-free by way of the [[Rule of 55]]
**If the new employer's plan has a plan loan feature, you can use this feature with rolled in money (whereas plan loans from accounts at a former employer are not allowed)
*If you work past [[Required Minimum Distribution]] (RMD) age, money in the new employer's plan is exempt from RMDs

Potential disadvantages:
*The new employer's plan may have undesirable fees and/or investment choices that are not ideal

===Roll the money into an IRA===

Potential advantages:
*It is easy to find [[IRA|IRAs]] with great investment choices and low fees
*The account is entirely under your control, so you avoid potential complications related to your employer, such as them adding fees or changing investment options, or problems with your account such as if the employer goes out of business.
*Unlike employer plans, you can withdraw money from an IRA at any time (although whether these withdrawals are subject to penalties and additional taxes is determined by [[Early withdrawal|IRS rules]]). 
**Although not common, if you want the ability to do [[Roth conversion|Roth conversions]] and your employer's plan does not allow In-Plan Roth Rollovers (IRRs), leaving pre-tax money in an IRA will allow this.
**The [[Roth IRA]] distribution rules are generally more favorable for early distributions than for designated Roth accounts, if you want to [[Early retirement|retire early]] or need money in an emergency.

Potential disadvantages:
*Any pre-tax money in a [[traditional IRA]] interferes with the [[Backdoor Roth IRA]] process. If you are a higher earner who needs to use the Backdoor Roth IRA process to contribute to a Roth IRA, this would make those contributions impossible.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;You could still execute the Backdoor Roth IRA process, but it would act more like a taxable [[Roth conversion]], which is probably not desirable if you are adding that taxable income on top of a high earned income.&lt;/ref&gt; This is ''not'' an issue for Roth money, as [[Roth IRA]] balances are not included in the pro-rata calculation.
*Money in an IRA foregoes potential benefits from an employer plan, such as Rule of 55, plan loans (if your employer's plan has this feature), and the suspension of RMDs if you work past RMD age. Whether these features are valuable to you depends on your individual situation.
*Money in an IRA generally gets less [[asset protection]] than money in an employer plan. Money in a Rollover IRA, if not commingled with other IRA money and with no direct contributions made into it, gets unlimited protection from bankruptcy at the federal level. Protection of an IRA against general creditor claims is at the state level, with some states offering limited or no protection. Money in an [[ERISA]] employer plan gets unlimited federal protection from both bankruptcy and creditor claims.
*There are plenty of unscrupulous salespeople (many of whom call themselves "financial advisors") who would love to sell you poor-quality fee-laden and/or high-risk investments in an IRA, such as loaded mutual funds, annuities, permanent life insurance, private investments, and others. The investment choices in employer plans, while possibly not ideal, at least protect against predatory salespeople and scams.

===Leave the money in the former employer's plan===

Potential advantages:
*If the new employer's plan is not good (or doesn't accept incoming rollovers) and you don't want to roll the money out into an IRA (for example, if you want to make Backdoor Roth IRA contributions), leaving money in the former employer's plan may be the best option
*If the plan has [[Retirement_account_at_a_former_employer#Investments_in_employer_plans|desirable investments]] compared to the new employer's plan or an IRA, it could be a benefit to leave the money inside

Potential disadvantages:
*You have one more account to keep track of and potentially forget about, and rebalancing is more difficult
*The former employer can forcibly roll money out of the plan into an IRA if the balance is less than $7,000, or forcibly distribute it if less than $1,000
*The former employer's plan may have undesirable fees and/or investment choices that are not ideal
*You cannot access the money by way of the Rule of 55 or plan loans after you separate
*The account will be subject to RMDs even if you are still working for your new employer at RMD age
*Although not common, investors sometimes have issues getting access to money in a former employer's plan, for example if the employer is bought out, goes out of business, etc.

===Take a distribution as cash===

This is usually advisable only if you need the money immediately and have no other sources to draw from, including taking a loan at reasonable terms. You will pay a 10% early distribution penalty if an [[Early withdrawal|exception]] does not apply. You will also owe taxes on the distribution, and Roth money withdrawn early may generate taxes that you would not pay if you waited until age 59½. In addition to these immediate taxes and penalties, you also forego the future benefits of retirement accounts, such as tax-deferred or tax-free growth, asset protection, and [[estate planning]] benefits.

==Involuntary cash out distributions==

A defined contribution plan may involuntarily cash out, also described as force out, the accounts of ex-employee participants with a balance of $7,000 or less.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/publications/p560| title=Publication 560 (2024), Retirement Plans for Small Business| publisher=IRS| accessdate=September 2, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt; This amount was increased from $5,000 in the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SECURE_2.0_Act SECURE 2.0 Act], effective January 1, 2024.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://keitercpa.com/blog/benefit-plan-5-reasons-leverage-secure-2-0-cashout-change/| title=Benefit Plan Insights: 5 Reasons to Leverage SECURE 2.0 Act’s Cashout Limit Change| publisher=Keiter CPAs| author=Rachel Gonner| date=April 18, 2024| accessdate=September 2, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the balance is between $1,000 and $7,000, then the employer must notify the participant and must provide for the automatic rollover to an [[IRA]] or annuity, unless the participant chooses otherwise. Balances of less than $1,000 may be distributed as cash/check to the participant; this will result in an [[401(k)#Early_withdrawals_and_loans|early withdrawal]] penalty and a taxable event.

A 401(k) plan is not ''required'' to make these distributions, but they ''may'', and many plans do so to reduce administrative costs of running the plans. Therefore, if you have 401(k) balances of $7,000 or less with former employers you should know the rules of your former plan(s) so you can manage your accounts successfully. If you have balances of $1,000 or less you must take extra care to monitor your accounts to ensure that they are not cashed out.

The best way to ensure a small-balance account is handled according to your investment goals is to roll the balance over to an IRA or to a new defined contribution plan (if applicable and if the plan accepts rollovers).

==Required Minimum Distributions==
{{Main|Required Minimum Distribution}}

You must begin making distributions from a traditional 401(k) at least no later than the year after the year you turn 73 unless you are still employed at the company sponsoring the 401(k) plan. The minimum RMD age increases to 75 in 2033. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://natlawreview.com/article/secure-20-series-part-3-retirement-plan-required-minimum-distribution-age-to?amp | title= SECURE 2.0 Series Part 3: Retirement Plan Required Minimum Distribution Age to Increase to 75 | publisher=National Law Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of the distribution is based on life expectancy according to the relevant factors from the [[IRA Distribution Tables | appropriate IRS tables]]. The only exception to minimum distribution is for people still working once they reach that age, and the exception only applies to the current plan they are participating in. There is a penalty for failing to make the minimum distribution. The penalty is 25% of the amount that should have been distributed, reduced to 10% if corrected within two years. Prior to 2024, RMDs were also required in Roth 401(k)s. Starting in 2024 and later years, RMDs are no longer required from designated Roth 401(k) and 403(b) accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/retirement-plan-and-ira-required-minimum-distributions-faqs#:~:text=Designated%20Roth%20accounts%20in%20a,required%20from%20designated%20Roth%20accounts | title= Retirement plan and IRA Required Minimum Distributions FAQs | publisher=Internal Revenue Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beneficiaries==

If you die while holding the plan, your designated beneficiaries may rollover their inherited balance to an IRA, which will be treated as an inherited IRA.

===Successor beneficiaries===
If the designated beneficiary stays in the plan, successor beneficiaries of the designated beneficiary may not rollover an inherited balance to an IRA, per Sec 402(c)(11). A 401(k) plan ''may'', however, choose to allow successor beneficiaries to stay in the plan, and take required minimum distribution requirements using the same schedule that the original designated beneficiary was using.&lt;ref&gt;{{forum link|p=2214160|title=TSP Beneficiary Account and Tax Burden to Successors|author=Alan S|date=October 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Expensive or mediocre choices==
Even in a bad 401(k), you should contribute up to the company match. Choose the lowest-cost funds; many bad 401(k)s have a few lower-cost funds. If you are eligible, additional contributions should usually go into a Roth or Traditional IRA. But unless your 401(k) is very bad and you expect to stay a very long time with the same employer, investing unmatched money in the 401(k) is likely to be better than taxable investing, because you can roll over your 401(k) to a low-cost IRA when you leave.

A reasonable rule-of-thumb is to consider investing in a taxable account if the product of the extra costs and the number of years you will stay in the plan exceeds one and a half times your combined federal and state tax rates on qualified dividends over your working career. That is, if you pay 1.70% expenses rather than 0.20%, and you pay 15% federal tax on qualified dividends, plus 5% state tax, you should still invest in the plan unless you are reasonably certain that you will stay with the employer for more than 20 years for a net loss of 30% (actually 26% because of compounding). If you pay no state tax, you should still invest in the plan unless you are reasonably certain you will stay more than 15 years.

The reason for the rule of thumb is that a long-term investment, even in a tax-efficient stock fund, is likely to lose more than your tax rate to taxes. You will pay tax every year on the dividends, continue to pay that tax after you leave the employer, and then pay capital-gains tax on most of the investment value when you sell the fund over the course of your retirement. (And if you retire in a 15% tax bracket and thus pay no capital gains on the fund sale, the lower tax bracket will also reduce the tax due on withdrawals from a 401(K), for a comparable tax savings.)&lt;ref group="note"&gt;[https://thefinancebuff.com/alternatives-to-a-high-cost-401k-or-403b-plan.html Alternatives to a High Cost 401(k) Or 403(b) Plan] at [https://thefinancebuff.com TheFinanceBuff.com] contains a spreadsheet which can be used to compare alternatives for your situation (July 23, 2008). The spreadsheet approximately agrees with the rule-of-thumb estimates for the common situation in which you have 20-30 years with the employer and then average about another 10 years in retirement.&lt;/ref&gt;

Now, before you consider forgoing your 401(k), you may want to talk to the human resources department to see if they can improve the 401(k) plan. You may want to suggest a low-cost plan like Employee Fiduciary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.employeefiduciary.com/| title=401(k) Plans for Small Businesses| publisher=Employee Fiduciary| accessdate=January 9, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt; You can find a sample letter to the human resources department at {{forum link| t=7573| title=401(k) links and suggestions}}. Keep in mind that the employer likely cares more about the cost of running the 401(k) plan than the expense ratios that the employees have to live with. For this reason, it is not a good idea to stress the problem with the expense ratios too much. (See [[How to campaign for a better 401(k) plan]] for more details, as well as [https://thefinancebuff.com/alternatives-to-a-high-cost-401k-or-403b-plan.html Alternatives to a High Cost 401(k) Or 403(b) Plan] for more guidance).

==Employer administration==
===Investment policy statements===
Employers are expected to have investment policy statements for the plan, governing the process by which investment selections are chosen and monitored on an ongoing basis.

===Timing of contributions===
Contributions deferred from an employee's pay must be contributed to the 401(k) plan and allocated to your account "as of the earliest date" the deferrals can be segregated from the employer's assets. According to Department of Labor regulation 2510.3-102, the "earliest date" is the earlier of (1) the first date reasonably practicable on an ongoing basis based on the routine processing of the payroll information, transmittal of data to the plan provider and processing by the provider or (2) the 15th business day of the month following the month in which the contribution was withheld from the employee's pay. Employers are violating ERISA and subject to 15% tax on the deemed interest when failing to contribute timely.

===Plan financial reports===
Plan financial reports are filed on form 5500, 5500-C or 5500-R. Some of the information from these reports must be made available to employees, often on the company intranet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://institutional.vanguard.com/iam/pdf/RBA_052008_01.pdf| title=Regulatory Brief: Update on Plan Fee Disclosure| publisher=Vanguard| date=May 2008| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110818142722/https://institutional.vanguard.com/iam/pdf/RBA_052008_01.pdf| archive-date=August 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{for|a full discussion|wikipedia:Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974}}

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' (ERISA) is a 1974 US federal law that sets minimum standards for most voluntarily established pension and health plans in private industry to provide protection for individuals in these plans.

ERISA requires plans to provide participants with plan information including important information about plan features and funding; sets minimum standards for participation, vesting, benefit accrual and funding; provides fiduciary responsibilities for those who manage and control plan assets; requires plans to establish a grievance and appeals process for participants to get benefits from their plans; gives participants the right to sue for benefits and breaches of fiduciary duty; and, if a [[defined benefit pension plan|defined benefit plan]] is terminated, guarantees payment of certain benefits through a federally chartered corporation, known as the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC).

In general, ERISA does not cover retirement plans established or maintained by governmental entities, churches for their employees, or plans which are maintained solely to comply with applicable workers compensation, unemployment or disability laws. ERISA also does not cover plans maintained outside the United States primarily for the benefit of nonresident aliens or unfunded excess benefit plans.

A '''Collective Investment Trust (CIT)''' is  a pooled group of trust accounts operated by a trust company or a bank. [https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/investing-basics/glossary/collective-investment-trust-cit Collective Investment Trusts] combine the assets of various individuals and organizations to create a larger, well-diversified portfolio.&lt;ref name= "Definition"&gt; [http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/collective-investment-fund.asp#ixzz1qFuY0XNe definition], investopedia&lt;/ref&gt; Many individual employees encounter CITs through their investment in employer provided contributory retirement plans. CITs tend to have lower expenses compared to mutual funds and are less regulated.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.yalelawjournal.org/essay/overtaking-mutual-funds-the-hidden-rise-and-risk-of-collective-investment-trusts Yale Law Journal - Overtaking Mutual Funds: The Hidden Rise and Risk of Collective Investment Trusts]&lt;/ref&gt;  As of 2024, over 50% of all target date funds, a popular  employer retirement plan option, are invested in CITs.&lt;ref&gt;[https://marketing.morningstar.com/content/cs-assets/v3/assets/blt9415ea4cc4157833/bltd2006cbdc6c250c8/683a0a55b705e0691463f1a4/Target-Date_Landscape_2025_(2).pdf Morningstar - 2025 Target-Date Fund Landscape]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.morningstar.com/business/insights/research/tdf-landscape 2025 Target-Date Fund Investment Strategy]&lt;/ref&gt; There are two types of CITs:

* '''A1 Fund''': A fund of grouped assets contributed by either the holding bank or affiliated banks for the exclusive purpose of investment and reinvestment. These funds are usually called Collective Investment Funds.
* '''A2 Fund''': A fund of grouped assets contributed by pension, profit sharing, retirement, or other trusts that are exempt from federal income tax. This is the plan type that most employees encounter with company retirement plans.&lt;ref name="Definition"/&gt; 

CITs are not regulated by the Investment Company Act of 1940 but are regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”) and subject to oversight by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and the Department of Labor (“DOL”).&lt;ref name= "Re-Emergence"&gt;[https://www.manning-napier.com/Portals/0/ArticlesFiles/Article_20120501013931.pdf  The Re-Emergence of Collective Investment Trust Funds], Manning &amp; Napier, June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Collective investment trusts 2000-2022.jpg|right|550px|Figure 1.CIT growth. Source: [https://crr.bc.edu/this-investment-is-cheaper-and-better-than-mutual-funds/ This Investment Is Cheaper and Better than Mutual Funds – Center for Retirement Research], December 3, 2024.]]
CITs date back to 1927. In 1936 Congress amended the Internal Revenue Service Code to provide tax-exempt status to certain bank CITS. In 1955 the Federal Reserve authorized banks to combine funds from pensions, profit sharing and stock bonus plans and the IRS determined that such funds could be exempt from tax. As a result, CITs became the popular choice for defined benefit plans. In 2000 the National Securities Clearing Corporation added CITs to its mutual fund trading platform, allowing CITs to trade daily and as fluidly as mutual funds.&lt;ref name= "Re-Emergence"/&gt; As a result, CITs have become a larger component of the defined contribution plan product menu (see Figure 1).&lt;ref&gt;[https://crr.bc.edu/this-investment-is-cheaper-and-better-than-mutual-funds/ CENTER for RETIREMENT RESEARCH at BOSTON COLLEGE -This Investment Is Cheaper and Better than Mutual Funds]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegram.com/article/20100321/NEWS/3210555/1002/RSS01&amp;source=rss Low-fee collective investment trusts may be coming to 401(k)], News telegram.com (March 10, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;  According to another source, as of 2022, CITs accounted for 43% of all 401(k) plan assets and 59% of employer plans over $1 billion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ici.org/system/files/2025-03/25-rpt-dcplan-profile22-401k.pdf The BrightScope/ICI Defined Contribution Plan Profile: A Close Look at 401(k) Plans, 2022, page 36]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Qualifying plans==

The following pension plans are eligible to invest in CITs:
:#Qualified 401(k) plans
:#Qualified profit sharing plans
:#Qualified stock bonus plans
:#Qualified pension plans
:#401(a) government plans
:#457(b) government plans
:#Certain separate accounts and contracts of insurance companies&lt;ref name= "Re-Emergence"/&gt;

==CIT special characteristics==
CITs have a number of special characteristics:
:'''Costs'''. Because CITs are only offered to large institutional accounts, do not deal with retail investors, and have lower regulatory costs than do mutual funds, they generally have lower costs. According to a 2020 asset manager fee survey, the total expense ratio of CITs was lower than mutual funds in several categories.&lt;ref&gt; [https://www.ssga.com/content/dam/ssmp/library-content/pdfs/dc/collective-investment-trusts-lower-costs-greater-flexibility.pdf SSGA - Collective Investment Trusts Lower Costs, Greater Flexibility], SSGA 4/2023 which sources the data from &lt;br&gt;Mercer Global Asset Manager Fee Survey 2020.&lt;/ref&gt;

:{| class="wikitable"

|-
|US Large-Cap Core || 0.40% || 0.65%
|-
|International Equity || 0.60% || 0.75%
|}

:'''Reporting requirements'''. The CIT spells out the terms and guidelines under which the investments of the trust are managed in a Declaration of Trust (a mutual fund uses a prospectus). There are no annual or semiannual reports. Unlike a mutual fund, a CIT has no ticker designation. In addition, while Morningstar provides a proprietary database of CIT performance data for more than 1000 US collective trusts, this service is only made available to institutional investors, consultants, retirement plan sponsors, endowments, and foundations and is not available to individual investors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://corporate.morningstar.com/us/asp/subject.aspx?xmlfile=2810.xml Collective Investment Trust Database - Overview], Morningstar&lt;/ref&gt; The company contributory plan will usually provide the planholder with factsheet disclosure and performance information.&lt;ref&gt; Here is an actual factsheet disclosure document, [http://www.schwabbankfunds.com/cms/P-4439216.2/SIRT_factsheets_4Q11.pdf?cmsid=P-4439216&amp;cv12 Schwab CIT Factsheet], 12/31/2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

:'''Dividend reinvestment'''. A CIT does not make dividend distributions. Dividends are added and accumulate in the [[Net asset value| net asset value]] of a CIT share.

{{for|additional information|wikipedia:403(b)}}

The '''403(b)''' is a tax deferred, defined contribution plan available to [[403b plans for K-12 public school district employees|employees of educational institutions such as public school districts]] and certain (Internal Revenue Code section) 501(c)(3) non-profit groups, which include colleges, universities, hospitals, charities and the clergy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irs.gov/publications/p571/index.html  IRS Publication 571 Tax-Sheltered Annuity Plans(403(b)Plans)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plan basics==
Contributions to a 403(b) plan are tax-deductible, and any earnings accumulate tax-free until withdrawals are made. Withdrawals are taxed at ordinary income rates, and a 10% penalty tax is assessed on withdrawals made prior to the age of 59 ½.  In 2026, catch-up contributions must be made to a Roth account if the employee's 2025 salary was more than $150,000.

Employees may contribute up to 100% of their salaries, subject to the following limits:

{{Retirement Plan Contribution Limits}}
===Roth 403(b)===

Beginning in 2006, 403(b) plans have been allowed the option of providing a Roth 403(b).  The Roth 403(b) allows individuals to contribute after-tax dollars to grow tax free and, generally, not be taxed upon withdrawal.&lt;ref group="note"&gt; A qualified Roth 403(b) distribution is generally a distribution that is made after a 5-taxable-year period of participation and is either:
#made on or after the date you attain age 59½
#made after your death, or
#attributable to your being disabled.
When you roll over a distribution from a designated Roth account to a Roth IRA, the period that the rolled-over funds were in the designated Roth account '''does not count''' toward the 5-taxable-year period for determining qualified distributions from the Roth IRA. However, if you had contributed to any Roth IRA in a prior year, the 5-taxable-year period for determining qualified distributions from a Roth IRA is measured from the earlier contribution. So, if the earlier contribution was made more than 5 years ago and you are over 59 ½ a distribution of amounts attributable to a rollover contribution from a designated Roth account would be a qualified distribution from the Roth IRA.&lt;br&gt;
If you take a distribution from your designated Roth account before the end of the 5-taxable-year period, it is a nonqualified distribution. You must include the earnings portion of the nonqualified distribution in gross income. However, the basis (or contributions) portion of the nonqualified distribution is not included in gross income. The basis portion of the distribution is determined by multiplying the amount of the nonqualified distribution by the ratio of designated Roth contributions to the total designated Roth account balance.&lt;br&gt; 
For example, if a nonqualified distribution of $5,000 is made from your designated Roth account when the account consists of $9,400 of designated Roth contributions and $600 of earnings, the distribution consists of $4,700 of designated Roth contributions (that are not includible in your gross income) and $300 of earnings (that are includible in your gross income). See [http://www.irs.gov/Retirement-Plans/Retirement-Plans-FAQs-on-Designated-Roth-Accounts#distns FAQ's on Designated Roth Accounts], IRS. &lt;/ref&gt;
If the plan contains a Roth option, an employee can direct 403(b) contributions to a regular 403(b), a Roth 403(b), or some combination of the two plans; the total contribution cannot exceed the annual contribution limit.&lt;ref name="FAQ"&gt;[http://www.403bwise.com/participants/getwise_faq.html 403bwise FAQ]&lt;/ref&gt;

A Roth 403(b) is no longer subject to required minimum distributions during the owner's lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irs.gov/Retirement-Plans/Retirement-Plans-FAQs-regarding-Required-Minimum-Distributions Retirement Plans FAQs regarding Required Minimum Distributions], IRS &lt;/ref&gt;

A Roth 403(b) may be attractive under the following circumstances:
* If you expect your tax rate in retirement will be higher than it had been during the years you contributed.
* If you are young and want to use a long investment horizon to accumulate tax-free earnings under a Roth feature.
* If you are a highly compensated individual who would like to have a pool of tax-free money to draw upon after retirement, and who are not eligible for Roth IRAs due to the income limitations.
* If you want to leave tax-free money to heirs.

===Fifteen year rule===

Employees with 15 or more years of service with public school systems, hospitals, home health service agencies, health and welfare agencies, churches, or convention or associations of churches may be able to qualify for a Salary Reduction Catch-Up.  This option is only available to those whose prior contributions have averaged less than $5,000 per year.  If this qualification is met, the employee may be able to defer an extra $3,000 per annum in catch-up contributions (to a lifetime maximum of $15,000).&lt;ref name="FAQ"/&gt; In the ordering of contributions, the IRS deems that the 15 year service catch-up contributions precede the age 50 catch-up contributions.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.403bwise.com/participants/getwise_faq.html#faq28 How much can be contributed to a 403(b)], 403(b)wise.com, FAQ &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt; For detailed rules regarding the Fifteen Year Rule consult [http://www.irs.gov/publications/p571/ch04.html#en_US_201212_publink1000239675 Publication 571] '' Tax Sheltered Annuity Plans (403(b)Plans)'', IRS &lt;/ref&gt; 

{| class="wikitable"
|''Example'':
Andrea Miller, age 51, makes a $22,500 contribution to her 403(b) plan in 2016. The IRS allocates the contribution as follows:
* Regular contribution : $18,000
* 15 year service catch-up: $3,000
* Over 50 catch-up: $1,500
Andrea Miller's remaining lifetime 15 year service catch-up total is reduced to $12,000.
|}

===Distributions===
Basic rules regarding distributions from a 403(b) plan include:

* A withdrawal of assets prior to age 59-1/2, will be taxable at income tax rates and will result in the IRS imposing a 10 percent penalty tax (unless certain criteria are met.)&lt;ref group="note"&gt; Withdrawals are taxable unless you meet one of the following exclusions:
*Attain age 59-1/2
*Separate from service in or after the year in which you reach age 55
*Part of a series of substantially equal periodic payments for your life or the joint lives of you and your designated beneficiary
*Hardship
*Disability
*Death
*Made due to an IRS levy upon your participant account
*Paid to an alternative payee under a qualified domestic relations order
*Is a qualified reservist distribution as defined under the Pension Protection Act of 2006
*Is a payment of qualified medical expenses greater than 7.2% of your adjusted gross income. 
Source: [http://www.403bwise.com/participants/getwise_faq.html 403bwise FAQ] &lt;/ref&gt;

* Penalty-free withdrawals are allowed upon retirement (assumed to be in or after the year in which you reach age 55).&lt;ref name="FAQ"/&gt;
* Generally, required minimum distributions, must begin from a 403(b) no later than April 1 of the year following the year in which an individual turns age 73. If you are still working, you can delay withdrawal from your 403(b) until April 1 following the year in which you retire.&lt;ref name="FAQ"/&gt;
* 403(b) account balances that existed on December 31, 1986 are not subject to the age 70-1/2 distribution requirement. However, any earnings on that balance are. Distribution from the 12/31/86 balance needs to start at age 75. (This situation is complex, and consulting a professional tax advisor is recommended.)&lt;ref name="FAQ"/&gt;

If you own more than one 403(b), required minimum distributions are calculated in a manner similar to an IRA. You must calculate the RMD separately for each 403(b) contract that you own, but can take the total amount from one or more of the 403(b) contracts.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;This is similar to an IRA, where an IRA owner must calculate the RMD separately for each IRA that they own, but can withdraw the total amount from one or more of the IRAs. However, RMDs required from other types of retirement plans, such as 401(k) and 457(b) plans have to be taken separately from each of those plan accounts. Reference: [http://www.irs.gov/Retirement-Plans/Retirement-Plans-FAQs-regarding-Required-Minimum-Distributions#5 Retirement Plans FAQs regarding Required Minimum Distributions], from the IRS.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transfers===
{{401k rollover infobox}}
A number of tax-free transfers and rollovers of 403(b) plans are permissible under the tax laws.

* '''Contract exchanges'''.   If you transfer all or part of your interest from a 403(b) contract to another 403(b) contract (held in the same plan), the transfer is tax free, and is referred to as a contract exchange. This was previously known as a 90-24 transfer. A contract exchange is similar to a 90-24 transfer with one major difference. Previously, you were able to accomplish the transfer without your employer’s involvement. After September 24, 2007, all such transfers are accomplished through a contract exchange requiring your employer’s involvement. In addition, the plan must provide for the exchange and the transferred interest must be subject to the same or stricter distribution restrictions. Finally, your accumulated benefit after the exchange must be equal to what it was before the exchange.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irs.gov/publications/p571/ch08.html#en_US_201212_publink1000239748 IRS Pub 571]&lt;/ref&gt;
* If you leave your employer assets can be transferred to your new employer's defined contribution plan, if permitted by that plan.&lt;ref name="FAQ"/&gt;
* After leaving your employer, assets may be moved to a Rollover Individual Retirement Account (IRA).&lt;ref name="FAQ"/&gt;

==Advantages==
The advantages a 403(b) plan offers include the following.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.investopedia.com/articles/retirement/10/top-9-benefits-403b-plans.asp Top 9 Benefits Of A 403(b) plan], Eric Fontinelle, (April 6, 2010), investipedia &lt;/ref&gt;

* High contribution limits allow an individual to tax defer more investment dollars than can be contributed to individual retirement plans.
* Contributions to a regular 403(b) are tax deductible. Tax deductible contributions are especially advantageous if the tax rate is lower when retirement income withdrawals are made. If a Roth option is available, contributions made at low tax rates are advantageous if the tax rate is higher when retirement withdrawals are made.
* Contributions made to a 403(b) qualify for the Retirement Savings Contributions Credit ([[Saver's credit|Saver's Credit]]) if you meet the filing and income requirements.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.irs.gov/publications/p571/ch10.html Retirement Savings Contributions Credit (Saver's Credit)], Publication 571, IRS &lt;/ref&gt; 
* Employer's can make [[Employer matching contributions|matching contributions]] to employee contributions.
* Some plans may have loan provisions.&lt;ref group="note"&gt; IRS stipulations regarding 403(b)loans limits loans to the lesser of:
*$50,000
*One half of account value
The individual vendor may put additional restrictions on loan provisions. See [http://403bwise.com/participants/getwise_403b_access.html assessing 403(b)savings],  403(b)wise.com &lt;/ref&gt;
* If a 403(b) plan offers very low-cost investment options (such as those offered by [[TIAA-CREF]] in the university retirement plan market, or by a low cost mutual fund company) investors can reap most of the returns investment markets provide. Unfortunately, the 403(b) marketplace, especially in the K-12 school environment, is primarily populated by high cost, commissioned annuity products.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.403bwise.com/participants/getwise_reading.html must reads], 403(b)wise.com. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; ''[http://www.403bwise.com/pdf/who_is_watching_door_full.pdf Whose Watching The Door? How Controlling Provider Access Can Improve K-12 Teacher Retirement Outcomes]'', Research Dialogue, Issue No,. 98, TIAA-CREF Institute &lt;/ref&gt;
* 403(b) plans allow employees who have fifteen years of service to an employer to make up to $15,000 of catch up contributions to the plan.
* Participants who are eligible for both a 403(b) and a [[457(b)|457(b)]] through their employer can contribute the maximum of both plans, which at $23,000 each is a combined $46,000.&lt;ref group="note"&gt; See [http://www.457bwise.com/faqs/index.html#contributeboth 457(b)wise] FAQ for more information on 457(b) plans &lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
[[File:Fees-impact-return.gif|thumb|right|450px|Value after 35 years, assuming $250 contributed monthly with an 8 percent average annual return.]]
Since the 403(b) is heavily tied to the insurance industry,&lt;ref group="note"&gt; '''History of the 403(b) Plan'''
*403(b) programs were originally created in 1958 by Congress for employees of tax-exempt corporations. 
*In 1961, public education institutions, including public school districts, became eligible to offer 403(b) plans. 
*In 1973, Congress passed a law allowing employees to make tax-free exchanges of the full account value from one 403(b) plan to another, and partial transfers have been allowed since 1992. 
*In 1974, Congress passed the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), which included a provision allowing 403(b) plans to increase the number of their investment options and offer mutual funds in addition to annuities. 
*In 1978, a law was passed allowing employees to roll 403(b) assets into a traditional IRA. 
*Starting in 1982, with the passage of the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act, 403(b) participants were allowed to take loans from their plans. Additionally, religious organizations were permitted to set up Retirement Income Accounts, a specialized form of 403(b) plan. 
*In 1986, another tax law imposed restrictions on withdrawals before age 59½ and made them subject to a 10 percent early withdrawal penalty. Additionally, required minimum distributions (after age 70½) were established along with new limits on elective deferrals. The limit established then, $9,500 per person per year, remained in effect until 1998. 
*A 1992 IRS ruling allowed employees to make tax-free full or partial account transfers from annuities to 403(b)(7) mutual fund accounts. 
*The 2001 tax bill, which took effect in 2002, allowed 403(b) participants to roll their money into a 401(k) or governmental 457 plan when changing jobs, in addition to an IRA or other 403(b). Similarly, employees with savings in 401(k) or governmental 457 plans may roll their contributions into a 403(b) plan, if offered by their new employer. The tax bill also simplified the formula used to calculate an employee's annual contribution limit. 
* On July 23, 2007, the IRS finalized new regulations (set to go into full effect January 1, 2009) for public 403(b) retirement plans. The main highlights include:
** Requirement that a 403(b) program be maintained pursuant to a written plan which satisfies section 403(b) in both form and operation and contains all the terms and conditions for eligibility, limitations, and benefits under the plan.
** End to traditional 90-24 outside-of-plan transfers.
** Requirement to provide annual notification of eligibility
** Clarification of universal availability
** New information sharing requirements between employers and vendors.

These products often come with an extra layer of fees and restrictions such as surrender charges;&lt;ref group="note"&gt; According to the SEC [http://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/teacheroptions.htm Evaluating Your Retirement Options]:{{blockquote| 
For example, if you withdraw money from a variable annuity within a certain period after a purchase payment (typically within six to eight years, but sometimes as long as ten years), the insurance company usually will assess a "surrender" charge. A surrender charge is a type of sales charge that compensates the financial professional who sold the variable annuity to you. Generally, the surrender charge is a percentage of the amount you sell or exchange, and it will decline gradually over a period of several years, known as the "surrender period." For example, a 7% charge might apply in the first year after a purchase payment, 6% in the second year, 5% in the third year, and so on until the eighth year, when the surrender charge no longer applies. Some variable annuity contracts will allow you to withdraw part of your account value each year — 10% or 15% of your account value, for example — without paying a surrender charge.}}&lt;/ref&gt; furthermore, the extra tax-deferral features of the annuity are unnecessary since the 403(b) is already a tax-deferred account.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.403bwise.com/participants/getwise_investment_annuities.html Investment Basics: Why Annuities Rarely Make Sense in a 403(b)], 403(b)wise.com. &lt;/ref&gt;

Mutual funds are a possible option (known as 403(b)(7) custodial accounts) only if they are an available option within the plan. If mutual funds are not available in the 403(b) the participant should consider lobbying the employer to offer some lower fee mutual funds. If you are in this situation see [[How to campaign for a better 403(b) plan]] for information on how to proceed.

      <text bytes="14378" sha1="cyrk5dbgenr9qdau356san0xk25c4u3" xml:space="preserve">After retiring or leaving an employer, you may need to make the choice between a '''lump sum payout''' or a '''defined benefit pension'''. This article is intended to help you make such a decision. There are many factors to consider, and for each person the choice is personal, and depends on their circumstances.

== Background ==
A [[defined benefit pension plan]] provides a stream of income that is paid for the remainder of your life. There may be a survivor benefit that pays some percentage to a surviving spouse. On the death of both spouses, payments end, and there is no residual value.

A defined benefit pension plan is essentially the same thing as a simple annuity. You can use your own money (lump sum) to purchase a [[Immediate fixed annuity|single premium immediate annuity]] (SPIA) which, in its simplest form, pays you an income for the rest of your life. When you die, the payments stop and there is no residual value. SPIAs can have survivor benefits. A single premium deferred annuity (SPDA) involves purchase with a lump sum now, but with payments to begin at some future date. If you die before payments begin, there is no benefit.

There are many, many variations and additions to these options. For example, term certain provisions guarantee payments for some period, whether death intervenes or not. Others guarantee at least payment of the original lump sum used to purchase an annuity.

Pensions and annuities differ in how they are regulated and how they are taxed, particularly by the States. Also, they have different guarantee systems against bankruptcy or failure of the provider.

== Inflation ==
A stream of payments that increases with [[Consumer price index|inflation]] is said to be “real”. If the dollar payment amount is fixed, it is said to be “nominal”. Many government pensions are real, indexed for inflation. In the private sector, pensions are usually nominal, with no inflation adjustment. [[Social Security]] (SS) payments are indexed for inflation.

Annuities may be purchased as real or nominal, or even with a fixed yearly increase that does not depend on inflation. Deferred annuities may have inflation protection that begins only after payments start, with no protection during the waiting period.

Inflation protection is expensive to purchase, and it cannot be leveraged. Your investments in [[Treasury Inflation Protected Securities|TIPS]] (or [[Gold|gold]], or whatever) do not protect your other assets against inflation. For pension or annuity income, a “ladder” might be a good idea. Suppose a $100,000 investment will, today, pay $4,000 real or $7,000 nominal per year. A choice might be to pay 4/7, or $51,000, to get $4,000 of nominal income and invest the remaining $49,000. In a few years, buy another nominal annuity to compensate for actual inflation. Of course, you will also be assuming the risk of interest rate changes in the price of annuities, but you will also have a much better idea of your actual spending needs.

== Typical choices ==
On retirement, an employee has a choice of a pension (“annuitization”) or a lump sum, or a mix of both. This choice is common in public sector pensions in the USA. The choice is often “fair”. (See below.)

After retirement, a retiree is given a choice to take a lump sum instead of their existing pension. These offers are now common in private industry. They are usually not “fair”.

An ex-employee is offered a lump sum now or a pension at some future retirement age. These offers are usually fair, but often not significant in the total picture.

== Related choices ==
*Delay Social Security. Delaying your claim on Social Security is the same as purchasing a real annuity with joint survivorship. For most people, this is an exceedingly good deal.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;If you delay starting your retirement or old-age benefit past FRA (Full Retirement Age), you earn Delayed Retirement Credits and get a larger benefit. Wife, husband, widow, and widower benefits are also reduced if started before FRA (using different formulas), but do not increase if you wait past FRA to start. For more, see this SSA table: [http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/ProgData/ar_drc.html Early or delayed retirement]. Also see: [[Social Security#Planning Social Security benefits|Planning Social Security benefits]].&lt;/ref&gt;
*Buy an annuity. If you have a lump sum, you can buy an annuity of your choice. This is not very different from being presented with the choices above.

== Do you have a “fair” choice? ==
The question of a fair choice is, “Will my lump sum buy my offered pension or annuity?”

For nominal annuities, you can evaluate this at [https://www.immediateannuities.com/ ImmediateAnnuities.com].

Private companies that offer pension buyouts use a mandated formula that has little to do with the market value of the pension or annuity. These are generally not fair deals. Often, the lump sum falls 50% short of the market amount needed to buy the pension. 

The first step is to evaluate the extent to which you have a fair choice. Are your lump sum and pension / annuity choices interchangeable in terms of value?

As of July 2020, for a 65-year old male, a nominal annuity will pay about 5.9% with no survivor benefit. In other words, $100,000 in an annuity will pay back about $5,900 per year, for life, according to [https://www.immediateannuities.com/ ImmediateAnnuities.com]. This is ''not'' the same as earning 5.9% on an investment. With an investment, you get the earnings ''and'' the initial investment. With an annuity, the initial investment is gone and you receive only the annual benefits.

A real annuity (which is hard to find) will pay back less than a comparable nominal annuity to start, then increase according to some formula. To evaluate taking or delaying Social Security, consider [https://opensocialsecurity.com/ Open Social Security]. This calculator is particularly useful for couples, but it can also evaluate choices for a single.

When evaluating your options be careful to ensure that you are considering the same factors such as age, sex, and single or joint survivor benefits when comparing your possible pension and annuity choices.

If you want to use assumptions on longevity or investment return different from actuarial or mandated formulas, spreadsheet calculations can be done. For examples, see
* Three ways to evaluate "pension now" vs. "pension later", or
* Comparison of immediate Lump Sum pension vs. immediate annual payments (including COLA option)
on the 'Misc. calcs' tab of [http://forum.mrmoneymustache.com/forum-information-faqs/case-study-spreadsheet-updates/ The MMM Case Study Spreadsheet]. Another good approach is shown in {{forum link| p=3576209| title=Another Pension Lump Sum Help Needed}}.

== What am I choosing? ==
A pension or simple annuity is an income stream for life. You get the income no matter how long you live, but after you die there is nothing.

The lump sum is just that. You get it now, and it is up to you to manage it for the rest of your life.

It is very important to understand that a pension or annuity is an insurance product. It pays a good benefit because you may die early. If you live longer, you get paid the good benefit because others have died earlier than you.

For a 65-year old in the USA, life expectancy is about age 83. If you die before that age, it is too bad for you. If you live longer, you are benefiting from the fact that others of your cohort have died before you. A pension or annuity provides “mortality credits” or insurance against living a long life. Such insurance is almost impossible to obtain in any other way. This basic idea is exploited by a “[[wikipedia:Tontine|Tontine]]”. Some people worry that if they choose an annuity, they may die before they get their money back. That is exactly how it is supposed to work. Those who live longer benefit from payments that would have gone to those who died earlier.

Annuities that have a term certain or some other form of minimum payment guarantee address this concern. They may guarantee payments for some term of years, or guarantee to return your original purchase amount. This is done by adding some amount of term life insurance to your annuity. So, you have supplemented your insurance against living a long time with insurance against living a shorter time.

Choosing the pension at retirement is a choice that you cannot change. However, taking the lump sum does not prevent you from buying an SPIA later so in this sense the lump sum is more "flexible". The lump sum is also more flexible in terms of choosing your interest rate for long term annuitization. For example, given current low interest rates, you may choose to delay purchasing an annuity for a few years.

The lump sum choice requires having the discipline to manage it for 30 years or more. Many windfall recipients mismanage their wealth and end up in worse financial condition than before the windfall. For more on this, see: [[Managing a windfall]].

You also need to consider taxes and fees. Pensions are usually taxed as ordinary income, while the capital gains and dividends from an invested lump sum may be taxed at lower rates. Personal strategies to delay a claim on Social Security or to convert traditional IRAs to Roths also come into play.

== Provider risk ==
If you have a pension, there is a risk that the providing company or government unit may fail to provide the expected benefit. Public pensions are often not insured or guaranteed, and are often under-funded although benefits are protected to varying degrees by law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://crr.bc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/slp_25.pdf| title=Legal Constraints on Changes in State and Local Pensions| date=August 2012| accessdate=July 2, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt; Private pensions are often insured by the PBGC, though certain executive pension perks are not. Your benefit from the PBGC depends on your age when the company plan fails, not your age at retirement. If you are younger than age 65, there may be a significant penalty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.pbgc.gov/about/faq/pg/general-faqs-about-pbgc| title=General FAQs About PBGC| publisher=Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation| accessdate=July 2, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Some companies provide incentives for retirement at age 62 or earlier that are not covered by the PBGC.)

If you have an annuity, there is a risk that the providing insurance company may fail. Annuities are guaranteed by the insurance industry according to laws that vary by each State.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.annuityadvantage.com/resources/state-guaranty-associations/| title=Life &amp; Health Guaranty Associations| publisher=AnnuityAdvantage| accessdate=July 2, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are not guaranteed by the States, and the amount of the guarantee is quite low. (What is guaranteed is the current net present value of the annuity, with limits in the low six figures.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.nolhga.com/policyholderinfo/main.cfm/location/insolvencyprocess| title=What Happens When an Insurance Company Fails?| publisher=National Organization of Life &amp; Health Insurance Guaranty Associations| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240704165529/https://www.nolhga.com/policyholderinfo/main.cfm/location/insolvencyprocess| archive-date=July 4, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If you take the lump sum, you become the provider. This represents a huge transfer of risk from the plan sponsor to the individual (the risk of pension failure is minuscule in comparison). Be sure to understand the risk of investing on your own before making any other decisions.

== A framework for a decision ==
Many advisors suggest that, in retirement, you should try to assure an income stream that meets your minimum needs. See Michael J. Zwecher,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Michael J. Zwecher| title=Retirement Portfolios| publisher=Wiley| date=2010| isbn=978-0-470-55681-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Bernstein]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=William Bernstein| author-link=William Bernstein| title=The Ages of the Investor: A Critical Look at Life-cycle Investing| publisher=CreateSpace| date=2012| isbn=978-1-4782-2713-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Jim C. Otar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Jim C. Otar| title=Unveiling the Retirement Myth| date=2009| isbn=978-0-9689634-2-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Obviously, a pension or annuity can contribute to that income stream.

As suggested above, the best way to buy an income stream is to delay your claim on Social Security. If the lump sum will enable you to delay that SS claim, consider taking it. You may have other pensions that do not have a lump sum option that will contribute to your retirement income.

If you then still need retirement income, you must consider whether to take the offered pension or annuity, or whether you believe you can do “better” with the lump sum by yourself.

== Step by step ==
#Is your offer a fair deal? In other words, can your offered lump sum buy the pension?
#Have you considered delaying your claim on Social Security, and how might this lump sum enable you to do so?
#What is your opinion on your own mortality? Do you want to plan beyond a life expectancy of 83 years?
#What do you think of the viability of the provider, be it your company for your pension, your insurer for your annuity, or the Federal Government for Social Security?
#Have you considered and planned for the income streams you will need in retirement?
#Do you think you can do better with a lump sum by investing it yourself? Better than a guaranteed income stream for the rest of your life?

'''Employer matching contributions''' are for employees participating in a defined contribution plan like a [[401(k)]], [[403(b)]] or [[Thrift Savings Plan]] (TSP)) and who may be eligible for an employer match on their contributions. Companies use a variety of matching rules and formulas, so it is imperative that you verify the exact rules of your employer's plan. Although plan rules vary, this page attempts to outline some common themes and best practices.

Contributing to an employer plan and getting the match is usually the [[Prioritizing investments|best investment]] anyone can make, and so should be a top financial priority.

== Strategies to achieve the maximum match ==
Plan participants are regularly encouraged to contribute to the plan at least up to the point where they can gain the maximum match to which they are entitled.

In most cases, gaining the match can be as straightforward as contributing a certain percentage all year. For example, if your employer matches 50% of your contributions up to 6% of your salary, then if you regularly contribute 6% of your $100,000 salary all year, you will gain a $3,000 match on your $6,000 of contributions.

In this example, a couple of scenarios could cause you to miss out on the maximum match:

=== Skipping contributions ===
Suppose you have a $100,000 salary and do not contribute for the first six months of the year, but in the last six months you contribute $1,000 per month for a total of $6,000 – the same total contribution amount as if you had contributed 6% each paycheck all year. If your employer matches up to 3% of you salary each ''pay period'' when you contribute 6% or more, then the additional contributions in the second half of the year are "wasted", in the sense that your employer will match only up to 6% of salary and no more.

For example, suppose two employees, Consistent Claudia and Procrastinator Pete, are are both paid the same $100,000 salary in 12 monthly paychecks. Claudia consistently contributes 6% each pay period, but Pete skips the first six months and doubles his contributions in the second half of the year:

While both employees contributed the same amount over the year, under the rules of this plan, Claudia will gain the maximum match while Pete will get only half.

Some plans may have a "true up" provision in the plan that will help ensure that an employee who contributes irregularly will still get an employer match based on the employee's total annual contribution, rather than based on a formula for each pay period in isolation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/ashleaebeling/2012/01/13/the-big-401k-match-mistake/| title=The Big 401(k) Match Mistake| publisher=Forbes| accessdate=September 12, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Maximizing employer match ==

If your employer provides a matching contribution, you will want to maximize that amount. Take into account the following considerations:

* As illustrated above, some employers match your contributions only as you make them from payroll, and do not offer "make up" or "true up" contributions; the Federal [[Thrift Savings Plan]] is an example. This can cause you to lose out on some matching funds if:
** You contribute the IRS maximum before the end of the year.
** You suspend contributions for any period of time.
* If your employer does offer true up contributions, then any shortfall in matching funds because of the scenarios above, will be added to your matching funds at the end of the year to "true up" your employer's match. If your employer does offer to true up contributions, then many of the details in this section do not concern you as your employer will make sure you gain the maximum match.

The following considerations are for those who want to maximize their contribution to the IRS maximum, and earn the maximum match available:
* Ideally, if you plan to contribute the IRS maximum, you should contribute a fixed amount per pay period as opposed to a percentage. For example, supposing you are paid two times per month and the IRS maximum is $19,500, then you should elect to contribute $812.50 per pay period ($19,500 / 24).
* Many plans do not allow participants to specify a fixed contribution per pay period, but only offer a percentage contribution based on salary. In this case, calculate what percentage it would take to maximize over the course of the year. For example, if you earn $100,000 per year, and are paid twice per month, and the IRS maximum is $19,500, then, you would choose 19.5%.
* If you have a variable salary, or if you get a raise or salary reduction, then you'll need to regularly recompute your contribution amounts to make sure you wind up contributing the maximum amount while also earning the highest matching amount you can.

== Two or more jobs in one year ==
If you expect you might contribute to two or more plans in the same year, consider the rules for each plan (to the degree possible) to maximize your opportunity to contribute as much as possible, while gaining the maximum possible employer match.

==Employer matches for 401(k) Designated Roth accounts==
Salary deferrals that you direct to a 401(k) designated Roth account qualify for company matching contributions. However, your employer must allocate any designated Roth matching contributions into the 401(k) pre-tax account, just like matching contributions on traditional, pre-tax elective contributions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/retirement-plans-faqs-on-designated-roth-accounts#10| title=Retirement plans FAQs on designated Roth accounts| publisher=IRS| accessdate=September 12, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Normally, the decision of whether to contribute [[Traditional versus Roth|traditional or Roth]] depends mostly on comparing your marginal tax rate now and at withdrawal. However, if you are not able to contribute enough to get the maximum match, then traditional contributions gain an advantage, because you can get a larger match for the same out-of-pocket cost. For the calculations to correctly make that decision, see: [[Traditional versus Roth#Employer match|Traditional versus Roth]].

==Employer matches for SIMPLE IRA plans==
An employer offering a [[SIMPLE IRA]] plan for employees must offer one of two matching contributions:
* '''2% non-elective contribution''' - 2% of each eligible employee's compensation regardless of whether or how much the employee deferred, or
* '''3% matching contribution''' - match employee's elective deferrals on a dollar-for-dollar basis up to 3% of the employee's compensation. An employer is permitted to reduce the 3% limit to a lower percentage, but in any event, not lower than 1%, and may not lower the 3% limit for more than two calendar years out of the five-year period ending with the calendar year the reduction is effective.&lt;ref name="SIMPLE IRA"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/plan-sponsor/simple-ira-plan| title=SIMPLE IRA plan| publisher=IRS| accessdate=September 12, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Employers are required to make the 3% match on yor entire calendar-year compensation, regardless of when you start or stop contributing during the year. The maximum matching contribution is always 3% of your compensation for the entire calendar year. Matching contributions may be made on a per-pay-period basis, or by the due date of the employer’s tax return (including extensions).

However, notice that the employer is only required to match the amount you actually contribute during the year up to a maximum of 3% of your calendar-year compensation. You should select a minimum salary deferral of 3% of compensation to assure a full match.

For example, if you earn $50,000 a year and elect to make 1% salary deferrals for the year, your employer is only required to make a $500 match for the $500 deferral.&lt;ref name="SIMPLE IRA" /&gt;

      <text bytes="5800" sha1="308kdlg8zwljsgy0hqbjpcsurkvskht" xml:space="preserve">'''403b plans for K-12 public school districts''' are for the most part uniquely different from [[403(b)|403b plans]] usually found in higher education and other non-profit organizations. Typically the district maintains a list of 403b providers from which the employee must choose. Neither the companies on the list nor their 403b offerings are vetted by the district in any meaningful way. Life insurance companies selling [[Variable annuity|annuity-based]] 403b plans usually dominate the list, with fees totaling 2% to 3% per year. These annuity based plans usually have a surrender fee of 5 to 10% that can last from 5 to 10 years. Paying the surrender fees is usually cheaper than waiting out the surrender period because of the high annual fees. Financial firms selling expensive [[mutual fund]] based 403b products with [[Expense ratio|fees]] of at least 1% per year are also common. Companies that offer both high cost annuity based and lower cost mutual fund based 403b plans focus on selling the annuity plans with little or no mention of the lower cost mutual fund based plans. These companies are allowed to enter and sell their high cost plans at the schools. Less common on the vendor lists are low-cost, internet based providers, such as [[The Vanguard Group|Vanguard]] and [[Fidelity]] with fees of 0.05% to 0.20% per year. 

==Information sources== 

An excellent source of information on 403b plans, especially those of K-12 school districts, is Dan Otter’s [https://www.403bwise.org/ 403bwise.org website]. There is a growing movement to reform the K-12 403b. The NY Times recently published a series of 5 articles called “Public Sacrifices” describing the K-12 403b problems with suggestions for change.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/23/your-money/403-b-retirement-plans-fees-teachers.html?smid=tw-share&amp;_r=1 403-b Retirement Plans Fees], New York Times, 10/23/2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another excellent source of information on K-12 403b plans are the podcasts by Dan Otter and Scott Dauenhauer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://teachandretirerich.com/podcasts/ Podcasts]&lt;/ref&gt;   

California has a unique law that requires 403b providers to list their offerings with all fees disclosed on the [https://www.403bcompare.com/ 403bcompare.com website] which is maintained by the California State Teachers Retirement System (CalSTRS). This website is an excellent source of information about a plan’s fees in other states as well, because usually the same generic plans are offered nationally. The low-cost DIY Lincoln Investment Group offerings below is not described on 403bcompare and so is not available in California. 

Be aware that many school districts have hired a Third Party Administrator (TPA) to help administer their 403b/457 plans. When this is the case, the provider list is found on the TPA’s website. The TPA may have established rules for adding a new provider to the list. 

If neither Vanguard nor Fidelity are on the provider list, which is the usual case, there are other possible options for a low-cost plan.
:* '''Aspire''' offers a “Self Directed” 403b plan. Aspire is an “aggregator” which offers a large number of funds from various providers, including Vanguard Admiral index funds. They add 0.15% to each fund’s ER and have a $40/yr fee. TPAs will frequently add Aspire to the provider list.)&lt;ref&gt; [https://www.aspireonline.com/resources/faqs Aspire online]&lt;/ref&gt;

:*'''Security Benefit''' offers “NEA Direct Invest” for DIY investors, with 8 very low-cost Vanguard Admiral index funds. There’s no fee added to the funds’ fee but there’s a $35/yr. fee.&lt;ref&gt; [https://www.securitybenefit.com/individuals/products/mutual-fund-custodial/nea-directinvest.aspx Security Benefit]&lt;/ref&gt;  
:*'''PlanMember Group''' offers “PlanMember Direct” which adds 0.35% to Vanguard Admiral index funds. No annual fee.&lt;ref&gt; [http://online.planmember.com/defaultSDContent.cfm?pageID=294 Plan Member Direct]&lt;/ref&gt; 

:*'''Lincoln Investment Group''' offers “Retirement SOLUTIONS Participant-Directed Platform” as a DIY internet based plan. Vanguard Admiral class funds, no added fund fee, and has a $60/yr fee. It is not publicized and must be obtained through a regional Lincoln office, not through a local rep. Not available in California.&lt;ref&gt; [https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=1&amp;t=175295 Forum topic]&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
:*'''Vanguard''' In 2017, Vanguard divested their small &lt;20M 403b plans to Newport Group. The fee structure is now $60 per year rather than a fee per fund. Admiral class funds are now available, as is the Roth 403b option. There is no longer a limit of 4 mutual funds.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.403bcompare.com/products/164#/investmentoptions Investment options]&lt;/ref&gt;

:*'''Fidelity''' offers Premium class funds and charges $24/yr.&lt;ref&gt; [https://www.403bcompare.com/Employee/Vendor/VendorProductList.aspx?vid=1938 403bcompare.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==457 plans==
State-wide [[457|457 plans]] are offered to K-12 employees in many states and are usually excellent and low-cost. For an incomplete list, see: [http://board.403bwise.com/index.php?showtopic=6130 457B State Plans]. This list also includes a few low-cost state-wide 403b plans and the rare 401k plan where available to K-12 employees. 457 plans can be used in addition to a 403b plan, or instead of a high-cost 403b. However high-cost 457 plans are also offered by insurance and financial companies.

These changes were implemented on September 15, 2019. The TSP planned to roll out these changes in September, 2019.&lt;ref name="tsp.date"&gt;{{Cite web

{{blockquote|
The law eliminates the statutory prohibition on multiple post-separation withdrawals and multiple age-based withdrawals while a participant is still working. It also removes the restriction that participants cannot take partial post-separation withdrawals if they’ve already taken an age-based in-service withdrawal. Though it has no effect on required minimum distributions mandated by the Internal Revenue Code, the law also allows separated participants who are over age 70½ to remain in the TSP, eliminating the requirement to make a withdrawal election on an entire account balance. Participants will also be able to stop monthly payments, change payment frequency, or elect to purchase an annuity while receiving monthly payments.

The Executive Director of the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board (FRTIB) has the authority to establish parameters regarding this new ability to take multiple withdrawals, and the law gives the FRTIB up to two years to make the regulatory and operational changes necessary to enact these changes.

From an individual investor's perspective [[403(b)]] plans can be great, acceptable, or very poor. Poor plans are characterized by very high costs and lack of fund choices. If your plan does not have reasonable fees and lacks even a few low-cost index choices, then you may want to approach your management with some suggestions for improving the plan. 

{{Notice|A 403(b) plan, also known as a tax-sheltered annuity (TSA) plan, is a retirement plan for certain employees of public schools, employees of certain tax-exempt organizations, and certain ministers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.irs.gov/publications/p571#en_US_201901_publink1000239614 |title=Publication 571, Tax-Sheltered Annuity Plans (403(b) Plans) |work=What Is a 403(b) Plan?|author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=January 2019 |website= |publisher=Internal Revenue Service|access-date= July 19, 2019|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This article is primarily intended for teachers.}}

==Do your homework==
1. Fully understand the vendors/plans currently approved by your district.&lt;ref name="LaFave"&gt;Unless otherwise stated, content in this section is based on this {{Forum post|title=Re: Teacher 403B Plans|p=4640090|date=Jul 13, 2019|author=EdLaFave}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

2. Fully understand the vendors/plans you want your district to offer.

Employees may think that annuities are the only option in 403(b) plans. This is not the case, as there are actually three types of investments permitted: annuity contracts, custodial accounts for [[Investment management company|regulated investment company]] stock (mutual) funds, and retirement income accounts for churches.&lt;ref name="IRS"&gt;[https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-tege/eotopici95.pdf I. Section 403(b) Tax-Sheltered Annuity Arrangements], Ron Hallsten and Bob Architect, IRS, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

Make sure to request at least one mutual fund custodial company (not just annuity products from insurance companies) to the list of approved vendors. These are called 403(b)(7) custodial accounts and will allow you to invest in mutual funds.&lt;ref name="MNGopher"&gt;{{Forum post|title=Re: Wiki - How to campaign for a better 403(b) plan|p=4645875|author=MNGopher|date=Jul 16, 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Funds contributed to a 403(b) plan may be invested in annuity contracts, custodial accounts for regulated investment company stock (mutual) funds, retirement income accounts for churches, or a combination of these funding vehicles. Because custodial accounts and retirement income accounts are treated as annuity contracts under IRC 403(b)(7) and (b)(9)(A)(i) for purposes of the Code, the term "annuity contract" incorporates all three types of arrangements.&lt;br&gt;
Reference: [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-tege/eotopici95.pdf I. Section 403(b) Tax-Sheltered Annuity Arrangements], Ron Hallsten and Bob Architect, IRS, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Custodial Accounts: Because a custodial account under IRC 403(b)(7) is treated as an annuity contract, it generally must satisfy the various requirements of IRC 403(b). In addition, the assets of a custodial account must be held by a bank or other person who is approved by the Commissioner of the Service pursuant to IRC 401(f) (a "nonbank trustee"). The assets must be invested exclusively in regulated investment company stock (e.g. mutual funds). Consequently, a 403(b)(7) custodial account may not provide life insurance, although it may permit loans to participants. Both salary and nonsalary reduction contributions to a custodial account are subject to certain early distribution restrictions. Excess contributions to a custodial account are subject to a six percent cumulative excise tax under IRC4973.&lt;br&gt;
Reference: [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-tege/eotopici95.pdf I. Section 403(b) Tax-Sheltered Annuity Arrangements], Ron Hallsten and Bob Architect, IRS, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

When working with a district/union, try to add at least one vendor that also offers a brokerage window option (SDBA - Self-Directed Brokerage Account) within the 403(b)b plan. This gives the employees the option of investing in funds, [[Exchange-traded fund|ETFs]], CDs, Bonds, Stocks, etc. through an outside brokerage company. The [https://www.schwab.com/public/schwab/investing/accounts_products/accounts/pcra Schwab PCRA] (Personal Choice Retirement Account) is commonly offered. Employees now have the option to invest beyond the offerings of the 403(b) plan itself.&lt;ref name="CyclingDuo"&gt;{{Forum post|p=4650162|title=Re: Wiki - How to campaign for a better 403(b) plan |author=CyclingDuo |date=July 19, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Example:''' Choices from the main four 403(b) / [[457(b)]] providers - AIG (formerly VALIC); Mass Mutual; Horace Mann; Voya - gives three of those plans that also offer either the Schwab PCRA (AIG) or the TD Ameritrade (Horace Mann and Voya) SDBA brokerage option. Additional fees apply for the SDBAs, but having the option available is worth campaigning for - especially for teachers who have worked many years and have built up a large base of accumulation. Here is an example for Iowa: [https://das.iowa.gov/sites/default/files/hr/ric/403b/documents/AAG_ERE.pdf Iowa Retirement Investors’ Club (RIC)]&lt;ref name="CyclingDuo" /&gt;

3. Based on the previous research, you need to be able to concisely and clearly articulate the scale of the problem, why some vendors are exploitative, and why others should replace them. Expect a 90% probability that everybody you speak to will be reasonably ignorant (don't place a bad connotation on that word) and at least partially financially illiterate (again, don't place a bad connotation on that word)...do not condescend to them, be helpful to them.

4. Reach out to the desired vendors and get in touch with somebody that specifically works on 403b/457b enrollment. Learn how enrollment works from their end and get their direct contact information.

5. Learn about your district's bureaucracy as it relates to 403b/457b plans.

'''Example''': Orange County (FL) has a "Retirement Services" department and above that is somebody with the title of "Senior Director of Risk Management." These are the folks most directly involved in the retirement plans. The district relies on a Third Party Administrator (TPA) to manage the nuts and bolts of running these plans, but for a variety of reasons they unfortunately also rely on them for input/advice. The TPA acts decisively against the best interest of employees, but they MUST obey commands issued from the district. Every five years the district convenes a "fringe committee" (the Union has a seat at the table in addition to district employees) and they're responsible for deciding which vendors will be added to or removed from the approved list. In order to be considered, vendors must respond to a Request for Proposal (RFP) that the district posts on a public website. Above all of that is the school board and superintendent, they can absolutely exert influence on this process. All of that is to say, you should understand how your district does business and you should identify the key decision makers.

==Work your way up the chain==
1. Start at the bottom of the chain of command for both the district and the union.&lt;ref name="LaFave" /&gt;

2. You will have to educate these people and you'll have to do it both well and in way that is socially acceptable (you can't be rude, demanding, etc.).

3. Be prepared to do as much of their job for them as is possible because they may not be particularly interested in doing this. Perhaps they don't really care about this problem, perhaps they don't want something added to their plate, perhaps they are lazy, perhaps they don't want to rock the boat, whatever.

4. Your job is to clearly lay out the problem, lay out the solution, and offer to do as much work as possible yourself. Since you presumably understand the district's process, you understand the process of the vendors you'd like to see added, and you have contacts...you can probably push these folks right to the finish line and all they have to do is step over it.

5. Be prepared to listen to their concerns and their perspective because you may be able to use that information to remove whatever barriers are in their way (real or imagined)...plus people are more likely to help you if they think you care about their circumstances. It can be a give and take.

6. If you're not getting results (and maybe even if you are), then work your way up the chain of command.

7. If you still aren't getting results then you'll need to network with teachers and put pressure on the bureaucracy until they cave. Assume that people love to take the path of least resistance, and it might be your job to turn the path of inaction into a lot of work for them (constant phone calls, constant speeches at the school board meetings, etc).

Of course after all of this, you can still fail because you don't have the power to approve/deny vendors. However, the people who do aren't operating with ill-intent and can therefore be moved to do the right thing...even if they do require a lot of prodding (welcome to bureaucracy).

It is possible to fund a [[Roth| Roth account]] far above normal contribution limits&lt;ref name=roth-ira-limit&gt;{{cite web|publisher= IRS |title=Retirement Topics - IRA Contribution Limits: Roth IRA contribution limit|date= December 15, 2020| url=https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/plan-participant-employee/retirement-topics-ira-contribution-limits}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=roth-401k-limit&gt;{{cite web |publisher= IRS| title= Retirement Topics - Designated Roth Account: Contributing to a designated Roth account| date= May 13, 2021| url= https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/plan-participant-employee/retirement-topics-designated-roth-account#contributing}}&lt;/ref&gt; through a strategy known informally as the '''mega-backdoor Roth'''. This process is available only through select [[401(k)|employer plans]], and the rules for these plans may vary considerably from one company to another. As shown in the figure below, the strategy involves two steps:

#Contributing to an [[After-tax 401(k)|after-tax 401(k) account]], and
#Rolling the funds over to either a [[Roth IRA]], or to a [[401(k)#Roth_401(k)| Roth sub-account]] within the plan.

The net effect of the above is equivalent to contributing to a Roth account, but there are no income limits for either of the two steps,{{#tag:ref|See  [[Highly compensated employee|Highly Compensated Employee (HCE)]] for a potential exception: if the company fails IRS nondiscrimination tests, it may decide to partially refund or constrain HCE contributions.&lt;ref name=EF2017 /&gt;|group=note}} unlike for Roth IRA contributions. The biggest advantage of this strategy stems from the fact that the [[After-tax 401(k)|after-tax 401(k) account]] has different rules from [[401(k)|traditional]] and [[401(k)#Roth_401(k)|Roth 401(k)]] accounts: it is subject to much higher contribution [[After-tax 401(k)#After-tax 401(k) limits|limits]] (up to $72,000 in 2026, per IRC 415(c){{#tag:ref| Note that the IRC Section 415(c) limit of $72,000 applies to the total of traditional, Roth and after-tax contributions to the 401(k), including the employer match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=

Note that "mega-backdoor Roth" is an informal term; neither the IRS nor your company will officially recognize it, and tax preparers may not be familiar with it either. The term is just a colloquial phrase that investors use. So if you come across someone who has never heard of it, just use the terms "after-tax 401(k) contribution" (step 1), and "Roth conversion" (step 2) instead, because that's what is really happening. After-tax 401(k) contributions are different from, and should not be confused with, Roth 401(k) contributions.

Also note that there is a process called [[backdoor Roth]] that is completely different from the mega-backdoor Roth. They are independent of each other, and can [[#The backdoor and mega-backdoor Roths|both be performed]] in the same year.

The discussion below refers to generic IRS rules; consult your own company's documentation for specifics.

== Advantages ==
* For those whose plans allow it, this strategy allows for '''large contributions''' to Roth accounts (theoretically up to $70,000, but more typically [[After-tax 401(k)#After-tax 401(k) limits|$46,500 minus any employer match]]), which are in addition to direct contribution limits to a [[Roth IRA]], and to a [[401(k)]] through elective salary deferrals. Tax-free growth on this money adds up to a large tax savings over an investor's lifetime.
* If funds are rolled into a Roth IRA through in-service distributions,&lt;ref group = "note"&gt;Some 401(k)s allow for in-service distributions, allowing employees to roll over funds during employment without a triggering event. A triggering event is an event that a participant in a qualified plan must experience in order to be eligible to receive a distribution from a qualified plan. For most 401(k) plans, the triggering events are:
*Attaining retirement age
*Termination of employment (you are no longer employed by the company that offers the 401(k) plan in question)
*Death - in this case, your beneficiaries are allowed to distribute your assets
*Disability - the document that governs the 401(k) plan generally provides a definition of "disability"
*Your employer terminates the 401(k) plan and does not replace it with another qualified plan 
See: [http://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/triggeringevent.asp Triggering Event], [http://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/169.asp Can I roll my 401(k) and/or IRA funds into a more liquid investment fund without penalty?], on Investopedia&lt;/ref&gt; or into a Roth 401k using an [https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/retirement-plans-faqs-on-designated-roth-accounts#Inplan in-plan Roth rollover], soon after contribution, gains (and tax on them) will be minimal.  Further growth in either Roth account is tax-free (subject to the usual Roth restrictions).
* Roth 401(k) conversions offer [[Asset protection|protection]] from creditors under ERISA.
* Roth IRA conversions have the advantage of flexible withdrawals: see the [[#Withdrawals| Withdrawals]] section below for details.

== Potential disadvantages ==
* Additional paperwork: You may receive two 1099-R's every year, one for the rollover and one for the gains. As many accountants are not aware of the documentation requirements, this increases the chance for error.
* If you die with funds waiting for rollover, the inheritor is left with a non-deductible IRA with more complicated paperwork.
* If you incur losses before rollover, "basis" could be lost if you do not leave a few pennies in the account. Check with your plan to see how it handles this situation.
* If the company fails nondiscrimination tests, restrictions on contributions (e.g. as a percent-of-pay limit) or a return of contributions may result.&lt;ref name=EF2017&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.employeefiduciary.com/blog/whats-old-is-new-again-mega-back-door-roth-ira-contributions-spark-new-interest-in-old-school-after-tax-contributions|title=What’s Old Is New Again: “Mega Back Door” Roth IRA Contributions Spark New Interest in Old School After-Tax Contributions|publisher=Employee Fiduciary|accessdate=15 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; See [[Highly compensated employee]].
* Saving such a large amount of money inside a retirement account may be too big a strain on some investors's budgets. While a Roth account provides great tax savings, [[Asset protection|asset protection]], and [[Estate planning|estate planning]] benefits, investors should consider this strategy as part of their overall financial plan, fitting any contributions within their [[Household_budgeting|budget]], and considering both immediate and [[Retirement_spending|future financial goals]]. Investors not able to comfortably make a full mega-backdoor Roth contribution should consider a partial contribution instead, and non-mega-backdoor Roth contributions should be made [[Prioritizing_investments|first]]. 

==Determining if your plan supports the mega-backdoor Roth==
The mega-backdoor Roth strategy is not supported by all 401(k) plans. The plan must offer both of the following features: 
# '''After-tax contributions''' to the 401(k), and 
# Roth conversions of after-tax contributions, either as an '''in-plan conversion''' or as an '''in-service distribution''', as described below.

Note that "mega-backdoor Roth" is an unofficial term and unlikely to be recognized by your company; the bolded phrases above are what you should check for. Your 401(k) plan documentation, often referred to as a Summary Plan Description, contains the details for after-tax withdrawals or conversions and whether or not they're allowed. Specifically, they need to be allowed without a "triggering event". Triggering events include job loss, retirement, or death, and are typical for many types of contracts.&lt;ref name="jakehefty17"&gt;{{Forum post|p=6054927| title = Re: Wiki - "Mega backdoor Roth" vs. After-tax 401(k) | author = jakehefty17 | date = June 08, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Notice|It's imperative that the rules and restrictions are thoroughly understood prior to attempting a mega-backdoor Roth.}}

The rules regarding Roth conversions of after-tax 401(k) contributions vary greatly between employer plans. Some allow for '''in-plan conversions''' into a [[401(k)#Roth 401(k)|Roth 401(k) account]], while other plans allow a rollover into a Roth IRA account, which is referred to as an '''in-service distribution'''. If both options are offered, which one may be preferred is a personal choice, but below is some rationale for each approach.

* Can minimize taxable [[#Earnings on after-tax contributions|earnings]] if an automatic conversion plan is offered.

Be sure to check for rules or restrictions that may surround withdrawals. Some potential examples include&lt;ref name="jakehefty17" /&gt; suspension of after-tax contributions, or matching contributions, for a specified timeframe after receiving the distribution; or requiring you contact Human Resources to resume making after-tax contributions to your plan.

==Earnings on after-tax contributions==
Earnings associated with after-tax contributions (i.e., earnings that occur in between step 1 and step 2) are pretax amounts.{{#tag:ref|Note that pre-1987 after-tax contributions have a different tax treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Publication 3749 (Rev. 3-2010): Rollovers of Pre-1987 After-Tax Contributions|publisher=IRS|url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p3749.pdf|date=March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; See the [[After-tax 401(k)#Taxation|After-tax 401(k)]] page for details.|group=note}} Distribution of these earnings (in step 2) is therefore taxable as ordinary income. Therefore, to avoid taxes, it makes sense to perform the two steps in quick sequence. To facilitate this, some plans may also provide for automatic in-plan Roth conversions, which can be scheduled to occur immediately after the after-tax 401(k) contribution. Another option is to invest the after-tax contributions in a [[Stable value fund|stable value fund]] or a [[Money_markets#The_money_market_fund|money market fund]], to minimize taxable earnings in the short period before performing step 2.

Alternatively, any earnings may be rolled over into a traditional IRA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/rollovers-of-after-tax-contributions-in-retirement-plans |title=Rollovers of After-Tax Contributions in Retirement Plans |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=27 Aug 2017 |website= Internal Revenue Service|publisher=Internal Revenue Service |access-date= December 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Note, however, that this may cause [[Backdoor_Roth#Cautions|pro-rata issues]] if the [[backdoor Roth]] is also being performed in the same year. In this case it should be possible to roll the earnings ''back'' into the 401(k) pre-tax sub account; this rollover would need to complete before December 31st. But, considering that the earnings may be small, it might make more sense to do a direct rollover of the entire amount to your Roth IRA and pay taxes on the earnings.&lt;ref name="alan.s" /&gt;

If desired, the plan provider should provide the option to distribute the ''contributions'' and ''earnings'' separately (one check for ''earnings'', one check for ''contributions''). Each distribution can then be rolled over into a separate, appropriate account.

Some plan providers may not offer this choice (one check for both ''earnings'' and ''contributions''). If this is the case, request a single check payable to yourself. The plan must withhold 20% of the earnings (the pre tax portion of the check), so your net check is a little less than the distribution.&lt;ref name="alan.s"&gt;{{Forum post|p=3685885|title=Re: Backdoor Roth Question|author = Alan S.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Then, do a 60 day rollover of the gross pretax amount (the earnings) to your traditional IRA. Do this first.&lt;ref name="alan.s" /&gt;
Once complete, then roll the after tax amount (making up the withheld amount from your other funds) into your Roth IRA.&lt;ref name="alan.s" /&gt;
There is no tax on the distribution. Report it as a rollover on Form 1040 lines 5a and 5b just like you would a direct rollover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/publications/p590a#en_US_2020_publink1000230648|publisher=IRS|title=Publication 590-A (2020), Contributions to Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs): Rollover From Employer's Plan Into an IRA|date=March 5, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; Remember to claim credit for the withholding that will show on the 1099-R.&lt;ref name="alan.s" /&gt;

==Withdrawals==

The rules for withdrawals depend on how the mega-backdoor Roth strategy was executed: via a Roth IRA, or a Roth 401(k) conversion. The following discussion pertains only to Roth IRA conversions; for Roth 401(k) withdrawal rules, consult your company's documentation. 

[[Roth IRA|Roth IRAs]] offer flexibility in [[Roth IRA#Distributions|withdrawals]]: direct contributions (but not earnings) can be withdrawn at any time without penalty. This is also true for amounts converted using the mega-backdoor Roth strategy, but there may be a penalty on [[#Earnings on after-tax contributions|any earnings]] that occurred ''before'' conversion.&lt;ref name= tfb-mbd-withdrawals /&gt;&lt;ref name= fairmark-roth-distribution /&gt; If the earnings were small, the penalty is also small; after 5 tax years, the penalty becomes zero. This is explained below using an example.

===Example===

Consider a 30-year-old investor who has made $7,500 in direct contributions to her Roth IRA. She now decides to employ the mega-backdoor Roth strategy: she contributes $10,000 to her after-tax 401(k) account (step 1), and then rolls it over to her Roth IRA (step 2). Suppose there were $100 in earnings accrued in between steps 1 and 2. The net balance in the Roth IRA is now $17,100.

If the investor now wishes to withdraw money from her Roth IRA, she must do so in this order:

* First, the $7,500 in direct contributions.
* Next, the $100 in pre-conversion earnings (with an associated 10% penalty).
* Then the remaining $10,000. 

If she were to withdraw the entire balance, she would pay a $10 penalty to withdraw $17,600. If there had been no earnings pre-conversion, there would be no penalty (10% of $0 = $0).&lt;ref name= tfb-mbd-withdrawals /&gt; 

The penalty on pre-conversion earnings can be avoided if the withdrawal takes place after 5 tax years, i.e., after January 1 of the [https://www.kitces.com/blog/understanding-the-two-5-year-rules-for-roth-ira-contributions-and-conversions/#the-second-5-year-rule-for-roth-conversions 5th year] following the conversion. This is known as the 5-year rule for Roth conversions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Understanding The Two 5-Year Rules For Roth IRA Contributions And Conversions|url=https://www.kitces.com/blog/understanding-the-two-5-year-rules-for-roth-ira-contributions-and-conversions/#the-second-5-year-rule-for-roth-conversions|publisher=Kitces|date=January 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===A more complex example===

The investor repeats the mega-backdoor Roth process next year: this time, she contributes $20,000, and accrues $200 in between steps 1 and 2. Also suppose the money that was already inside the Roth IRA grew by $1000. If she now wants to draw money from the account, it must be in this order:

* First, the $7,500 in direct contributions.
* Then the first conversion, in this order:
** The $100 in pre-conversion earnings (with an associated 10% penalty).
** The remaining $10,000. 
* Next, the second conversion: 
** The $200 in pre-conversion earnings (with an associated 10% penalty).
** The remaining $20,000. 
* Finally, the $1000 in earnings that occurred ''inside'' the Roth IRA (with an associated 10% penalty, as well as taxes).

These examples show the importance of keeping long-term records of how money gets into the Roth IRA. Withdrawals must happen in the order described above, with conversions ordered first-in, first-out. And each conversion has its own 5-year clock, after which the penalty on the (small) pre-conversion earnings becomes zero.

For further details such as distributions after age 59.5, exceptions to penalties, etc., see the [[Roth IRA#Distributions|Roth IRA]] article.

==The backdoor and mega-backdoor Roths==

The mega-backdoor Roth should not be confused with the [[backdoor Roth]], a similarly titled but entirely different technique, which allows you to fund a Roth IRA above income-based contribution limits. As the name implies, the mega-backdoor Roth (usually) allows a larger contribution than the backdoor Roth.

However, this does not mean you should do only one or the other. As the following table shows, they are independent strategies with separate limits, which can both be executed in the same year. They both involve two steps: contribution and conversion, but use a completely different set of accounts.

|}
Be sure to thoroughly read the corresponding articles and IRS documentation before attempting either, as mistakes may be time-consuming and costly to rectify.

Note that there is one special situation in which the two processes can interfere, described in the [[#Earnings on after-tax contributions|previous section]], that occurs when rolling over after-tax earnings to an IRA. This can be resolved using any of the methods described in the [[Backdoor Roth#Cautions|backdoor Roth]] article, such as rolling the IRA earnings back over to a 401(k).

==Mega-backdoor Roth with a Solo 401k==

While the previous sections apply generally to employer plans, there are special considerations for employees who are their own employer (i.e., are paid directly by customers or on a [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1099msc.pdf Form 1099], instead of on a [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fw2.pdf W-2]). Self-employed individuals have access to an Individual or [[Solo 401k]], which they both administer and contribute to. This has a number of implications for the mega-backdoor Roth process.

Without a mega-backdoor Roth, contribution limits to a Solo 401(k) are:
*Up to the Section 402(g) elective deferral limit ($23,500 in 2025) from wages paid through payroll, and can be traditional or Roth as the plan allows
*Up to 25% of wages paid through payroll as employer contributions, and these can only be traditional
*Up to the Section 415(c) limit ($72,000 in 2026) for total of all employee and employer contributions 

Therefore, a self-employed investor can contribute the maximum to their Solo 401(k) with wages of at least $190,000 (=[$72,000 - $24,500] / 25%) if making an elective deferral, or $288,000 (=$72,000 / 25%) if not (e.g., making the elective deferral at another employer to get a match). 

When adding a mega-backdoor Roth strategy, the ''total'' of elective deferrals and [[After-tax 401(k)|after-tax]] contributions cannot be greater than wages, and the total of all elective deferrals, after-tax contributions, and employer contributions cannot be greater than the Section 415(c) limit. While the mega-backdoor Roth does not raise the general amount that can be contributed to a Solo 401k, it does have two consequences that could be beneficial to certain investors. 

First, it allows maximum contribution with much lower wages, and by extension much less business income. If contributing entirely with elective deferral and after-tax contributions, wages of just $70,000 are needed, with the caveat that after-tax contributions cannot be tax-deferred like employer contributions. This can be an advantage for investors whose business does not earn enough to pay the wages needed to contribute the maximum otherwise, and/or investors who prefer to pay lower wages to themselves due to the [[Payroll tax|payroll tax]] savings. 

Second, it allows a potentially larger [[Traditional_versus_Roth#Business_tax_considerations|Section 199A deduction]], both through lower wages, and also because employer contributions are deductible against Qualified Business Income (QBI) while employee after-tax contributions are not. This advantage only applies to self-employed investors who are able to take advantage of a Section 199A deduction; owners of a Specified Service Trade or Business (SSTB) whose income is above the phase-out limit will get no benefit through this mechanism, although lower wages will still provide a payroll tax savings. Investors who are inside the SSTB phase-out range will likely see very high marginal tax rates, and should likely maximize deductible employer contributions before pursuing any mega-backdoor Roth strategy, to lower taxable income.

For business owners who have a high enough income and wages to contribute the maximum without the mega-backdoor Roth, and who prefer pre-tax contributions to Roth even considering any potential loss of QBI deduction, the mega-backdoor Roth feature will probably provide no benefit. 

===Salary===

{{Warning|Failure to pay yourself a "reasonable" salary per IRS requirements may result in reclassification of compensation, additional taxes, and penalties. Consult a qualified tax professional to determine what constitutes reasonable compensation for your particular business and responsibilities.}}

The IRS requires business owners to pay themselves a “reasonable”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/paying-yourself| title=Paying Yourself| publisher=IRS| accessdate=June 14, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; salary with wages, placing an additional constraint on Solo 401k contributions. Readers unsure of what constitutes “reasonable” compensation for their particular situation should consult a tax professional. The IRS is aware of the tax savings that can be realized through lower salaries, particularly after the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and the Section 199A deduction. IRS guidance&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/s-corporation-compensation-and-medical-insurance-issues| title=S Corporation Compensation and Medical Insurance Issues| publisher=IRS| accessdate=June 14, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; states that business revenue generated by a shareholder's personal services should be classified as wages. In addition to the risks of taxes and penalties, lowering your salary can have other negative impacts, such as reducing future Social Security benefits, and possible benefits through your state's unemployment program.

===Mega-backdoor Roth capable Solo 401k plans===

{{Warning|In almost all cases, the mega-backdoor Roth strategy with a Solo 401(k) should be administered by a qualified Third Party Administrator (TPA) to ensure legal and compliance requirements are met. Readers are strongly discouraged from administering their own Mega-backdoor Roth contributions inside a Solo 401(k), as this runs the risk of penalties and fines from the IRS, including forced dissolution of the plan.}}

None of the free Solo 401k plans from the major brokerages (E*Trade, Fidelity, Vanguard, etc.) allow after-tax contributions, and by extension the mega-backdoor Roth. Performing a mega-backdoor Roth in a Solo 401(k) requires the administration by a qualified Third Party Administrator (TPA), who can ensure all legal and paperwork requirements are met. The administrator's fees should be weighed against any potential tax savings of a mega-backdoor Roth.

===Advantages with a Solo 401k plan===

Potential advantages include:
*Investors can contribute the maximum to a Solo 401k with a much lower salary and business income
*Investors can get a larger Section 199A deduction 
*Investors who already desire Roth contributions may prefer mega-backdoor Roth contributions to making employer contributions and then trying to roll those over into a Roth account

===Disadvantages with a Solo 401k plan===

Potential disadvantages include:
*Mega-backdoor Roth-capable Solo 401k plans are more complex and have setup and ongoing fees
*Mega-backdoor Roth contributions can only be Roth, so investors who have a strong desire for traditional contributions (e.g., those in the SSTB phase-out range) may see adverse tax impacts
*There is additional complexity to performing this multi-step maneuver, and more opportunities for mistakes

===Example===

A self-employed investor earns $260,000 per year in their non-SSTB S-corporation, net business expenses but before wages and payroll tax. Without a mega-backdoor Roth strategy, and assuming the investor makes an elective deferral and sets their wages at $190,000 to maximize Solo 401k contributions, their Qualified Business Income (QBI) and Section 199A deduction would be calculated as follows: 

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Line Item !! Excel Calculation !! Value

| Business income net expenses || 260000 || $260,000

|-

|}

If this investor instead decided to adopt a mega-backdoor Roth strategy using a Solo 401(k) with a $500 fee, set their salary to $100,000 (the minimum their tax advisor recommends while still being reasonable), no employer contributions and the net as after-tax contributions, QBI would be calculated as follows:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Line Item !! Excel Calculation !! Value
|-
| Business income net expenses || 260000 || $260,000
|-
| Wages || 100000 || $100,000
|-
| Mega-backdoor Roth Solo 401k fee || 500 || $500
|-
| Employer Social Security tax || =MIN(184500,''wages'')*6.2% || $6,200
|-
| Employer Medicare tax || =''wages''*1.45% || $1,450
|-
| '''Qualified Business Income (QBI)''' || Income minus all expenses || '''$151,850'''
|-
| '''Section 199A deduction''' || =''QBI''*20% || '''$30,370'''
|}

Taxable income would then be calculated as follows:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Line Item !! Excel Calculation !! Value
|-
| Wages net elective deferral (W-2) || =100000-24500 || $75,500
|-
| Qualified Business Income (K-1) || ''calculated above'' || $151,850
|-
| Standard deduction || -30000 || -$32,200
|-
| Section 199A deduction || ''calculated above'' || -$30,370
|-
| '''Taxable income''' || ''sum of above values'' || '''$164,780'''
|}

Taxable income is predictably higher due to the Roth contributions, but the complete tax picture is more complex.  Since this level of taxable income would be in the 22% tax bracket, net impacts to each type of tax are as follows:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Tax Type !! Excel Calculation !! Value
|-
| Income tax || =(164780-141638.80)*22% || +$5091.06
|-
| Medicare tax || =(1450-2755)*2 || -$2610.00
|-
| Social Security tax || =(6200-11439)*2 || -$10478.00
|}

The effective [[Marginal tax rate|marginal tax rates]] for this strategy tell an interesting story. The marginal tax rate for the $46,500 mega-backdoor Roth contribution can be calculated in several ways:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! scope="col" style="width: 210pt;" | Marginal Tax Rate Includes
! scope="col" style="width: 210pt;" | Excel Calculation
! scope="col" style="width: 40pt;" | Value
|-
| Income tax and Solo 401k fee only || =(5091.06+500)/47500 || 11.77%
|-
| Income tax, Solo 401k fee, and Medicare tax || =(5091.06+500-2610)/47500 || 6.28%
|-
| Income tax, Solo 401k fee, and ''all'' payroll tax || =(5091.06+500-2610-10478)/47500 || -15.78%
|-
| Income tax, Solo 401k fee, and ''all'' payroll tax assuming a 40% payback rate on SS tax || =(5361.88+500-(2610+10478)*.60)/47500 || -4.76%
|}

Looking only at income tax and treating the Solo 401k fee as a tax-like cost, this investor can contribute $47,500 to Roth accounts at a marginal tax rate of just 11.77%, despite being in the 22% bracket. Marginal tax rate calculations do not typically include [[payroll tax]], because there is usually no difference; normal retirement contributions are not payroll tax-deductible. However, in this case, there is a change in payroll taxes by adopting the mega-backdoor Roth strategy. Also considering the savings in Medicare tax, which does not provide any direct benefit to the taxpayer, the effective rate drops to around 6%. 

If Social Security tax is included too, the rate drops well below zero, meaning that this investor actually pays ''lower'' total taxes and fees despite contributing to Roth accounts instead of tax-deferred. However, this ignores the potential increased future Social Security benefit that comes from paying more Social Security tax. Assuming a [[Social_Security_as_an_investment#Payback_rate|payback rate]] of 40% on Social Security tax (reasonable for someone in the 15% PIA bracket), the marginal tax rate is very close to zero, meaning this investor is able to contribute to Roth instead of pre-tax for almost no net cost. This tax strategy is likely very beneficial for this investor. The expected benefit of this strategy could be better or worse than outlined here, depending on the investor's future marginal tax rates, Social Security bracket, lifespan, and other factors. See: [[Social Security as an investment]].

Note that the payroll tax savings can be realized without the mega-backdoor Roth strategy simply by lowering the salary to $100,000 with a standard Solo 401(k). However, this would lower maximum contributions to $49,500, $24,500 from elective deferrals and $25,000 from the business, the latter of which must be tax-deferred.

The so-called '''Rule of 55''' allows you to withdraw from a [[401(k)]] or [[403(b)]] without paying the 10% early withdrawal penalty on withdrawals you make after separating from service, if you separate from the sponsoring employer in or after the calendar year you turn 55. The rule does not apply to [[IRA|IRAs]]. This rule can allow you to access retirement money without penalty up to 5½ years earlier (if your birthday is late in the year and you separate early in the year you turn 55) than waiting until age 59½, the normal age where early withdrawal penalties get waived.

There are other ways to [[User:Fyre4ce/Early withdrawal|withdraw early]] from a retirement account without penalty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/plan-participant-employee/retirement-topics-exceptions-to-tax-on-early-distributions| title=Retirement topics - Exceptions to tax on early distributions| publisher=IRS| accessdate=August 25, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision of whether to [[Early retirement|retire early]] can be an impactful one, so make sure you have planned appropriately.

The term "Rule of 55" is not an official government term, although it is used ubiquitously throughout the finance community. The IRS uses the official term "Separation from service" to describe this exception to the early withdrawal penalty. The rules are laid out in Internal Revenue Code sections 72(t)(2)(A)(v) and 72(t)(10).

==Constraints==

*The Rule of 55 (hereafter, "the rule") only applies to [[401(k)]], [[403(b)]], and [[457(b)]] accounts, and the [[Thrift Savings Plan]]. It does not apply to [[IRA|IRAs]], even if you first [[IRA rollovers and transfers|roll money out]] of one of these accounts into an IRA. It also does not apply if you resume working for a new employer and roll the money into the new plan, unless you separate from the new employer before you turn 59½.
*The rule applies only if you separate anytime within the year you turn 55, or after,&lt;ref group="note"&gt;This is in contrast normal early withdrawal penalties, which apply down to the day - that is, you will owe a 10% penalty if you withdraw even one day before you turn 59½. The IRS defines age 59½ as six months after your 59th birthday.&lt;/ref&gt; and only applies to withdrawals taken after your separation date. If you separate before the calendar year you turn 55, you cannot later take advantage of the rule when you turn 55.
*The rule applies only to the plan at an employer you separate from in or after the year you turn 55. The rule does not apply to plans at former employers. However, you may be able to roll money at a former employer into the current employer's plan, making it eligible for the rule. 
*Plans are not required to allow you to make partial withdrawals after you separate, in which case the rule is nearly useless.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;There may be more complex ways to work around this restriction. For example, you could perform an indirect rollover to an IRA, and retain the amount you need until you turn 59½ from the rollover. This strategy would have a more benign tax impact if you are closer to 59½ than 55, and if you have other sources of money to help fund this period.&lt;/ref&gt; You would have to take lump sum withdrawal, which would concentrate a large amount of taxable income in a single year, and forego future tax-protected growth.

==Other details==

*The reason for terminating employment (e.g., quitting, retiring, laid off, fired) is not relevant, but the employment relationship must be completely severed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-wd/00-0245.pdf| title=Sarbanes letter| publisher=IRS| accessdate=September 3, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt; Merely switching to part-time does not count, nor would separating and then rehiring just for the purpose of activating the rule. The rule would apply if you are rehired after some period of time, as long as there was a legitimate change in circumstances, but the plan might not allow you to withdraw in this case, making the rule useless. The rule also applies if you convert to independent contractor status. 
*You can terminate employment more than once. For example, if you leave employer A in the year you turn 55, and start working for employer B when you are 57, you can still take penalty-free withdrawals from the plan at employer A. If you leave employer B before you turn 59½, you can take penalty-free withdrawals from ''both'' plans.
*For some public safety employees, such as police officers, firefighters, EMTs, and air traffic controllers, the rule applies in the calendar year in which they turn '''50''', or with 25 years of service under the plan, whichever comes first.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.schwab.com/learn/story/retiring-early-5-key-points-about-rule-55| title=When Can You Withdraw? 401(k)s and the Rule of 55| publisher=Charles Schwab| author=Hayden Adams| date=April 1, 2025| accessdate=August 25, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*457(b) plans normally do not have any early withdrawal penalties. However, governmental 457(b) plans can accept rollovers from other types of accounts, and any non-457(b) money withdrawn before age 59½ has an early withdrawal penalty unless an exception applies. The rule waives penalties on any non-457 withdrawals.
*Even though the rule waives the 10% early withdrawal penalty, you will still owe income taxes on withdrawals you make from pre-tax (also known as "traditional") accounts. 
*The rule also applies to withdrawals from a designated Roth account (for example, [[401(k)#Roth_401(k)|Roth 401(k)]]). But, while the rule will waive penalties on withdrawals, the earnings that have accrued inside the account are still taxable until the Roth account is ''qualified.'' The account becomes qualified when you have met the 5-year period of participation since your first contribution to this account, ''and'' you are either 59½ or disabled. For non-qualified withdrawals, earnings and basis are pro-rata.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/retirement-plans-faqs-on-designated-roth-accounts| title=Retirement plans FAQs on designated Roth accounts| publisher=IRS| accessdate=August 25, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, a rollover to Roth IRA is suggested where the withdrawal rules do not require the earnings and basis to be pro-rated.

Certain types of tax-advantaged accounts have '''early withdrawal''' penalties if you withdraw money from the account before reaching a certain age and an exception doesn't apply. Most retirement accounts ([[401(k)|401(k)s]], [[403(b)|403(b)s]], [[IRA|IRAs]], and others) have a 10% penalty for withdrawals before age 59½, but there are many exceptions. Many types of annuities have this early withdrawal penalty as well. [[Health savings account|Health Savings Accounts (HSAs)]] have a 20% penalty for non-qualified withdrawals (that is, not for qualified medical expenses) before age 65. This page provides the details of these penalties, and the exceptions to them.

Just because you can take penalty-free withdrawals doesn't necessarily mean you ''should''. Withdrawing early from a retirement account foregoes future tax-deferred or tax-free growth, and will prolong the time it takes to become financially independent. Make sure any withdrawals fit within your overall financial plan. 

[[Taxable account|Taxable accounts]] have no early withdrawal penalties.

==Retirement accounts==

Retirement accounts generally have a '''10%''' early withdrawal penalty if you withdraw money before age 59½.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Age 59½ is defined as 6 months after your 59th birthday. For example, if you turn 59 on March 15th, then you turn 59½ on September 15th. Penalties are determined using the actual day of the withdrawal - that is, if you withdraw on September 14th, you will owe the penalty.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are many exceptions that can allow you to access money in retirement accounts before you turn 59½ without penalty:

*Contributions to a [[Roth IRA]] can always be withdrawn tax- and penalty-free. This also applies to [[401(k)#Roth_401(k)|Roth 401(k)]] contributions that are later rolled into a Roth IRA. Early withdrawals directly from a Roth 401(k) are more complicated and often incur tax on earnings; see [[#Roth_accounts|below]].
*The [[Rule of 55]] allows you to withdraw penalty-free from a 401(k) or 403(b) plan if you separate from that employer in or after the year you turn 55. The rule applies even if you separate early in the year and turn 55 much later the same year. It does not apply to money in any former employer's plans, or in an [[IRA]]. 
*You can set up a [[Roth_conversion#Roth_conversion_ladder|Roth conversion ladder]]. Each conversion has a 5-year clock before the converted amount can be withdrawn penalty-free, so if using this method for an [[early retirement]], you will need an alternate source of funding for the first 4-5 years if you want to avoid early withdrawal penalties.
*You can set up a [[Substantially equal periodic payments|Substantially Equal Periodic Payments (SEPP)]] plan (also known as a Section 72(t) plan) from a [[401(k)]], [[403(b)]], or IRA. This plan allows you to take similarly-sized withdrawals penalty-free for at least five years or until you turn 59½, whichever is longer.
*Although not technically an early withdrawal, a [[401(k)#Early_withdrawals_and_loans|plan loan]] from a 401(k) or 403(b) is another way to access funds penalty-free from these plans. 
*[[457(b)]] plans have no early withdrawal penalties, except when non-457(b) money is rolled into a 457(b) and later withdrawn early.

The following table summarizes exceptions to the early withdrawal penalty from retirement accounts:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/plan-participant-employee/retirement-topics-exceptions-to-tax-on-early-distributions| title=Retirement topics - Exceptions to tax on early distributions| publisher=IRS| accessdate=August 27, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|}

In addition, there are exceptions to the penalty for administrative actions, including permissive withdrawals from a plan with auto-enrollment, corrective distributions, a Qualified Domestic Relations Order (QDRO), dividend pass-through from an Employee Stock Options Plan (ESOP), IRS levy, returned IRA contributions, and rollovers. 

Death is always an exception to early withdrawal penalties for every account. But, note that the [[Required Minimum Distribution|Required Minimum Distribution (RMD)]] rules for inherited accounts can be complex, and the penalties for failing to take RMDs are large. In addition, you may be able to realize significant tax savings by tax-planning. Expert guidance is recommended when inheriting a retirement account. See also: [[Stretch IRA]].

Whether an employer plan allows distributions and whether early withdrawal penalties apply are two different things, the former being governed by the plan and the latter by IRS rules. Employer plans are only required to allow withdrawals when you separate from service, become disabled, die, for [[Required Minimum Distribution|RMDs]], or if/when the plan terminates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.employeefiduciary.com/blog/401k-distribution-rules-frequently-asked-questions| title=401(k) Distribution Rules: Frequently Asked Questions for Employers and Employees| publisher=Employee Fiduciary| author=Eric Droblyen| date=May 6, 2025 |accessdate=September 1, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, many plans do not allow you to withdraw after you turn 59½ if you are still working, even though such withdrawals would be penalty-free. Plans ''may'' offer [[401(k)#In-service_distribution|In-service withdrawals]], [[#Hardship_distributions|hardship distributions]], and/or [[#Plan_loans|plan loans]] as ways to access money inside the plan. Plans are even allowed to [[401(k)#Involuntary_cash_out_distributions|involuntarily cash out]] accounts of former employees if the balance is small enough.

Unlike employer plans, you are allowed to withdraw from an [[IRA]] at any time for any reason, with the tax treatment and any penalties being determined by IRS rules. Whether a withdrawal is advisable for your overall financial plan is a separate question. 

===Hardship distributions===

Employer retirement plans ''may'', but are not required to, allow employees to withdraw money from plans before age 59½ for financial hardships, defined as an immediate and heavy financial need, and you are only allowed to withdraw the amount necessary to satisfy that need.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/plan-participant-employee/retirement-topics-hardship-distributions| title=Retirement topics - Hardship distributions| publisher=IRS| accessdate=August 27, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such withdrawals ''may be'' subject to early withdrawal penalties if one of the exceptions does not apply. 

===Plan loans===

Some employer plans offer a [[401(k)#Early_withdrawals_and_loans|loan feature]], which allows you to borrow money from the plan and repay it within five years, with interest, through payroll deductions. The loan amount is limited to 50% of your balance or $50,000, whichever is less. Unlike contributions, interest payments are not tax-deductible but are later taxable when you withdraw. If you don't pay the loan back for any reason, it will be considered a distribution and you will owe taxes and a 10% penalty on the loan balance. If you separate from your employer, you have until your tax filing deadline (with extensions) for that tax year to completely pay the loan back. While a plan loan can be convenient and relatively low-impact way to temporarily get money out of your plan, they have significant risks and are best reserved for emergencies only. 

===457(b) plans===
{{Main|457(b)}}

There are two types of 457(b) plans: governmental and non-governmental. Despite the similarity in name, they are very different. A governmental 457(b) behaves similarly to a 401(k) or 403(b), whereas a non-governmental 457(b) behaves more like a private deferred compensation plan. Contributions to and earnings within either type of 457(b) never have any early withdrawal penalties, but there are some considerations for early withdrawals for each.

Governmental 457(b) plans are allowed to accept incoming rollovers from non-457(b) accounts. However, the plan must segregate non-457(b) money, and any non-457(b) money you withdraw early is subject to a penalty if an exception doesn't apply. If you have a 457(b) plan that has received rollovers from other types of accounts, consult with your plan administrator on the details of early withdrawal. Non-governmental 457(b) plans are only allowed to accept incoming rollovers from other non-governmental 457(b)s, so withdrawals are always penalty-free.

Even though 457(b) money has no early withdrawal penalties, you should still make sure the distribution options fit within your plan. Governmental 457(b) plans have strict rules that generally prevent withdrawals while you're still employed at the plan sponsor. Once you leave that employer, governmental 457(b) plans usually have flexible distribution rules that allow for lump sum and installment distributions. Distribution options for non-governmental 457(b) plans are specific to a plan and are often very restrictive, sometimes to the point of it not making sense to use the plan in the first place.

===Roth accounts===

[[Roth IRA|Roth IRAs]] allow contributions to be withdrawn at any time tax- and penalty-free. The Roth IRA [[Roth_IRA#Distributions|distribution rules]] specify that all lifetime contributions come out first. Next, any Roth conversions you have done come out in the order you did them, grouped by year, with the taxable portion of each conversion (or group of conversions) coming out before the non-taxable portion. Earnings within the Roth IRA come out last. While many of the above exceptions can waive the early withdrawal penalty for a Roth IRA, only disability and the first-time home buyer exception can waive both early penalties ''and'' taxes, and only when it has been at least 5 years since you have set up and contributed to a Roth IRA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-publication-590-b| title=IRS Publication 590-B: Distributions from Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs)| publisher=Internal Revenue Service| accessdate=September 1, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

You can set up a [[Substantially equal periodic payments|SEPP]] from a Roth IRA, and it will waive the early withdrawal penalties, but it does ''not'' waive the taxes on any withdrawn gains. For this reason and others, pre-tax accounts tend to be the better choice for [[early retirement]]. 

If you withdraw from a designated Roth account (for example, a [[401(k)#Roth_401(k)|Roth 401(k)]]), the above exceptions will waive early withdrawal penalties, but the earnings that have accrued inside the account are still taxable until the account is ''qualified.'' The account becomes qualified when you have met the 5-year period of participation since your first contribution to this account, and you are either 59½ or disabled. For non-qualified withdrawals, earnings and basis are pro-rata; that is, each withdrawal is taken to be a mix of earnings and basis in the proportions that exist in the account at that time.

If you do a [[Roth conversion]] and withhold taxes from the conversion, the withholding is treated as distribution, and you will owe a 10% early withdrawal penalty if you are under age 59½, unless the amount withheld is rolled over to a Roth IRA or back into the traditional IRA.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc413 Topic no. 413, Rollovers from retirement plans | Internal Revenue Service]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Self-employed retirement accounts===

[[Solo 401(k) plan|Solo 401(k)s]] and [[SEP|SEP-IRAs]] are commonly-used retirement accounts by self-employed (for example, independent contractor) investors, and have the same 10% penalty for early withdrawals before age 59½. Solo 401(k)s have the same exceptions as qualified employer plans, and SEP-IRAs have the same exceptions as IRAs; see [[#Retirement_accounts|above]]. 

[[SIMPLE IRA|SIMPLE IRAs]] have a 10% penalty for early withdrawals before age 59½, and the same exceptions as for an IRA, but this penalty increases to '''25%''' for withdrawals within the first two years of plan participation. This time period begins on the first day a contribution is deposited into your account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/retirement-plans-faqs-regarding-simple-ira-plans| title=SIMPLE IRA plan FAQs| publisher=IRS| accessdate=August 27, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) have a '''20%''' early withdrawal penalty if you make a non-qualified withdrawal (that is, not for a qualified medical expense&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Qualified medical expenses are determined by [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p502.pdf IRS Publication 502].&lt;/ref&gt;) before age 65, ''and'' the withdrawal is taxable income. After age 65, the early withdrawal penalty no longer applies, but non-qualified withdrawals are taxable, so the account behaves similarly to a [[traditional IRA]] when used in this way. Qualified withdrawals are always tax- and penalty-free.

You can access money from an HSA anytime tax- and penalty-free for current medical expenses, and also past medical expenses for which you have saved receipts, as long as you had an HSA at the time the expense was incurred. A [[Health_savings_account#During_working_years|common tactic]] is to defer reimbursement of medical expenses from an HSA to retirement years, leaving money inside to grow tax-deferred or tax-free, so you may have a large repository of past receipts you can use for withdrawals. It's usually better to take qualified HSA withdrawals before retirement account withdrawals; see: [[Retirement draw-down priority]].

Because significant future medical expenses are likely, especially later in life, it usually does not make sense to make taxable withdrawals unless you need the money and most other funding sources have been exhausted. Taking non-qualified withdrawals before age 65 incurs ''both'' taxes and the large 20% penalty, neither of which you would pay if you later withdrew the money for medical expenses, and so should only be used a last resort.

==Annuities==

Annuities are a very broad class of financial products. Many types of annuities have a 10% early withdrawal penalty for withdrawals before age 59½, like [[#Retirement_accounts|retirement accounts]]. A similar list of exceptions is listed in [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p575.pdf IRS Pub 575].

In addition to IRS-imposed early withdrawal penalties, many annuity contracts also have surrender charges that can be quite severe for early withdrawals. Before taking any withdrawals, make sure you understand your annuity's rules for withdrawals.

When separating from an employer, former employees often face the question of what to do with money they have invested in that employer's workplace retirement plan (for example, a [[401(k)]], [[403(b)]], or [[457(b)]]).  '''Retirement account at a former employer''' describes the options available to you.

Generally, the options are to [[IRA rollovers and transfers|roll over]] the money into a new plan, roll it out into an [[IRA]], or leave it in the old plan. The best choice depends on a variety of factors, including whether you are continuing to work or retiring.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;[[IRA#Comparison to employer accounts|Comparison between IRAs and employer plans]] contains a comprehensive comparison of features offered by various plans.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==If you are still working==

===Option 1: Roll it into the new employer's plan===

For this to be an option, you must be eligible to participate in the plan, the plan must have the same tax type (for example, Roth) as the money you are rolling in, and the plan must accept incoming [[IRA rollovers and transfers|rollovers]] (many, but not all do). 

Rolling money into the new employer's plan has the advantage of simplicity, especially if you will be contributing to the new plan. It gives you one less account to keep track of and potentially forget about, and makes managing investments and [[rebalancing]] easier. 

The value of this option strongly depends on the quality of the new plan, particularly the fees and investment choices. It's not necessary for the plan to have many good funds; a [[Three-fund portfolio|good portfolio]] can be build around a few or even one good fund. But, [[Expense ratios|fees and expenses]], both within [[Mutual fund|mutual funds]] inside the plan, and possibly added on top of the fund fees, can [[How_much_do_you_lose_to_annual_fees_after_many_years%3F|heavily erode]] your long-term investment performance. See: [[#Investments_in_employer_plans|Investments in employer plans]] below. 

If the new employer's plan is an [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employee_Retirement_Income_Security_Act_of_1974 ERISA]-governed plan, there is also an [[asset protection]] benefit to rolling money in. Assets in ERISA plans get federal protection from creditors and bankruptcy. See: [[Asset_protection#Investing_in_a_401(k)|Asset protection in a 401(k)]]. 

Other potential benefits include:
*If you plan to retire between ages 55 and 59½, any money you roll in can be withdrawn penalty-free thanks to the [[Rule of 55]]. 
*If the new employer's plan has a [[Early_withdrawal#Plan_loans|loan feature]], you can take a plan loan using rolled-in money.
*If you might work past the age when [[Required Minimum Distribution|Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs)]] start (as of 2025, 73 or 75 for those not already facing RMDs), there is an advantage to rolling pre-tax money into your new employer's plan. RMDs are not required from employer plan accounts if you are still working.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;This is true as long as you own less than 5% of the company. If you own at least 5% of the employer, RMDs are required once you reach RMD age, whether you are still working or not. Most commonly, this affects small business owners and investors with a [[Solo 401k|Solo 401(k)]].&lt;/ref&gt; Because the US generally has [[Progressive tax|progressive]] tax rates, taking RMDs while also earning a substantial income can cause you to pay higher tax rates on those withdrawals than you would later.

If the new employer's plan has reasonable investments and low fees, this is an excellent option and should be the default choice for pre-tax (also known as "traditional") assets. 

===Option 2: Roll it out into an IRA===

{{Quote
|quote=[The IRA rollover market] is fraught with risks for you. You could pick the wrong product, pay too much in fees, or needlessly give up a standout 401(k)—all of which could add up to a less comfortable retirement.
|source=&amp;mdash;Ian Salisbury in [https://money.com/collection-post/why-rolling-over-401k-ira-important-retirement/ Why is rolling over my 401(k) such a big deal?], Money magazine, July 2014.}}
You can always [[IRA rollovers and transfers|roll out]] money from a former employer into either a [[traditional IRA]] or [[Roth IRA]] (depending on the tax type of the money). It is easy to find IRAs with good investments and very low fees, so this not a concern like for an employer plan. The parameters of this option depend on whether the money is pre-tax or Roth, and you can make a separate decision for each tax type - for example, rolling pre-tax money into a new employer's plan, and rolling Roth money out into a Roth IRA.

Novice investors can be manipulated into purchasing inappropriate investments in an IRA by self-interested brokers, whereas in a 401(k) plan, even an expensive one, participants typically have some protection from poor investment choices. If rolling money out into an IRA, be very cautious of sales agents or financial advisors selling loaded mutual funds, complex products like [[Variable annuity|variable annuities]], or private investments. If you have any doubts about an investment, pay for a consult with a fee-only fiduciary [[Investment advisor|financial planner]] or ask on the [https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/index.php Bogleheads forum].

Rollover IRAs retain unlimited bankruptcy protection per federal law,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.kiplinger.com/retirement/iras/is-your-ira-protected-in-bankruptcy| title=Is Your IRA Protected from Creditors in Bankruptcy? | publisher=Kiplinger| author=Donna Levalley| date=June 26, 2025| accessdate=September 2, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas contributory IRAs have a limit on the amount exempted from bankruptcy. Both rollover and contributory IRAs get [[Asset_protection#Investing_in_an_IRA|state-level protection]] from general creditor claims, which may be inferior to the protection of an ERISA employer plan but varies widely by state. This is one reason to keep rollover IRAs separate and not make any contributions to them - you need to be able to prove the rollover IRA monies are from the 401k.

====Pre-tax money====

Rolling out pre-tax money into a traditional IRA has the disadvantage that it interferes with the [[Backdoor Roth|Backdoor Roth IRA]] process, making it not work as intended. If your income makes you ineligible for direct contribution to a Roth IRA, or even if this could happen in the foreseeable future, and you want the ability to contribute to a Roth IRA, that is a clear disadvantage of rolling pre-tax money out into an IRA.

If the amount of pre-tax money is relatively small (maybe a few $10,000s or less) and you want to preserve the ability to make Backdoor Roth IRA contributions, and none of the other options are good, you could consider [[Roth conversion|converting]] the money to a Roth IRA. The converted amount becomes taxable income in that year, but the money will be tax-free going forward. Though it might not be the optimal mathematical decision, it would get the money into a good account and simplify things, and that has value. 

If you have a large pre-tax balance, converting it all to a Roth IRA is usually a poor tax planning decision, as you will likely pay a lower rate withdrawing that money in retirement, given that the conversion income will stack on top of your earned income this year and the US has a [[Progressive tax|progressive]] tax system. But, if you expect your tax rate to be unusually low - for example, if you separate from your employer early in the year and take a lot of time off between jobs - it could make sense to convert a larger balance to Roth. Taxable Roth conversions are a complex tax planning decision.

If you roll pre-tax money out into a [[rollover IRA]], it is best practice to not make any ''contributions'' into that IRA. If you wish to make IRA contributions, open a separate IRA account and contribute there. Some employer plans will only accept incoming rollovers from rollover IRAs that have not had contributions, and if you later decide to roll money into an employer plan, keeping rollover money separate will avoid this problem. It may also have asset protection benefits. 

====Roth money====

Rolling Roth money from an employer plan into a [[Roth IRA]] is usually the best choice. Roth IRAs always allow contributions to be withdrawn tax- and penalty-free at any time, and any contributions you made into the old employer's designated Roth account also count toward this amount. Therefore, in an emergency, having easier access to that money is a clear advantage. There is also a general benefit to having money in an account that you control, versus your employer.

There are a few potential disadvantages to rolling employer plan money into a Roth IRA, the main one being [[asset protection]]. Check the asset protection laws in your state to see how much protection they give to Roth IRAs versus the old employer's plan, which likely gets ERISA protection. Also consider that you might later move to a state that gives Roth IRAs less protection. Another potential disadvantage is if the old employer's plan has unusually good investments; see [[#Investments_in_employer_plans|Investments in employer plans]] below. 

Rolling employer plan money into a Roth IRA is not reversible; the IRS does not allow rollovers from a Roth IRA into a employer plan's designated Roth account.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-tege/rollover_chart.pdf IRS Rollover Chart]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Option 3: Leave it in the old employer's plan===

Leaving money in the old employer's plan is always an option, except if the balance is so small that they can involuntarily roll the money out into an IRA (less than $7,000) or cash it out (less than $1,000).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-publication-560| title=Publication 560 (2024), Retirement Plans for Small Business | publisher=Internal Revenue Service| accessdate=September 2, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A downside of leaving money in the employer's plan is that you have one more account to keep track of and possibly forget. It makes managing your investments more complicated.

Another downside is that there may be unforeseen circumstances which will result in difficulties obtaining your funds at a later time. For example, the company may go out of business, be resold, or not keep adequate records. While you are legally entitled to your funds, the practicality of these unplanned situations can result in significant delays or nonpayment. For these reasons, many people recommended to not leave your 401(k) money with a former employer.&lt;ref&gt;{{forum link| t=57457| title=401(k) Vesting Dispute - Need Advice| date=July 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consider the fees and investment choices in the old plan. If it has high fees, that would be a strong reason to roll the money out. The old plan could have unusual investments with lower fees and/or could be uniquely valuable compared to what you can get in an IRA; see: [[#Investments_in_employer_plans|Investments in employer plans]] below.

If the old plan has a loan feature, you generally cannot take a plan loan after you separate from service. 

If the old plan is a governmental [[457(b)]], it has no early (that is, before age 55 or 59½) withdrawal penalties. This benefit is lost if you roll the money out into an IRA or into a non-457(b) workplace plan. If you think there's a chance you will want to access the money early, that would be a compelling reason to leave money in a governmental 457(b).

Nonetheless, if there are issues with the other options, leaving money in an old employer's plan can be worth this extra complexity and risk. Most commonly, this would occur when you have a large pre-tax balance, the new employer's plan isn't great (or doesn't accept incoming rollovers), and you wish to make [[Backdoor Roth|Backdoor Roth IRA]] contributions. 

===Option 4: Start a business and roll it into a Solo 401(k)===

{{Warning|Starting a business and opening a Solo 401(k) are complex tasks with many opportunities for costly mistakes, which financial novices should not attempt on their own.}}

If you start a business (or already have one) and open a [[Solo 401(k) plan|Solo 401(k)]] that accepts incoming rollovers, you can roll over money from the old employer's plan into the Solo 401(k). Two clear advantages of this option are that pre-tax money in a Solo 401(k) does not interfere with the [[Backdoor Roth|Backdoor Roth IRA]] process, and it's easy to find free or inexpensive Solo 401(k) plans with good investments and low fees. 

However, this process is much more complex than the other options:

*You must have a legitimate business, meaning an activity that you '''intend to do regularly and for profit'''. If you end up deciding to discontinue the business after some time, that’s OK. But if it’s obviously a sham business, you run a huge risk – the IRS can forcibly dissolve it and your Solo 401k, making you pay income tax and penalties on all the money you have in there. 
*You may need to get a business license from your local government and/or some kind of permit at the federal or state level
*You have to actually earn a profit in the year you want to open the plan, though there’s no limit on how small it can be (for example, $10).
*Get an EIN (employer identification number) from the IRS. This is free and easy.
*Open a Solo 401k ('''not''' a [[SEP|SEP-IRA]]) that accepts incoming rollovers. Most, but not all, of the free plans accept incoming rollovers.
*If/when you have more than $250,000 in the plan, you have to file a [https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-5500-ez Form 5500-EZ] every year to report the plan’s assets and some other details. It’s free and can be done online, but the penalties for failing to file are enormous. 

If your business has employees other than your spouse, you would need to open a "real" (non-Solo) [[401(k)]]. But, if that plan accepts incoming rollovers it would function in the same way as as a Solo 401(k). 

Depending on the state you live in, there may be additional fees or taxes to set up and maintain a business, and these would have to be weighted against the benefits of this option. 

Going through all this trouble just to create a better home for your pre-tax retirement money will not be worth it for most investors. This option is only recommended for someone who is a hobbyist and likes getting into the details of this stuff, ''and'' has an idea for a legitimate business that would pass an IRS audit.

===Option 5: Cash it out===

This is usually advisable only if you need the money immediately. Not only will you forfeit tax-advantaged growth, but you will pay taxes on the distribution. There may also be a 10% penalty if you are under age 59½, unless the plan is with an employer from whom you retired in or after the year you reached age 55.

==When you are retired==

When you retire, the choices are simpler. Many of the parameters are the same as when working, although there are a few additional things to consider.

===Option 1: Roll it out into an IRA===

When retiring, rolling both pre-tax and Roth money from an employer into traditional and Roth IRAs is usually the right choice. Advantages are that you get a wide variety of investment choices and low fees in an account under your complete control. Employers can change their plan terms and investment options, or add fees. Though less common, employers can lose records, go out of business, or be bought out, all of which can complicate you getting access to your money. In rare cases, employers or people working for them have stolen plan money. The risk of serious problems is low, but there is a general advantage to removing an employer from the picture.

Consolidating all your retirement assets into one or two IRAs of each tax type makes investment management, [[rebalancing]], and [[Required Minimum Distribution|Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs)]] simpler. See also: [[Required_Minimum_Distribution#Combining_distributions_from_multiple_accounts|Combining RMDs from multiple accounts]]. 

===Option 2: Leave it in the old employer's plan===

While rolling money out into an IRA when retiring should be the default choice, there are several reasons why it might be better to leave money in an employer plan. These reasons include:

*The plan may have ultra-low fee funds and/or uniquely valuable investments compared to what you can get in an IRA; see [[#Investments_in_employer_plans|Investments in employer plans]]
*If you are retiring before age 59½, but in or after the year you turn 55, you can withdraw money from the plan penalty-free by way of the [[Rule of 55]].
*If the plan is a governmental [[457(b)]], it has no early withdrawal penalties. If there's a chance you will want to access the money before age 59½, that would be an advantage for leaving money in the 457(b). 
*Especially if it's an ERISA plan, the employer plan probably has better [[asset protection]] than an IRA. 

====Solo 401(k)====

If you are retiring with a [[Solo 401(k) plan|Solo 401(k)]], the parameters are different than choosing to leave money in a large-employer plan. A Solo 401(k) behaves more like an IRA; as you are the employer, you have a similarly high degree of control over the account, and no risks of issues (like the employer being bought out) that could interfere with your access to the money. 

You are generally allowed to leave a business open even if you are not earning any income, as long as there is a potential for future income. However, your state may charge taxes or fees for keeping the business open, and you may have costs for maintaining the plan. If the Solo 401(k) has more than $250,000 in assets, you have to file an annual Form 5500-EZ. For these reasons, if it's likely you won't be earning more income, rolling the money out into an IRA is usually the best option.

==Less common situations==

There are some less common situations that can affect the parameters of the choices above. Retirement account rules are complex, and this is a non-exhaustive list.

*Rarely, employer plans will allow incoming rollovers even for employees who have separated. If you have a former employer plan like this, that adds an additional option to the decision.
*[[Roth conversion|Roth conversions]] from a traditional IRA are always allowed, but many employer plans don't allow Roth conversions of pre-tax money inside the plan. If you might want to do Roth conversions while working - this is often undesirable because conversion income will stack on top of your earned income, and tax rates are progressive, though exceptional cases exist - and the available employer plans do not allow in-plan Roth rollovers, then there is an advantage to leaving some pre-tax money in an IRA. 
*One benefit of a [[Solo 401(k) plan|Solo 401(k)]] over an IRA is that they are not subject to Unrelated Debt Financed Income (UDFI) on leveraged real estate investments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irafinancial.com/blog/understanding-the-udfi-exception-for-solo-401k-real-estate-investors/| title=Understanding The UDFI Exception for Solo 401(k) Real Estate Investors| publisher=IRAFinancial| date=July 16, 2025| accessdate=August 26, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would only be an issue for a custom Solo 401(k) plan where you are directly investing in real estate. If you are, this would be an advantage for leaving money in the Solo 401(k), even if there are annual costs for keeping the plan open.

==Investments in employer plans==

Employer plans only offer a set of investments selected by the plan provider, usually in the range of one to several dozen options. They may include some good fund choices, but some or all could be high-fee actively managed funds. These choices contrast with IRAs, which have an enormous range of options, including stocks, bonds, mutual funds, ETFs, CDs, Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), and even some derivatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.schwab.com/learn/story/trading-options-retirement-account| title=What Options Strategies Are Allowed in an IRA?| publisher=Charles Schwab| date=August 13, 2025| accessdate=September 12, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, employer plans have commonly had high fees, both inside the funds and sometimes added on top of the fund expenses. [[403(b)]] plans have been notorious for offering high-fee annuities. For these reasons, in the past many financial experts have recommended by default that you should roll employer plan money out into an IRA when you separate from the employer. 

However, employer plan fees have come down in recent decades, particularly at larger employers. Many plans now include low-fee [[index fund]] choices and have only small or no additional fees paid by the participants. And, the [[Bogleheads® investment philosophy]] does not require a large number of funds to build a good portfolio; [[Three-fund portfolio|three good funds]] should be plenty, and if you have assets other places (spouse's plan, IRAs, [[Taxable account|brokerage]], etc.), a portfolio can be build around a plan with only one good fund. Therefore, rolling former employer plan money into an IRA should no longer be the default choice, even though it will be the right choice in some situations - especially with [[#Roth_money|Roth money]]. 

Some employer plans may even offer ''better'' investments that can be purchased in an IRA, or unusual investments that might be valuable to certain investors. Example may include:

*Ultra-low fee "institutional-class" funds - though in practice this benefit may be negligible or non-existent; see [[#Expense_ratios|below]]
*[[Collective Investment Trusts]], which may have substantially lower fees than their retail investment counterparts
*A [[stable value fund]], purportedly offering bond-like returns with cash-like risk
*Private investments, such as real estate funds
*Annuities - While many employer plans have historically had only poor-quality high-fee annuities, more now have better annuities. If you are in the market for an annuity and your employer plan offers annuities that are as good or even better than what you can get on the retail market, that could be a good reason to leave money in an employer plan. 
*An [[Employee Stock Ownership Plan|Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP)]], allowing appreciated stock to be withdrawn and gains to be taxed at lower long-term capital gains tax rates using [[net unrealized appreciation]]

===Expense ratios===

Some employer plans leverage economies of scale and offer funds with lower expense ratios, based on the larger asset base available within the plan. For example, the Vanguard Institutional Plus Index Fund [https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/mutual-funds/profile/VIIIX VIIIX] (an S&amp;P 500 index fund) has a 0.02% expense ratio, compared to its retail counterparts [https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/mutual-funds/profile/VFIAX VFIAX] and [https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/voo VOO], which have 0.04% and 0.03% expense ratios respectively. The practical difference is quite small - $10 or $20 per year per $100,000 invested - and is unlikely to make a meaningful difference in your investing performance, but is not completely worthless. 

Also note that Fidelity offers S&amp;P 500 and total US stock market index funds, [https://fundresearch.fidelity.com/mutual-funds/summary/315911750 FXAIX] and [https://fundresearch.fidelity.com/mutual-funds/summary/315911693 FSKAX], with 0.015% expense ratios. Schwab and iShares also offer a variety of funds with expense ratios in this range. At these tiny levels of fees, other factors like how accurately the fund tracks the index, which and how many stocks are in the index, and (if in a [[taxable account]]) small differences in [[Tax-efficient fund placement|tax efficiency]], can have a larger impact than these fee differences. 

As of 2025, both [[Fidelity]] and [[E*TRADE]] offer zero-fee mutual funds, which can be purchased inside an IRA. Fidelity's zero-fee funds have been around for a few years, and the data do show a very small benefit in total return compared to low-fee index funds like those from Vanguard. Commentators have raised concerns over a possibly lower tax efficiency,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.whitecoatinvestor.com/expense-ratios/| title=Does Expense Ratio Really Matter?| publisher=White Coat Investor| date=August 6, 2018| accessdate=September 12, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also a lack of portability to another broker, but neither of these are problems for IRA investments. The bottom line is that while ultra-low fee funds are nice, very low or zero-fee options also exist for IRAs, and any differences are too small to be meaningful.

      <text bytes="7057" sha1="4wa3ntou1ooanrc2g5xsa7l4n04c8rm" xml:space="preserve">The '''[[Thrift Savings Plan]]''' offers participants five '''Lifecycle''' funds containing a mix of the TSP's five core funds. The Lifecycle funds are [[Target date retirement funds]], with the same expenses as the other TSP funds.

== Composition ==
=== Glide path ===
The charts and data below, one separate tabs of the embedded spreadsheet, show the [[Glide paths|glide path]] of the Lifecycle funds, using data as of January 18, 2018.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;[https://www.tsp.gov/investmentfunds/lfundsheet/fundPerformance_L.shtml Lifecycle Fund Performance] at https://www.tsp.gov as of 18 January 2018. Readers are encouraged to visit the TSP site for up-to-date compositions of the Lifecycle Funds.&lt;/ref&gt;

General themes of the Lifecycle funds glide path:

* The glide paths shift toward bond funds over the years, as expected.
* Within the bonds allocations, the allocation shifts more toward G Fund and away from the F Fund as retirement age is reached.
* Within the US equity allocation, there is a slight shift from the S Fund (small cap) toward the C Fund (large cap) as retirement age is reached.
* The US to International equity ratio stays at 70:30 through the entire glide path.

The various tabs (click each tab's hyperlink to view) depict:

* '''TSP Lifecycle Glide Path''' - Illustrates how each decade, the holdings in the three equity funds gradually decline, while the G Fund steadily climbs until the G Fund becomes 74% of the holdings when the Income phase is reached. The sky blue line labeled '''Equity''' shows the overall equity percentage of each fund (C Fund + S Fund + I Fund).
* '''Glide Path''' - displays the equity percentage (C Fund + S Fund + I Fund) of each Lifecycle fund, starting in year 2018 (representing the L 2050 fund) through the 40 years ending with the L Income fund. Note that the data points are in ten-year intervals, so the actual glide path is a gentler slope. For comparison, [[Vanguard target retirement funds | Vanguard Target Retirement Date funds]] and Fidelity Freedom Funds of the same year are shown. 
* '''Fixed Income Glide Path''' - Many TSP investors question how much G Fund to hold relative to the F Fund and other fixed income assets. This decision can be informed by the prescribed holdings of the G Fund and F Fund in the Lifecycle funds, relative to the investor's point in time in their investment lifetime. The chart on this tab shows how in the Lifecycle fund, the F Fund starts at 6 percent for the youngest investor, and stays at almost that same percentage all the way through retirement age. By comparison, the G Fund starts out with an allocation nearly double the F Fund and then climbs steadily over the decades, increasingly so over the five years before the "Income" year is reached.
* '''Fixed Income as Percentage''' - shows the relative holdings of the G Fund and F Fund and compares their relative weights as the two components of the fixed income portion of the portfolio, across the decades of the Lifecycle funds. The F Fund proportion starts out as roughly one-third of the overall fixed income allocation, and steadily decreases over the years.
* '''US Stocks as Percentage''' - shows the relative holdings of the C Fund and S Fund and compares their relative weights across the decades of the Lifecycle funds. There is a slight shift toward C Fund (large-cap) and away from S Fund (small-cap) as the glide path goes from the younger investor toward retirement income phase.
* '''US vs International''' - shows that the US equity (C Fund + S Fund) to International equity (I Fund) ratio stays constant at 70:30 for all Lifecycle funds.

Note that these curves were auto-created by Google Spreadsheets. A more careful look at the glide path reveals that the rise in G Fund, and the attendant decline in the other four funds, occurs more dramatically in the final five years before the the Income level arrives, than is depicted in the smoother blue line in the chart. Also, be aware that the data points in these spreadsheet are separated by ten years; the lines between the data points in this graph are "straighter" than they truly are in real life. In real life the lines will be smoother.

== Role in portfolio ==
TSP investors considering a Lifecycle fund should consider the same questions that investors in any target date retirement fund must weigh. See [[Target date retirement funds]] for a review of these general considerations.

Issues of concern to TSP investors in particular include:
* The fact that the [[I Fund]] is not a complete international fund may lead some investors to not use the Lifecycle fund in favor of using individual funds and holding the international allocation outside the TSP. This concern will become moot in 2018 or 2019 because on December 6, 2017, the TSP's governing board "at its most recent meeting accepted a recommendation by a consultant to switch to linking the I Fund to the [[MSCI]] All Country World Index, which covers non-U.S. developed markets, smaller companies and emerging markets."&lt;ref name="fedw_TSPt"&gt;{{Cite web | title = TSP to Change I Fund Index, Leave Others as Is | publisher = FEDweek | date = 2017-12-06 | accessdate = 2017-12-08 | url = http://www.fedweek.com/fedweek/tsp-change-fund-index-leave-others/ | quote = The board at its most recent meeting accepted a recommendation by a consultant to switch to linking the I Fund to the MSCI All Country World Index, which covers non-U.S. developed markets, smaller companies and emerging markets.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Forum link|t=233929|title=Thrift Savings Plan to Change I Fund Index|date=December 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The change could take a year or more to implement.
* The TSP Lifecycle funds employ an active investing approach for setting the funds' glide paths, which is based on efficient frontier analysis using capital market assumptions over a 20-year time horizon and stochastic modeling projections for inflation, economic growth, salary growth, corporate profits, P/E rations, interest rates, and exchange rates.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;See: {{cite web| url=https://www.frtib.gov/pdf/minutes/MM-2016Nov-Att6.pdf| title=Thrift Savings Plan Lifecycle Fund Asset Allocation| publisher=Mercer| date=November 2016}}{{dead link}}&lt;/ref&gt; Investors looking for a passive approach may want to use individual funds and look to Vanguard, Fidelity, or another large fund family for examples of target date glide paths.

      <text bytes="7095" sha1="kefk6jztf3cgp9y2znc4i9vs3qozmgi" xml:space="preserve">The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' (International Stock Index Investment Fund) is one of six investment offerings inside the [[Thrift Savings Plan]], a contributory retirement program for United States federal employees, members of the uniformed services, and their beneficiaries.

==Fundamentals==
The I Fund is an international developed market stock [[Collective Investment Trusts|collective investment trust]].&lt;ref group="note"&gt; Technically, the I Fund is a collective investment trust. The main practical  differences between a collective investment trust and a mutual fund are:
# A collective investment trust has no ticker. An investor gets performance information about the fund from the fund administrator through performance reports and fact sheets.
# A collective investment trust does not distribute dividends or capital gains, but accumulates these incomes in the fund [[Net asset value| net asset value]].

The I Fund's collective trust manager is BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. For more information regarding collective trusts, see [[Collective Investment Trusts]] &lt;/ref&gt; The fund tracks the MSCI ACWI IMI ex USA ex China ex Hong Kong Index, which covers the stock markets of twenty-one developed countries and twenty-three emerging markets.

On December 6, 2017, the TSP's governing board "at its most recent meeting accepted a recommendation by a consultant to switch to linking the I Fund to the [[MSCI]] All Country World Index, which covers non-U.S. developed markets, smaller companies and emerging markets."&lt;ref name="fedw_TSPt"&gt;{{Cite web | title = TSP to Change I Fund Index, Leave Others as Is | author =  | publisher = FEDweek | date = 2017-12-06 | accessdate = 2017-12-08 | url = http://www.fedweek.com/fedweek/tsp-change-fund-index-leave-others/ | quote = The board at its most recent meeting accepted a recommendation by a consultant to switch to linking the I Fund to the MSCI All Country World Index, which covers non-U.S. developed markets, smaller companies and emerging markets.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Forum post|t=233929|title=Thrift Savings Plan to Change I Fund Index|date=December 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the November 28, 2017 meeting of the TSP Governing Board, it was stated: "The target date for the change would be some time in 2019,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board|date=|title=Minutes of the Meeting of the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board Members, November 24, 2017|url=https://minutes.frtib.gov/meeting_minutes/2017/2017Nov.zip|accessdate=|publisher=frtib.gov|type=ZIP}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the TSP stated at the end of 2018 that the switch would occur in the second half of 2020, due to timelines related to the assignment of a new fund manager contract for the TSP funds.&lt;ref name="frti_"&gt;{{Cite web|author=Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board|date=2018-12-27|title=Minutes of the Meeting of the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board Members, December 27, 2108|url=https://minutes.frtib.gov/meeting_minutes/2018/2018Dec.zip|access-date=|publisher=frtib.gov|type=ZIP|quote=Lastly, [TSP CIO] Mr. McCaffrey stated the multi-manager effort, as it is known, includes the I Fund. This means two things: 1) FRTIB will suspend previously announced plans for the re-competition of the I Fund on a single manager basis because that effort will be bundled with the multi-manager initiative. 2) The second issue is that the planned transition of the I Fund benchmark from the MSCI EAFE Index to the MSCI ACWI ex-US IMI Index was intended to be assigned with the new I Fund manager contract. That benchmark change will continue to await the assignment of a new primary manager for the I Fund. As a result, the benchmark transition should be concluded within 6 months of the new contract award, meaning the second half of 2020.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pion_Forl"&gt;{{Cite web |title=For largest U.S. retirement fund, the sky's the limit |author=Brian Croce | publisher=Pensions &amp; Investments |access-date=13 February 2019 |url= https://www.pionline.com/article/20190204/PRINT/190209965/for-largest-us-retirement-fund-the-skys-the-limit|quote=By the end of 2019, the [Federal Retirement Thrift Investment] board will issue a request for proposal seeking two investment managers to manage a portion of each of the index funds, according to Kim Weaver, director of external affairs, [...] 'and a decision will be reached sometime in 2020', she added. Once the managers are selected, a change will be made to the TSP's I Fund — one of the index funds that invests in international equities — to incorporate emerging markets, Ms. Weaver said.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At its May 13, 2020 meeting the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board unanimously passed a motion to delay, pending further study, the implementation of the I Fund benchmark change to the MSCI ACWI ex US Investible Market Index from the MSCI EAFE Index. The stated rationale was “the meaningful different economic environment related in large part to the impact of the global Covid-19 pandemic, as well as the nomination of 3 new FRTIB Board members.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Forum link|title=Re: Wiki - Approximating total international stock market - update for TSP|p=5897382|author=MichDad|date=March 22, 2021}} and {{cite web|date=May 13, 2020|title=Minutes of the Meeting of the Board Members|url=https://minutes.frtib.gov/meeting_minutes/2020/2020May30.zip|access-date=|publisher=Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board|type=ZIP}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of July 31, 2024, the I Fund benchmark has been updated to the MSCI ACWI IMI ex USA ex China ex Hong Kong Index.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Thrift Savings Plan I Fund International Stock Index Investment Fund | author=The Thrift Savings Plan|publisher=tsp.gov | date = 2024-09-03 | accessdate = 2024-09-10 | url = https://www.tsp.gov/funds-individual/i-fund}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role in a portfolio==
The MSCI ACI IMI ex USA ex China ex Hong Kong Index includes 5000+ stocks from 21 developed markets and 23 emerging markets.

The 21 developed markets are those in the [[MSCI EAFE index|MSCI EAFE]] index minus Hong Kong plus Canada. The 23 emerging markets match the offering in the MSCI ACWI IMI ex USA index minus China.

The index includes large, mid, and small caps. It covers approximately 99% of global market cap minus the USA, China, and Hong Kong.

TSP investors seeking to round out the gaps in the I Fund can consider the following:
* Supplement with iShares MSCI China ETF (MCHI): 0.59% expense ratio as of October 13, 2024.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title =  iShares MSCI China ETF | author=iShares by Blackrock|publisher=ishares.com | date = 2024-10-11 | accessdate = 2024-10-13 | url = https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239619/ishares-msci-china-etf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Or, they can place all of their international investments with Vanguard (for example, in the [{{Vf | 0113}} Vanguard Total International Stock Market Fund]).

The [[Thrift Savings Plan]] is regulated by most of the same rules as [[Employee Retirement Income Security Act]] (ERISA) plans like [[401(k)]]s. The IRS explains what plans ''may'' do, must do, and may not do. A plan may not do what it is not allowed to do by the IRS, and a plan is not required to do what it may do. This page examines some of the contrasts between the TSP and 401(k) plans in general.

Although the TSP currently has less flexibility in some areas compared to some 401(k) plans, the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board is examining rules changes that could offer participants more options such as in-plan Roth conversions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Forum link | t=140180 |title=Improving the TSP for current participants|date=24 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contrasts ==
=== In-plan Roth conversions ===
While [[401(k)]] plans with a traditional and Roth option ''may'' allow in-plan conversions from traditional to Roth, the TSP does not. As of November 2013, the TSP is studying the idea of permitting in-plan Roth conversions and has listed this as an initiative for further action in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{forum link| t=131963 |title=Possible TSP Changes| date=January 30, 2014}}, with a link to Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board's November 2013 minutes.&lt;/ref&gt; A communication from the TSP in August, 2014, indicated further progress in this effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{Forum link| p=2158467 | title=Improving the TSP for current participants | date=August 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Partial withdrawals ===
Prior to the enactment of the [[TSP Modernization Act of 2017]], the TSP allowed separated employees to make a single lifetime [[TSP_withdrawals#Partial|partial withdrawal]], for example to a traditional or Roth [[IRA]].  With the act now implemented, both current and separated employees may make multiple partial withdrawals

=== Incoming rollovers into the plan ===
{{See also|TSP transfers and rollovers}}
The IRS permits employer sponsored retirement to allow participants to roll over certain eligible accounts into the plan, such as IRAs or 401(k)s from previous jobs. While these plans are ''permitted'' to offer this option, they are not required to, and many 401(k) plans have different rules on whether a participant is allowed to roll over an account into their 401(k) plan. Additionally, while most plans will allow current employees to roll over assets into the plan, many plans will not allow former employees to do so.

The TSP allows both current and separated employees to roll over traditional pre-tax IRAs and eligible employer plans into their TSP accounts.

Only Roth 401(k)s can be rolled into the Roth TSP; Roth IRAs may not be. This restriction applies to employer plans in general, and not just the TSP, as described in [[IRA_rollovers_and_transfers#Roth_IRA| IRA Rollovers and Transfers - Roth IRA]].

Note that direct beneficiaries (a surviving person who inherited a TSP account from their spouse and chose to stay in the TSP) cannot roll over or transfer money into a beneficiary TSP account; see [[TSP estate planning]] for more.

=== Beneficiaries ===
{{main|TSP estate planning}}
There are some important considerations in how the TSP handles beneficiaries compared to what eligible plans may or may not offer. See linked page for more details.

=== Mutual fund window ===

Many retirement plans offer participants the option to invest their assets in a [[Self directed brokerage account|self-directed brokerage window]] that would offer a wider selection of investment options than just the core TSP funds.  The TSP now has a [[Thrift_Savings_Plan#Mutual_fund_window|mutual fund window]], allowing investments in mutual funds, but not stocks or ETFs.  The window is also limited to 25% of the TSP balance, and with high fees.

The [[Thrift Savings Plan]] will accept transfers and rollovers from qualified plans like a [[401(k)]] or [[IRA]], even if the participant is no longer in Federal service. See Form TSP-60 (traditional TSP) and Form TSP-60-R (for Roth TSP) for precisely which plans are eligible for the TSP and Roth TSP.

Although the TSP will allow a transfer from a Roth 401(k) into a Roth TSP, the TSP cannot accept transfers from a [[Roth IRA]]&lt;ref name="tsp._TSP:"&gt;{{Cite web |title=TSP: Methods for Moving Your Money into Your TSP Account | publisher=TSP |access-date=3 March 2019 |url= https://www.tsp.gov/PlanParticipation/EligibilityAndContributions/RolloversTransfers/methods.html#rollingOver}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to IRS rules that do not allow Roth IRAs to roll over into qualified retirement plans like 401(k) plans and the TSP.&lt;ref name="irs._Reti"&gt;{{Cite web |title=Retirement Plans FAQs regarding IRAs Rollovers and Roth Conversions |publisher=IRS |access-date=3 March 2019 |url= https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/retirement-plans-faqs-regarding-iras-rollovers-and-roth-conversions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transferring assets into the TSP can have many advantages, including:
* The TSP has extremely low-expense index funds.
* The TSP has the [[G Fund]], a unique fund available only to TSP participants.
* As a qualified employer plan, assets held in the TSP do not count toward [[Backdoor Roth IRA]] pro rata rules.
* Assets held in the TSP can be better [[Asset protection|protected from creditors]] compared to assets held in an IRA.

Disadvantages of transferring assets into the TSP include:
* Lack of exotic funds if you wish to invest beyond the TSP's broad market index funds.
* Inability to do [[Roth IRA conversion]] in the TSP, although the TSP is examining the idea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Forum link|t=110753|title=TSP looks to allow in-plan conversion|date=February 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Inability to hold a separate asset allocation in the Roth TSP portion compared to the traditional TSP portion.
* Required minimum distributions apply to both traditional and Roth balances and are paid proportionally from both balances.
* Lack of flexibility in [[TSP withdrawals]], although these shortcomings will be mostly removed with the enactment and eventual implementation of the [[TSP Modernization Act of 2017]]

In deciding whether and how much to transfer or roll over into the TSP, consider the above advantages and disadvantages. For example, if you like the G Fund but still want to hold other funds outside the TSP, then transfer or roll over just enough to fill your desired allocation in the G Fund, and leave the remaining assets outside the TSP.

== Contribution allocation ==
If you transfer or roll over assets into your TSP, they will be added to TSP funds following your '''Contribution Allocation''' percentages&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web| url=https://www.tsp.gov/planparticipation/contributions/contributionAllocations.shtml| title= Contribution Allocation| publisher=TSP}}&lt;/ref&gt; not your '''Distribution of Account''' percentages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.tsp.gov/planningtools/retirementplanning/earlyCareer.shtml| title=Retirement Planning Phases| publisher=TSP}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, especially if you are adding a large amount to the TSP, make sure your Contribution Allocation percentages are set to how you want to the incoming money to be allocated.

This can be an issue for TSP participants who have left service, and have subsequently changed their Distribution of Account percentages, but have not bothered to change their Contribution Allocation percentages because they are no longer contributing. For example, suppose have your entire TSP is in the G Fund (Treasuries), but back when you were a Federal employee, you set your contribution allocations to be 100% C Fund (S&amp;P 500 index) and have not changed since. You are preparing to roll over a 401(k) into the TSP and want it to go to the G Fund, and you might assume it will go to the G Fund to replicate what your current allocation. But if your contribution allocation is still 100% C Fund, then that is where your roll over will go.

You will then need to do an interfund transfer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.tsp.gov/planparticipation/interfund/IFTs.shtml| title=Interfund Transfer| publisher=TSP}}&lt;/ref&gt; to re-allocate the money where you ultimately want it to be, and accept the market's closing price that day. If the stock market goes up that day, you get lucky because you will be selling high. If it goes down, then you lose because you will have locked in your losses. The opposite could also happen if your contribution allocations were 100% G Fund back when you were an employee, but today you have all your assets in the C Fund and also want your rollover to go there. To minimize potential regret, ensure your Contribution Allocation is appropriate to how you want your assets to be distributed.

Participants in the Federal [[Thrift Savings Plan]] (TSP) have two options for withdrawing from a TSP account after leaving federal service. Participants can take '''{{PAGENAME}}''' as a partial withdrawal or a full withdrawal. Either type of withdrawal is now done on the TSP web site.

== Withdrawal options ==
{{Quotation|1=&lt;nowiki&gt;[A]&lt;/nowiki&gt;nyone who’s proposing that you leave the TSP and move your money to an individual retirement account has some serious explaining to do.
The investment industry is doing and saying anything it can to get at your TSP account, and it’s not your benefit it has in mind. I urge you to resist the temptation to believe there is some better solution to the problem of saving and investing for retirement. There is not.

At 2.5 basis points per year &lt;nowiki&gt;[3.8 as of 2017]&lt;/nowiki&gt; — those are one-hundredths of a percent — the TSP is the envy of private-sector investors and kryptonite to brokers, bankers and insurance agents. Make the most of the TSP, and you’ll reap the rewards. Fall for the sales pitch, and you’ll pay the price — literally.|author=Mike Miles|title=[http://money.federaltimes.com/2013/02/04/dont-overlook-tsp-for-lowest-cost-investment/ Don’t overlook TSP for lowest-cost investment]|source=Federal Times}}
See: [https://www.tsp.gov/planparticipation/withdrawals/withdrawingAccount.shtml TSP Withdrawals] at TSP.gov. Also, this article's [[Talk:TSP withdrawals|Discussion tab]] for a discussion of withdrawals for non-Roth accounts.

=== Partial ===
Since the enactment of the [[TSP Modernization Act of 2017]] on November 23, 2017, participants are no longer limited to a single partial withdrawal in their lifetime. Even while still employed, participants may make up to four withdrawals per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.tsp.gov/publications/tspbk12.pdf| title=TSP: In-Service Withdrawals}}&lt;/ref&gt; Withdrawals can be taken from Traditional balances only, Roth balances only, or pro rata from both.

Withdrawals are always distributed pro rata from the TSP funds, but this can be mitigated by doing an interfund transfer to restore the correct allocation. If you want to withdraw from the G Fund only, you can make your withdrawal, which will take some amount from the stock funds, then do an interfund transfer to move money from the G Fund back to the stock funds.

=== Full ===
Full withdrawals can be made as a single payment, life annuity, or as a series of monthly payments, which can be a specific dollar amount or based on life expectancy. Any combination of these three options may be used.&lt;ref name="tspbk25"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.tsp.gov/publications/tspbk25.pdf| title=TSP: Distributions}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the payments are a fixed dollar Aaount, the amount can be changed. If the payments are based on Life Expectancy, they can be stopped but not changed (although it should be possible to stop life expectancy payments and then start another withdrawal option).

=== Required Minimum Distribution ===
Required Minimum Distributions are required from the TSP under the same rules as for other employer plans:&lt;ref name="tspbk25" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.tsp.gov/publications/tspbk26.pdf| title=Tax Rules About TSP Payments}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.tsp.gov/news-and-resources/secure-2-0-and-the-tsp/| title=Secure 2.0 and the TSP}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Blockquote|The Internal Revenue Code (IRC) requires that you begin receiving distributions from your account in the calendar year you become age 73 and are separated from federal service. Your TSP traditional balance is subject to these required minimum distributions (RMDs). Roth balances do not require RMDs. If you have a civilian or uniformed services TSP account, we calculate RMDs using your age, your prior year-end account balance, and the IRS Uniform Lifetime Table.&lt;br&gt;
Any distributions you make while subject to RMDs will be used to satisfy the requirement. If the total amount of your distributions does not satisfy the requirement, we will issue a supplemental payment for the remaining amount before the deadline each year.}}

== Roth TSP ==
As an employer sponsored retirement plan, the Roth TSP, like a [[Roth 401(k)]], has [[IRA distribution tables|required minimum distributions]].&lt;ref name="irs._Reti"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Retirement Plans FAQs regarding Required Minimum Distributions| publisher = IRS | date = 2017-11-16 | accessdate = 2017-11-24 | url = https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/retirement-plans-faqs-regarding-required-minimum-distributions | quote = The RMD rules apply to all employer sponsored retirement plans, including profit-sharing plans, 401(k) plans, 403(b) plans, and 457(b) plans. The RMD rules also apply to traditional IRAs and IRA-based plans such as SEPs, SARSEPs, and SIMPLE IRAs. The RMD rules also apply to Roth 401(k) accounts. However, the RMD rules do not apply to Roth IRAs while the owner is alive.}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the TSP, "Required minimum distributions apply to both traditional and Roth balances and are paid proportionally from both balances."&lt;ref name="tsp._TSP:"&gt;{{Cite web | title = TSP: Special Withdrawal Considerations | publisher = TSP | accessdate = 2017-11-24 | url = https://www.tsp.gov/PlanParticipation/LoansAndWithdrawals/withdrawals/specialConsiderations.html#rmd}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the many advantages of [[Roth IRA]]s is that they are not subject to RMD. Employer sponsored retirement plans like the Roth TSP and Roth 401(k)s, by contrast, do not enjoy that advantage unless they are rolled over to a Roth IRA. For TSP participants who expect to have significant Roth TSP balances, who would prefer not to withdraw from those balances, and who want to remain in the TSP, the decision to contribute to the Roth TSP should be reconsidered, since they will be required to take RMDs on any Roth balance. Alternatively, a full withdrawal of both Traditional and Roth contributions is possible. Or you could withdraw everything except for the minimum $200,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.tsp.gov/planparticipation/withdrawals/accountOptions.shtml| title=Options after Leaving Federal Service| publisher=TSP.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; putting the Roth TSP amount into a Roth IRA and the Traditional TSP amount into a Traditional IRA, and then transferring the Traditional IRA amount back into the TSP.&lt;ref name="whit_HowT"&gt;{{Cite web | title = How To Get Your Tax-Exempt TSP Money In To A Roth IRA | author = The White Coat Investor| author-link=The White Coat Investor | date = 2013-08-19 | accessdate = 2017-11-24 | url = https://www.whitecoatinvestor.com/how-to-get-your-tax-exempt-tsp-money-in-to-a-roth-ira/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A qualified Roth 401(k) distribution is generally a distribution that is made after a 5-taxable-year period of participation and is either:
*made on or after the date you attain age 59½
*made after your death, or
*attributable to your being disabled.

When you roll over a distribution from a designated Roth account to a Roth IRA, the period that the rolled-over funds were in the designated Roth account '''does not count''' toward the 5-taxable-year period for determining qualified distributions from the Roth IRA. However, if you had contributed to any Roth IRA in a prior year, the 5-taxable-year period for determining qualified distributions from a Roth IRA is measured from the earlier contribution. So, if the earlier contribution was made more than 5 years ago and you are over 59½ a distribution of amounts attributable to a rollover contribution from a designated Roth account would be a qualified distribution from the Roth IRA.

If you take a distribution from your designated Roth account before the end of the 5-taxable-year period, it is a nonqualified distribution. You must include the earnings portion of the nonqualified distribution in gross income. However, the basis (or contributions) portion of the nonqualified distribution is not included in gross income. The basis portion of the distribution is determined by multiplying the amount of the nonqualified distribution by the ratio of designated Roth contributions to the total designated Roth account balance.

For example, if a nonqualified distribution of $5,000 is made from your designated Roth account when the account consists of $9,400 of designated Roth contributions and $600 of earnings, the distribution consists of $4,700 of designated Roth contributions (that are not includible in your gross income) and $300 of earnings (that are includible in your gross income). See [http://www.irs.gov/Retirement-Plans/Retirement-Plans-FAQs-on-Designated-Roth-Accounts#distns FAQ's on Designated Roth Accounts], from the IRS.

[[Thrift Savings Plan]] participants should be aware of IRS rules for eligible employer retirement plans and TSP-specific beneficiary rules in order to optimize their estate planning.

== Beneficiaries ==
[[File:TSPEstatePlanningBP.jpg|thumb|Figure 1. TSP Estate Planning inheritance succession when surviving spouse remains in the TSP as a beneficiary participant. By remaining in the TSP as a beneficiary participant, when the surviving spouse dies, their benefit is paid as taxable income.]]
Much like other retirement accounts, TSP account holders may designate beneficiaries for their account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.tsp.gov/planparticipation/beneficiaries/beneficiaries.shtml| title=TSP Beneficiaries| publisher=TSP}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When a TSP participant dies, a surviving spouse beneficiary can assume the TSP account as a TSP [[TSP_estate_planning#Beneficiary_participants|beneficiary participant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.tsp.gov/planparticipation/beneficiaryparticipants/yourAccount.shtml| title=Your Beneficiary Participant Account| publisher=TSP}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-spouse beneficiaries cannot maintain the TSP account. The death benefit payment will be made directly to the beneficiary or to an [[Inheriting an IRA|inherited IRA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.tsp.gov/PDF/formspubs/tspbk31.pdf| title=Death Benefits: Information for Participants and Beneficiaries| publisher=TSP}} (Located at [https://www.tsp.gov/planparticipation/beneficiaries/beneficiaries.shtml TSP Beneficiaries].)&lt;/ref&gt;

Important terms for account holders and beneficiaries are summarized below:
{|border=1 cellpadding=7
|- style="background:#f0f0f0;"
! Term
! Notes
|-
| TSP Participant
| The actual TSP account holder who is a Federal or armed services employee.
|-
| Direct beneficiary
| Any beneficiaries of a TSP account when the TSP participant dies. These may be primary or contingent beneficiaries.
|-
| Beneficiary participant
| If one of the direct beneficiaries was the TSP participant's spouse, then the spouse may choose to retain the TSP account. Upon doing so, the surviving spouse becomes a TSP holder, but as a beneficiary participant and not as an ordinary TSP participant. Per TSP rules, only a surviving spouse can become a beneficiary participant. As described elsewhere, beneficiary participants do not have as many abilities as ordinary TSP participants.
|-
| Successor beneficiary
| A beneficiary participant can designate beneficiaries for when the beneficiary participant dies. Anyone who inherits a TSP account from a beneficiary participant is a successor beneficiary.
|}

Following are several examples of estate planning scenarios using the terms above:
* Fran is a Federal employee and a '''TSP participant'''
* Harry is Fran's husband. He is not a Federal employee.
* Debra is Harry and Fran's daughter.

Fran dies. Fran's beneficiary designations leave 70% of her TSP balance to Harry and 30% to Debra. Harry and Debra are both '''direct beneficiaries'''. Debra cannot hold a TSP account since she is a not the account holder's spouse, and chooses instead to rollover her death benefit into an inherited IRA. Harry, as the spouse of TSP participant, has several options as illustrated below.

=== Scenario 1 - Beneficiary participant stays in TSP ===
Figure 1 illustrates this scenario.

Harry keeps the TSP as a '''beneficiary participant''', and designates Debra as his primary beneficiary of his beneficiary TSP account.

Harry dies and Debra, as Harry's primary beneficiary, becomes a '''successor beneficiary'''. The TSP issues a taxable distribution to Debra.

If Harry's goal was to maximize the value of his daughter's inheritance, then this strategy is flawed because Debra must report her benefit as a taxable distribution.

=== Scenario 2 - Beneficiary participant rolls over TSP into inherited IRA ===
[[File:TSPEstatePlanningIIRA.jpg|thumb|Figure 2. TSP Estate Planning inheritance succession when surviving spouse rolls over TSP beneficiary participant account to inherited IRA. This scenario contrasts with the scenario in Figure 1, in which the surviving spouse rolls stays in the TSP as a beneficiary participant.]]

Instead of staying in the TSP as a beneficiary participant after Fran dies, Harry instead chooses to roll over the TSP funds into his IRA. Since Harry was Fran's spouse, he can transfer Fran's TSP into his own IRA instead of being required to set up an inherited IRA. At this point, the original TSP account is permanently closed.

Harry sets Debra as the beneficiary of his IRA. Upon Harry's death, Debra can establish an inherited IRA from her father's IRA, thereby preserving the tax-advantaged state of the funds.

If Harry's goal was to maximize Debra's inheritance, then this is the ideal strategy. See Figure 2 for an illustration of this scenario.

=== Scenario 3 - Beneficiary participant stays in TSP and bequeaths to charity ===

Similar to Scenario #1, Harry stays in the TSP as a '''beneficiary participant''' and chooses a charitable organization as his TSP beneficiary. Upon his death, the charitable organization will inherit his TSP as a distribution. Since this kind of distribution is generally tax-free to the receiving charitable organization, this is a good strategy if the goal is to benefit a charity.

If, however, Harry is leaving other taxable assets to heirs, then Harry could arguably arrange his estate in a better way to maximize the post-tax value to his heirs; for example, leave taxable assets to the charity (who likely will not need to pay the taxes) and leave tax-advantaged assets like an IRA (created from the TSP he inherited from Fran) to individual heirs who would have paid taxes on taxable assets.

== Beneficiary participants ==

A '''beneficiary participant''' is a spouse who inherited a TSP participant's account.

Although in most respects a beneficiary participant is just like an ordinary TSP participant, a beneficiary participant has certain important restrictions compared to ordinary TSP participants.

=== Rollovers and transfers ===
Beneficiary participants cannot do [[TSP transfers and rollovers]] into the TSP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.tsp.gov/PDF/formspubs/tspbk33.pdf| title=Your TSP Account: A Guide for Beneficiary Participants| publisher=TSP}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Successor beneficiaries of direct beneficiary ===
{{Quote
|title=Successor Beneficiaries of TSP Beneficiary Participants
|quote=“&lt;nowiki&gt;[T]&lt;/nowiki&gt;here is a very important tax planning issue to keep in mind about a beneficiary participant account. When the beneficiary spouse dies, his/her &lt;nowiki&gt;[successor]&lt;/nowiki&gt; beneficiaries may not transfer or roll over the money to an IRA. The money left in the account must be paid to the successor beneficiary(ies) as a single payment and may not be transferred or rolled over to an IRA. This could create a tax burden on the beneficiaries of the spousal account. (This is not a TSP rule, but an outcome required by the Internal Revenue Code.)”
|source=Kim Weaver, director of external affairs for the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board, Sept. 25, 2014.&lt;ref name="fede_Whyi"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Why it's important to check your TSP account before you really check out! | author = Mike Causey | publisher = FederalNewsRadio.com | date = September 25, 2014 | accessdate = March 2, 2017 | url = https://federalnewsradio.com/federal-report/2014/09/why-its-important-to-check-your-tsp-account-before-you-really-check-out/}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
As an eligible retirement plan, the TSP (like 401(k), 403(b) and 457 plans) must observe IRS rules regarding successor beneficiaries of direct beneficiaries. As described in [[401(k)#Successor_beneficiaries|401(k) successor beneficiaries]], successor beneficiaries may not rollover an inherited account to an inherited IRA.

According to the TSP:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.tsp.gov/PDF/formspubs/tspbk31.pdf| title=Death Benefits: Information for Participants and Beneficiaries| p=11| publisher=TSP}} (Located at [https://www.tsp.gov/planparticipation/beneficiaries/beneficiaries.shtml TSP Beneficiaries].)&lt;/ref&gt;
{{blockquote|If a beneficiary participant dies, the new beneficiary(ies) &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;successor beneficiaries&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; cannot continue to maintain the account in the TSP. Also, the death benefit payment cannot be transferred or rolled over into any type of IRA or plan.}}

The inability of a successor beneficiary of a TSP to create an [[Inheriting an IRA|inherited IRA]] with their death benefit portion of a TSP is a significant consideration with estate planning, as it could leave the successor beneficiary with a large taxable distribution. Therefore, spousal survivors who inherit their deceased spouse's TSP may wish to consider rolling the TSP into an IRA if they wish to preserve the tax-advantaged status of these assets for their own beneficiaries; see Figure 2 on this page illustrating this scenario.&lt;ref&gt;{{Forum link|t=147599|title=TSP Beneficiary Account and Tax Burden to Successors|date=25 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Forum link|t=148054|title= TSP - CNN Money: Fed Workers... low cost retirement plans|date=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''non-deductible traditional IRA''' results whenever contributions to a [[Traditional IRA|traditional IRA]] (tIRA) are not deducted on the taxpayer's tax return. It is not a separate type of account; rather, it is a ''feature'' of a traditional IRA that contributions can be deducted from income (subject to income limitations) or not deducted, at the option of the investor. Non-deductible and deductible traditional IRA contributions, and [[Roth IRA]] contributions, share the same annual limit of $7,500 per year, or $8,600 per year for those 50 and over (as of 2026). 

Due to the availability of the [[Backdoor Roth IRA]], appropriate situations for non-deductible traditional IRA investments are very limited. This page focuses on the cases when this account may be appropriate for longer-term investments, and the performance of those investments compared to a taxable account. The basic mechanics of making non-deductible investments and tracking the basis are covered on the [[Traditional IRA|traditional IRA]] page, and the details of using a non-deductible traditional IRA to make a Backdoor Roth IRA contribution are covered on [[Backdoor Roth IRA|that page]].

==Comparisons with other accounts==

The following table summarizes the differences between the three types of individual IRA investments and a taxable account:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Account/Contribution !! Contributions !! Growth !! Withdrawals
|-
| '''Deductible Traditional IRA''' || Pre-tax (tax-deductible) || Tax-deferred || Fully taxed
|-
| '''Non-Deductible Traditional IRA''' || After-tax || Tax-deferred || Growth is fully taxed; return of basis is tax-free
|-
| '''Roth IRA''' || After-tax || Tax-free || Tax-free
|-
| '''Taxable Account''' || After-tax || Interest, dividends, and distributions are taxed || Capital gains are taxed; return of basis is tax-free
|}

===Roth IRA===

A [[Roth IRA]] will always be as good or better than a non-deductible traditional IRA. In both cases contributions are after-tax, but all future growth and withdrawals from a Roth IRA are tax-free, whereas the withdrawal of growth from a non-deductible traditional IRA is taxable as income. A Roth IRA and traditional IRA share the same annual contribution limit. A Roth IRA has an income limit for contribution, whereas a non-deductible traditional IRA does not. This income limit can be circumvented with the [[Backdoor Roth IRA]].

===Deductible Traditional IRA===

If you are eligible to deduct contributions to a traditional IRA (subject to the [[Traditional_IRA#Contribution_and_income_limits|income limits]]), it is almost always better to do so. Deducting the contributions is effectively an interest-free loan from the government. Only in unusual situations where marginal tax rates are very low today and will be much higher at withdrawal would it make sense to elect not to deduct contributions, but in these situations a Roth IRA should be available and would be a better alternative.

===Taxable account===

A [[Taxable account|taxable account]] has key similarities to a non-deductible traditional IRA: contributions are made after-tax, and upon withdrawal, growth is taxable, whereas basis is returned tax-free. Any yield (interest, dividends, capital gains distributions) from investments within a taxable account are taxable in the year they are earned, whereas a Traditional IRA is fully tax-deferred. However, a taxable account has several important advantages. [[Qualified dividend|Qualified dividends]] and long-term capital gains are taxed at a reduced rate (as low as 0%) compared to ordinary income. Taxable accounts also have no contribution limits and no withdrawal restrictions; a Traditional IRA is a retirement account with a low annual contribution limit, and withdrawals prior to age 59.5 are assessed a 10% penalty, if certain exceptions don’t apply. The following table summarizes the differences between a non-deductible Traditional IRA and a taxable account.

==Appropriate uses==

Non-deductible traditional IRA contributions are the first step in making [[Backdoor Roth IRA]] contributions, and are most commonly used for this strategy.

The availability of the Backdoor Roth IRA usually makes long-term investments in a non-deductible traditional IRA inappropriate. They are appropriate only if ALL the following conditions apply:

# Your income and participation in a retirement plan at work makes you ineligible for [[Traditional_IRA#Contribution_and_income_limits|deductible]] traditional IRA and Roth IRA [https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/plan-participant-employee/retirement-topics-ira-contribution-limits contributions]. 
# You have traditional IRAs, SEP-IRAs, and/or SIMPLE IRAs with a large total pre-tax balance that can’t be disposed of:
## The tax cost for [[Roth_IRA_conversion|converting]] the entire pre-tax amount to Roth, potentially in high tax brackets, is too large to be desirable
## You don’t have a [[401(k)]] or other [[Employer retirement plans overview|employer retirement account]] that will accept a [[Rollover|rollover]] from your traditional IRA (or the fees and investment options from the 401k are too poor for this to be advisable)
## You are unable or unwilling to start a business and open a [[Solo 401(k) plan|Solo 401(k)]] that can accept the traditional IRA as a rollover. See [https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=281551 this thread] in the forum for a discussion of legal requirements for opening a Solo 401(k).&lt;br&gt;A large pre-tax balance may cause more tax than desirable when using the [[Backdoor Roth]] process due to the [[Backdoor_Roth#Cautions|pro-rata rule]].
# You plan on investing in [[Tax-efficient fund placement|tax in-efficient]] investments that would favor a non-deductible traditional IRA over a [[Taxable account|taxable account]]; see [[#Comparison to taxable account|below]]
# You plan on holding the investment for a long enough time (decades) for the difference in performance, compared to a taxable account, to be significant
# The long-term performance advantage outweighs the superior liquidity of a taxable account
# You are confident you will spend the money during your lifetime, as opposed to leaving it as part of your estate

==Performance==

Evaluating the performance of a non-deductible traditional IRA is straightforward; the non-deductible basis stays constant, and the value grows according to the investment's rate of return. Upon withdrawal, the difference between the value and the basis is taxed as ordinary income. Variables are defined as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;t = \text{time}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;V(t) = \text{investment value at time t}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;B = \text{non-deductible basis}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;r = \text{overall rate of return}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;tr_{w} = \text{tax rate on withdrawals}&lt;/math&gt;

For periodic (for example, annual) compounding, the investment value is as follows. When analyzing a periodic compounding investment, make sure the period on the rates of growth matches the compounding period. For example, a monthly compounding investment with an annual rate of return of 8% would have a periodic return of ~0.667% (8% / 12). Time should also have the units of number of compounding periods, for example, number of months. 

&lt;math&gt;V(t) = V(0) \cdot (1 + r)^{t}&lt;/math&gt;

Finally, the after-tax value of the account is:

&lt;math&gt;\text{after-tax value} = V(t) - \left ( V(t) - B \right ) \cdot tr_{w}&lt;/math&gt;

If the cost basis has not been documented using Form 8606, the IRS may claim tax is due on the entire withdrawal.

The examples below show the performance of a non-deductible traditional IRA compared to other types of accounts. The contribution of $6,500 was the annual limit in tax year 2023; the limit has since been raised due to inflation. However, the comparisons are the same for any fixed contribution size.

===Example table===

You want to invest $6,500 of pre-tax earnings in a mutual fund and plan to sell it after 30 years. Your federal marginal tax rate is 24% on ordinary income and 15% on qualified dividends and long-term capital gains. The mutual fund has an expected total return of 9%, with capital appreciation of 7% and a dividend yield of 2%, with the latter 100% qualified. The balances and bases (where appropriate) for a deductible traditional IRA, Roth IRA, non-deductible traditional IRA, and a taxable account are shown in the table below:

===Comparison between non-deductible tIRA and taxable accounts===

The following analysis looks at four investments over a span of up to 40 years in a non-deductible traditional IRA (ND tIRA) and a [[Taxable account|taxable account]]. The investor is assumed to have a [[Marginal tax rate|marginal tax rate]] of 24% for ordinary income and 15% for [[Qualified dividend|qualified dividends]] and long-term capital gains. The investor contributes $6,500 after-tax, and withdraws it anywhere from 1 to 40 years in the future. The investment value after taxes is calculated.

[[File:NDTIRAvsTaxable fullsize.png|400px|thumb|right|Non-Deductible Traditional IRA Advantage versus Taxable Account]]

The following conclusions can be reached by analyzing the performance of a taxable account compared to a non-deductible traditional IRA:

* [[Tax-efficient fund placement|Tax efficient]] investments, such as [[Index fund|passive stock funds]], perform better in a taxable account
* Tax inefficient investments, such as [[Corporate bonds|corporate bonds]] and [[Real estate investment trust|REITs]], perform better in a non-deductible traditional IRA
* The performance advantage for a non-deductible traditional IRA is greater over a longer period of time, and when [[Marginal tax rate|marginal tax rates]] are higher

====Stock fund====

* Total Return: 9%
* Yield: 2%
* Qualified Yield: 90%

==Cost basis==
Any non-deductible contribution to your traditional IRA creates a ''cost basis''.{{#tag:ref| {{cite web |url=https://www.irs.gov/publications/p590a#en_US_2020_publink1000230507 |title= Publication 590-A (2020), Contributions to Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs) |date= March 5, 2021  |publisher= Internal Revenue Service |website= IRS.gov|access-date= July 21, 2021}}|name="590A"}}

Your cost basis is the sum of the nondeductible contributions to your IRA minus any withdrawals or distributions of nondeductible contributions.&lt;ref name="590A" /&gt;{{#tag:ref | This a different definition than the [[cost basis methods]] used for capital gains taxes.| group= "note"}}

To designate contributions as nondeductible, you must file [https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-8606 IRS Form 8606] to document the cost basis that should not be taxed at withdrawal. You must file Form 8606 to report nondeductible contributions even if you don’t have to file a tax return for the year.&lt;ref name="590A" /&gt;

'''Failure to report nondeductible contributions.''' If you don’t report nondeductible contributions, all of the contributions to your traditional IRA will be treated like deductible contributions when withdrawn. All distributions from your IRA will be taxed unless you can show, with satisfactory evidence, that nondeductible contributions were made.&lt;ref name="590A" /&gt;

'''Penalty for overstatement.''' If you overstate the amount of nondeductible contributions on your Form 8606 for any tax year, you must pay a penalty of $100 for each overstatement, unless it was due to reasonable cause.&lt;ref name="590A" /&gt;

'''Penalty for failure to file Form 8606.''' Although IRS forms and publications say "you will have to pay a $50 penalty if you don’t file a required Form 8606, unless you can prove that the failure was due to reasonable cause,"&lt;ref name="590A" /&gt; experience has shown that penalty is (almost?) never assessed if you simply send the IRS any such forms you neglected to file. Send them to the same address you would use for paper-filing form 1040.  If the unfiled 8606s do not change the tax owed or refund (e.g., if they merely document a non-deductible contribution), there is no need to file an amended return for those years.  

'''Tax on earnings on nondeductible contributions.''' As long as contributions are within the contribution limits, none of the earnings or gains on contributions (deductible or nondeductible) will be taxed until they are distributed.&lt;ref name="590A" /&gt;

{{for|additional information|wikipedia:Roth IRA}}

A '''Roth IRA''' is a personal savings plan, a type of [[IRA|Individual Retirement Arrangement (IRA)]], which allows you to set aside money for retirement while offering you tax advantages. In simple terms, a Roth IRA allows you to make contributions for which you get no up-front tax deduction, but once money is in the account, it grows tax-free and is also tax-free when you withdraw it (subject to a few restrictions described below). Compared to other retirement accounts, the Roth IRA offers unusual flexibility, in that contributions can ''always'' be withdrawn tax- and penalty-free, and like all Roth accounts, the Roth IRA has no [[Required Minimum Distribution|Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs)]]. Like all IRAs, Roth IRAs are individual accounts and cannot be jointly owned. 

The Roth IRA stands in contrast to the [[traditional IRA]], where contributions may be tax-deductible (subject to income limits) and growth is tax-deferred, but withdrawals are taxable. Roth and traditional IRAs share the same annual contribution limit, currently $7,000 (or $8,000 for those age 50+). The choice of whether to contribute to a [[Traditional versus Roth|traditional or Roth]] accounts can be a complex tax-planning decision.

Named after US Senator William Roth, Roth IRAs were established by the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Taxpayer Relief Act Of 1997--Conference Report|url=https://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/7/31/senate-section/article/S8415-1|accessdate=Sep 17, 2009|date=July 31, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages==

*Roth IRAs offer life-long tax-free growth on invested money. Compared to a [[Taxable account|taxable]] brokerage account where you pay tax on interest, dividends, and capital gains, a Roth IRA can offer significant tax savings, increasing the amount of money available to spend in retirement.
*Contributions can be withdrawn at any time tax- and penalty-free, a unique feature among retirement accounts which adds great flexibility. A Roth IRA can even be used to hold an [[Roth IRA as an emergency fund|emergency fund]]. 
*The tax-free structure gives you valuable space to hold [[Tax-efficient fund placement|tax-inefficient investments]], and lets you buy and sell investments for [[rebalancing]] or changing your portfolio without incurring capital gains tax.
*It is easy to find Roth IRAs with a wide selection of great investment and very low fees. 
*Unlike [[Employer retirement plans overview|employer retirement plans]] (like a [[401(k)]]), an IRA is under your complete control; an employer can't change the plan rules or investments, or add fees. 
*Although there are [[#Contribution_eligibility_and_limits|income limits]] for direct contributions, in most cases these limits can be circumvented with the [[Backdoor Roth IRA]] process.
*The contribution limit is separate from any employer plans; you can contribute up to the maximum to both accounts. The Roth IRA pairs well with a traditional employer plan, offering extra tax-advantaged space and [[Traditional_versus_Roth#Tax_diversification|tax diversification]] to mid/high-earners.
*Contributions are eligible for the [[Saver's credit]] for lower-income investors.
*Like all Roth accounts, Roth IRAs have no [[Required Minimum Distribution|Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs)]]
*Money in a Roth IRA gets more [[asset protection]] than a brokerage account; some or all of the value may be protected from creditors or bankruptcy, depending on the laws in your state.
*[[Estate planning]] benefits - money can be left to heirs easily via designated beneficiaries (avoiding [[probate]]), and non-spouse heirs generally get an additional [[Stretch IRA|ten years]] of tax-free growth before they have to empty the account.

==Disadvantages==

*Earnings on investments cannot be withdrawn before age 59½ without paying taxes and penalties, although the penalty can be waived if any of certain exceptions apply.
*Many investors in their peak earnings year should probably prefer [[Traditional versus Roth|traditional investments to Roth]], meaning they should contribute to a [[traditional IRA]] (if their income allows those contributions to be deducted) and/or a traditional employer plan (if the investments and fees are good) before a Roth IRA.
*Compared to an ERISA-governed employer plan, which gets excellent [[asset protection]] at the federal level, the Roth IRA only gets state-level protection, which may be much worse. Even if you live in a state with good asset protection for a Roth IRA, there is a chance you may later move.
*For high-earners, contributing through the [[Backdoor Roth IRA]] process adds some extra complexity and opportunities for mistakes. Backdoor Roth IRA mistakes are a common question on the [https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/index.php Bogleheads forum].

==Traditional versus Roth==
{{main|Traditional versus Roth}}

There are two basic types of IRAs, [[Traditional_IRA|traditional]] and Roth. The table below reviews some of the differences between the two account structures.

* Penalty free withdrawals can begin at age 59½ and are mandatory by age 73, increasing to age 75 for those born in 1960 or later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=26 U.S. Code § 401(a)(9)(C)(v) - Qualified pension, profit-sharing, and stock bonus plans|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/401#a_9_C_v|accessdate=August 29, 2025|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt; You can also make penalty free withdrawals with a defined series of [[Substantially equal periodic payments]] from an IRA.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Taxes are paid on earnings when withdrawn from the IRA.
* Withdrawals before age 59½ are subject to a 10% penalty (subject to exceptions).
* Contributions made to a Traditional IRA qualify for the Retirement Savings Contributions Credit ([[Saver's credit|Saver's Credit]]) if you meet the filing and income requirements.&lt;ref name="pub571"&gt; {{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/publications/p571/ch10.html| title=Retirement Savings Contributions Credit (Saver's Credit), Publication 571| publisher=IRS| accessdate=August 29, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

|&lt;!--- 2nd column ---&gt;
* Contributions may be made only by those having compensation and making under a certain income; anyone can [[#Conversion to Roth IRA|convert]] a Traditional IRA to a Roth. Contributions are not tax-deductible.
* Principal contributions (but not earnings) can be withdrawn at any time without penalty (subject to some minimal conditions).
* After age 59½, all earnings and principal are tax free (subject to some minimal conditions).
* There is no mandatory distribution age for the account owner, or in the case of a spousal rollover.
* Contributions made to a Roth IRA qualify for the Retirement Savings Contributions Credit ([[Saver's credit|Saver's Credit]]) if you meet the filing and income requirements.&lt;ref name="pub571" /&gt; 
|}

As a general rule of thumb, the decision as to which IRA an investor elects to use is a function of expected present and future tax rates. Thus a traditional IRA should be considered if the present [[marginal tax rate]] is expected to be higher than the future marginal rate at distribution; The Roth IRA should be considered if the present marginal tax rate is expected to be lower than the future marginal rate at distribution. If the outlook for tax rates is uncertain, you should consider diversifying contributions (or conversions) between the two account types. A Roth IRA may also be a strong candidate for consideration if the account is used as an estate planning tool. For the original account owner (and spousal inheritors) there are no required minimum distributions to deplete the account for subsequent beneficiaries. If you face estate tax a Roth conversion can produce tax savings to the estate since the income tax paid on the conversion both reduces the estate and renders tax savings since the income tax rate is lower than the estate tax rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author1=Maria A. Bruno| author2=Colleen M. Jaconetti| url=https://vanguard.com/pdf/s619.pdf| title=The IRA opportunity: To Roth or not to Roth?| publisher=Vanguard Research| date=May 2011| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190909145644/https://vanguard.com/pdf/s619.pdf| archive-date=September 9, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike traditional [[Employer retirement plans overview|employer retirement plans]] which have no income limits for contribution, the relatively low [[Traditional_IRA#Contribution_and_income_limits|income limits]] for the traditional IRA diminishes its utility for most high- and even mid-income earners. If you are phased out of deducting traditional IRA contributions, contributing to a Roth IRA is almost always better the alternative, making [[Non-deductible traditional IRA|non-deductible]] contributions to a traditional IRA. The Roth IRA has income limits too (see below), but in most cases they can be circumvented via the [[Backdoor Roth IRA]] process.

==Contribution eligibility and limits==

As of 2025, the annual combined contribution limit for all traditional and Roth IRAs is '''$7,500''', or '''$8,600''' if you are age 50 or older. This limit is separate from any employer plans, including a [[401(k)]], [[403(b)]], [[SEP|SEP-IRA]], and [[SIMPLE IRA]]. The table below shows historical maximum annual Roth contribution limits.

Your ability to contribute to a Roth IRA is limited depending on your filing status and the level of your "modified adjusted gross income". These income limits change year to year due to inflation adjustment. You can find these income limits in [https://www.irs.gov/publications/p590a/ch02.html IRS Publication 590-A: Roth IRAs] Your modified AGI for Roth IRA purposes is your adjusted gross income (AGI) as shown on your tax return modified as follows;

{| class="wikitable"

:*Conversion income. This is any income resulting from the conversion of an IRA (other than a Roth IRA) to a Roth IRA. 
:*Minimum required distributions from IRAs (for conversions only).
|-
|2. Add the following deductions and exclusions:
:*Traditional IRA deduction,
:*Student loan interest deduction,
:*Tuition and fees deduction,
:*Domestic production activities deduction,

Income limits for Roth IRA contributions are shown below. Contributions limits are reduced linearly within the phase-out range.

|-
| Married Filing Separately and living with spouse || $0 || $10,000
|}

Most investors are able to circumvent these income limits via the [[Backdoor Roth IRA]] process.   This process entails (1) making a non-deducted contribution to a traditional IRA, and (2) shortly thereafter, [[Roth conversion|converting]] that money to a Roth IRA. These two steps have the same net effect as a direct Roth IRA contribution, but neither has an income limit.

IRA contributions are also limited by the amount of your compensation. Compensation includes wages, salaries, commissions, self-employment income, taxable alimony and separate maintenance, nontaxable combat pay, taxable non-tuition fellowship and stipend payments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Publication 590-A (2021), Contributions to Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs)|url=https://www.irs.gov/publications/p590a|access-date=February 19, 2022|website=Internal Revenue Service|series="Who Can Open a Traditional IRA?" and Table 1-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The total amount you can contribute to your IRAs cannot be greater than the amount of your compensation for the year of the contribution. For married couples filing jointly, the compensation of either spouse can be used to make the contributions to each person’s IRAs. It makes no difference which spouse has the compensation, but the total compensation cannot be less than the total of the IRA contributions for both individuals.

If you are working for someone else, compensation will be reported in Box 1 of your W-2. If you are working for a business you own, your compensation is the net income reported on the Schedule C less 50% of the self-employment taxes you pay. Other types of income do not fit the definition of compensation and cannot be used for Roth IRA contributions (except for commissions and taxable alimony and separate maintenance). 

===Roth IRA for children===
{{Main article|Accounts for children}}

Parents sometimes wonder if it is okay to contribute to a Roth IRA for their children. As stated above, it is necessary to have compensation in order to contribute to an IRA (Traditional or Roth). Children can obtain compensation by working for a business, as a household employee (for example, babysitting, mowing lawns, etc), or through self-employment. Very young children have few options for legitimate work, but can perform acting or modeling. There are advantages for parents with businesses to hire their children in appropriate jobs, but need to be careful to avoid paying children for household chores through their business. Parents should be aware that a child who has self-employment income over $400 must pay self-employment taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-utl/OC-Whateverystudentshouldknowaboutsummerjobsandtaxes.pdf| title=What every student should know about summer jobs and taxes| publisher=IRS| accessdate=May 26, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, for many jobs that children may have, they would be classified as household employees, rather than self-employed, and would not be subject to employment taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p926.pdf| title=Household Employer's Tax Guide| publisher=IRS| accessdate=December 11, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; While there are proponents for parents paying their children for household chores and using that compensation as the basis for Roth IRA contributions, others, including the Tax Court, take a dim view of considering parents and children in an employer/employee relationship regarding household chores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://fairmark.com/retirement/roth-accounts/contributions-to-roth-accounts/roth-iras-for-minors/| title=Roth IRAs for Minors| publisher=Fairmark| author=Kaye A.

==Conversion to Roth IRA==
{{Main|Roth conversion}}
{{Notice|Recharacterization of Roth IRA conversions made in 2018 or later are no longer permitted.}}

Roth conversions from a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA require you to pay the tax due (without an early withdrawal penalty) on any previously untaxed Traditional IRA assets converted. In general, conversions work best when you are in a low tax bracket and when the source of funds for paying the tax are available outside of the IRA. If the tax is paid out of the converted assets, the payment may be considered an early distribution and is subject to both income tax and, if you are under age 59½, a 10% early withdrawal penalty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Natalie Choate| title=Life and Death Planning for Retirement Benefits| edition=6th| p=247| isbn=0-9649440-7-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since new conversion rules were implemented in 2010, there have been no income limits or filing status requirements for converting a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA. In 2010 alone, investors were given the option of paying the taxes on the conversion either all in 2010 or in equal amounts in 2011 and 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/publications/p590/ch02.html#en_US_publink1000230961| title=Publication 590 (2009), Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs)| publisher=IRS}}{{dead link}} Applies for any 2010 rollover from an IRA, except from Roth IRA to Roth IRA.&lt;/ref&gt; Investors whose incomes exceed the limits for allowing contributions to a Roth IRA should consider the option of contributing to a [[Non-deductible Traditional IRA]] and executing a [[Backdoor Roth IRA]].

For the tax consequences of taking a distribution of converted assets see [[#Distributions Roth IRA | Distributions]] below.

If you wish to undo a conversion done in 2017 or earlier, you do so by executing an '''[[IRA recharacterization]]'''. Undoing a conversion might result from finding that:
*You are in a higher tax bracket than intended, possibly from increased income near the end of the year.
*You find that you do not have sufficient funds to pay the conversion tax.
*The market value of the converted assets has fallen in price after the conversion and you can save on taxes by recharacterizing the conversion and then, in accordance with IRS restrictions, reconverting the assets at the lower value.

==Distributions==

The amounts you withdraw from a Roth IRA are considered to come out of the account in the following order of categories, each with its own tax consequences:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.kitces.com/blog/understanding-the-two-5-year-rules-for-roth-ira-contributions-and-conversions| title=Understanding The Two 5-Year Rules For Roth IRA Contributions And Conversions| author=Michael Kitces| date=January 1, 2014| accessdate=June 19, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#Regular contributions 
#Taxable portion of first conversion (portion that was taxed at time of conversion)
#Nontaxable portion of first conversion 
#Each subsequent conversion, in chronological order but with conversions aggregated by calendar year, with the taxable portion coming out first for each conversion 
#Earnings (any increase in value occurring inside the Roth IRA)&lt;ref name="Fairmark_Distribution"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.fairmark.com/rothira/distrib.htm| title=Roth IRA Distribution Overview| publisher=Fairmark| author=Kaye A. Thomas| date=February 11, 2018| accessdate=June 19, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=April 5, 2023|title=Publication 590-B (2022), Distributions from Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs)|url=https://www.irs.gov/publications/p590b#en_US_2022_publink100089915|access-date=May 15, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Note that conversions are quantized and aggregated by calendar year. For example, if you did three conversions in a given calendar year, then later take distributions in excess of your contributions, you would first distribute the total taxable amount of those three conversions, then the total nontaxable amount, then move on to subsequent calendar years.

The tax treatment is summarized in the following table, from information supplied by KAWill (Fairmark). A "Qualified" distribution incurs no federal tax or penalty.

===Details===

Details on the categories of assets are as follows:
#Regular contributions can be withdrawn at any time with no tax and no penalty. This category includes your life-long direct contributions, plus any elective deferrals you have rolled in from a designated Roth account.
#Taxable portion of a conversion applies only when the lifetime total of withdrawals from all Roth IRAs exceeds the lifetime total of regular contributions to Roth IRAs plus the lifetime total of earlier conversions.
##If withdrawn before the first day of the fifth year after the year of the conversion: no tax, but will be subject to 10% early withdrawal penalty if you are under age 59½ unless an exception applies.{{#tag:ref|Exceptions to the early withdrawal penalty tax on converted assets include total disability, or death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Natalie Choate| title=Life and Death Planning for Retirement Benefits| edition=6th| page=248| isbn=0-9649440-7-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group="note"}}
##Beginning on the first day of the fifth year after the year of the conversion can be withdrawn at any time with no tax and no penalty. 
##Special rules apply to withdrawals of amounts converted in 2010. 
#Nontaxable portion of any rollover
##Applies only after the taxable portion of the same conversion has been withdrawn.
##Can be withdrawn at any time with no tax and no penalty. 
#Earnings
##Applies only after all amounts other than earnings have been withdrawn.
##If withdrawn before the first day of the fifth year after the year you first established a Roth IRA, taxable as ordinary income; also subject to the 10% early withdrawal penalty if you are under age 59½ unless an exception applies. 
##Beginning on the first day of the fifth year after the year you first established a Roth IRA, can be withdrawn with no tax and no penalty if you are over age 59½ or otherwise meet the requirements for a qualified distribution (death, disability, first-time homeowner). Otherwise, withdrawals of earnings continue to be taxable as ordinary income and, unless an exception applies, subject to the 10% early withdrawal penalty.&lt;ref name="Fairmark_Distribution" /&gt;

===Rollovers from designated Roth accounts===

When you roll in money into a Roth IRA from a designated Roth account (like a [[401(k)#Roth_401(k)|Roth 401(k)]]) and later take a distribution, some special rules apply:&lt;ref&gt;{{forum link| t=460217| title=Roth 401(k) rollover resets 5-year rule}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*When you roll in money consisting of direct Roth contributions (elective deferrals), that amount gets added to the "contributions" bucket, and can therefore be withdrawn anytime tax- and penalty-free. This amount gets reported to you in Box 5 of the [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1099r.pdf Form 1099-R] for the rollover. 
**Any earnings you roll in goes into the "earnings" bucket, and comes out last, but possibly subject to taxes and penalties. 
*When you roll money in from an [[After-tax 401(k)]], for example as part of a [[Mega-backdoor Roth]], it behaves the same way as a Roth conversion from an IRA - the taxable (if any) and nontaxable portions come out in chronological order with respect to other conversions. 
*When you roll money in that was previously moved into a designed Roth account via an In-plan Roth Rollover (IRR), that is considered a converted amount on the date of the original IRR, and the taxable and nontaxable (if any) portions come out after earlier converted amounts.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;There is a complication with this rule, as described by forum member Alan S.: "There's an IRS design problem however with respect to distributing the amount from an IRR after rolling to a Roth IRA. The problem is that the IRS 8606 instructions indicate that IRRs be reported on line 22 of Form 8606. If that is done, then the penalty recapture chart (Appendix C in Pub 590 B) produces an incorrect result in favor of the taxpayer who then escapes the recapture tax on Form 5329. The IRS has allowed this disconnect to exist for 14 years now, which illustrates that Appendix C is not on their radar. No telling how tax software addresses this, but it's most likely designed to follow the 8606 Inst. The recommended fix for this problem is to not include IRRs on line 22 of Form 8606 as the instructions indicate. Put them on line 24 instead where Roth conversions go. If you do that then Appendix C will work as clearly intended by the IRS in [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-10-84.pdf Notice 2010-84].&lt;/ref&gt;

When a Roth IRA is ''qualified'' - that is, when the owner is at least 59½ or disabled, and has had a Roth IRA for at least 5 years - all withdrawals are tax- and penalty-free, including any money once rolled in from a designated Roth account (such as a Roth 401k).

===Early distributions===

The table above shows there can be tax consequences to taking distributions from a Roth IRA prior to age 59½ or before the Roth has been held for a minimum of five years for both contributions as well as for each Roth conversion. Furthermore, there may be state-specific rules regarding non-qualified distributions. For example, in New Jersey, non-qualified withdrawals from a Roth IRA are treated as proportional withdrawals of contributions and gains, so tax and penalty would be due on the gain portion.&lt;ref&gt;{{forum link| p=5388305| title=Roth IRA Idea: Burst my bubble}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.state.nj.us/treasury/taxation/pdf/pubs/tgi-ee/git2.pdf| title=IRA Withdrawals| publisher=New Jersey Tax Topic Bulletin GIT-2| accessdate=August 1, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are exceptions to the early withdrawal penalty, such as birth or adoption, disability, disaster recovery, higher education, first-time homebuying, and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/plan-participant-employee/retirement-topics-exceptions-to-tax-on-early-distributions| title=Retirement topics - Exceptions to tax on early distributions| publisher=Internal Revenue Service| accessdate=August 30, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt; Note that while the exceptions can waive the ''penalty'' for early withdrawals, only disability and the first-time home buyer exception also waive the ''tax'' assessed on withdrawing earnings before age 59½, and only if you have had a Roth IRA for at least 5 years.

===Roth 5 year rule summary===

The [https://www.schwab.com/learn/story/what-to-know-about-five-year-rule-roths following article] is a good summary of the various iterations of the 5 year rule, both for personal and designated Roth accounts.

===Inherited Roth IRAs===

While a Roth IRA does not impose [[Required Minimum Distribution|Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs)]] for the original Roth IRA owner, or for a spouse who elects to treat an [[Inheriting a Roth IRA |inherited Roth IRA]] as their own in a spousal rollover, non-spousal inheritors distribution rules vary. Most non-spouse beneficiaries no longer have RMDs, but must distribute the Roth in entirety by the end of the 10th year after death of decedent. Certain exceptions, referred to as Eligible Designated Beneficiaries, are  required to take RMDs of the Roth over their life expectancies.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Minors under 21 are able to use lifetime stretch RMDs until they turn 21, after which no RMDs are required, but then they must liquidate their Roth entirely by the end of the 10th year after their 21st birthday.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{for|additional information|wikipedia:Traditional IRA}}

A '''traditional IRA''' (Individual Retirement Arrangement) is a personal savings plan which allows you to set aside money for retirement, while offering you tax advantages. You may be able to deduct some or all of your contributions to your traditional IRA. Amounts in your IRA, including earnings, generally are not taxed until distributed to you. See [[IRA|the general IRA wiki page]] for information which applies to all types of IRAs, including the traditional IRA.

==Description==

A traditional IRA allows investors to make either deductible (deducted) or non-deductible (not deducted) contributions, at their option. The annual IRA contribution limit of $7,500, or $8,600 for individuals age 50 and over (as of 2026), applies to all deductible and non-deductible traditional IRA contributions and Roth IRA contributions. When you make non-deductible contributions to a traditional IRA, those contributions become after-tax ''basis'' within the account. Deductible contributions and all growth within the account are pre-tax, and therefore taxable as income when withdrawn. The IRS requires all withdrawals (including for Roth conversions) from a traditional IRA to be “pro-rata” between the pre-tax and after-tax portions. For example, if you make a $1,000 withdrawal from a traditional IRA with a balance of $10,000 and a basis of $6,000, the withdrawal will be 60% ($6,000 / $10,000) non-taxable basis and 40% pre-tax. Therefore, the basis would decrease by $600 to $5,400, and $400 of the withdrawal would be considered taxable income. A fully deductible traditional IRA is a special case of a traditional IRA with a basis of 0.  

Growth within a traditional IRA (for example, interest, dividends, and capital gains) is not taxable in the year it is earned. Rather, taxes on growth are fully deferred until withdrawal. This makes a traditional IRA (along with a Roth IRA and [[Employer_retirement_plans_overview|workplace retirement plans]]) a good place to hold [[Tax-efficient fund placement|tax-inefficient investments]] and to perform [[rebalancing]] trades that sell appreciated investments.

Losses from a traditional IRA – when you make a withdrawal when the balance is less than the basis – are ''not'' tax-deductible, unlike with a [[Taxable account|taxable account]]. 

===Contribution and income limits===

The maximum contribution limit for 2025 is $7,000, or $8,000 for those 50 and older; for 2026, it is '''$7,500''', or '''$8,600''' for those age 50 or older.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/401k-limit-increases-to-24500-for-2026-ira-limit-increases-to-7500| title=401(k) limit increases to $24,500 for 2026, IRA limit increases to $7,500| publisher=IRS| accessdate=27 November 2025}}{&lt;/ref&gt;  You cannot contribute more than your compensation for the year. Compensation includes wages, salaries, etc., commissions, self-employment income, taxable alimony and separate maintenance, nontaxable combat pay, taxable non-tuition fellowship and stipend payments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Publication 590-A (2021), Contributions to Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs)|url=https://www.irs.gov/publications/p590a|access-date=February 19, 2022|website=Internal Revenue Service|series="Who Can Open a Traditional IRA?" and Table 1-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Married spouses can also contribute to their own IRAs, even if they did not earn any income. The total contribution for both spouses cannot be greater than the total joint compensation.

Prior to the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SECURE_Act_of_2019 SECURE Act of 2019], traditional IRA owners could not make contributions after age 70½ regardless of whether they had compensation, but this bill removed that restriction. There is now no age limit to contribute to a traditional IRA.

Deduction of contributions to a traditional IRA is subject to limitations according to your [[Traditional IRA#Contribution_Eligibility_and_Limits|Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI)]]:

If you fall inside the phase-out range, the deduction limit is scaled linearly form 100% to 0. For example, a single filer under age 50 with a MAGI of $82,000 would be able deduct up to '''$6,750''' (=$7,500 * ($82,000 - $81,000) / ($91,000 - $81,000) ) of traditional IRA contributions.

For the purposes of traditional IRA contribution deductions, Modified Adjusted Gross Income is defined as Adjusted Gross Income with the following modifications:

{| class="wikitable"
|+ Modified AGI 
|-
|1.Subtract the following:
:*Conversion income. This is any income resulting from the conversion of an IRA (other than a Roth IRA) to a Roth IRA.         
:*Minimum required distributions from IRAs (for conversions only).

|2. Add the following deductions and exclusions:
:*Traditional IRA deduction,
:*Student loan interest deduction,
:*Tuition and fees deduction,
:*Domestic production activities deduction,
:*Foreign earned income exclusion,
:*Foreign housing exclusion or deduction,
:*Exclusion of qualified bond interest shown on Form 8815, and

|}

===Tracking of basis===
{{See also |Non-deductible traditional IRA#Cost basis |label 1=Non-deductible traditional IRA § Cost basis}}

Financial institutions that hold traditional IRAs do not track the basis. When making a traditional IRA contribution, you do not need to tell the financial institution whether the contribution is deductible or non-deductible. In fact, you do not need to decide whether you want contributions to be deductible until you file your taxes for that tax year.

The basis of your traditional IRA is tracked on [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f8606.pdf IRS Form 8606], which you are required to file with your federal income tax every year your basis changes. The basis of a traditional IRA increases whenever you make non-deductible contributions. The basis decreases whenever you make a traditional IRA withdrawal, or Roth conversion, when you have a non-zero basis.

You are not required to file a Form 8606 for years where your traditional IRA basis doesn’t change, even if the basis is non-zero.

[[File:F8606 2018.png|thumb|right|IRS Form 8606, tax year 2018]]

===The "pro-rata" rule===

Stated simply, the "pro-rata" rule means that withdrawals from a traditional IRA are considered to a mix of pre-tax and after-tax funds, in proportion to the relative sizes of the two balances. The pro-rata rule has some unexpected details. The rule is applied to the combined balance of ALL traditional IRAs, [[SEP|SEP-IRAs]], and [[SIMPLE IRA|SIMPLE IRAs]] that an individual owns. For example, if you have a $10,000 traditional IRA with a $10,000 basis (all non-deductible contributions) and a $90,000 SEP-IRA, a $10,000 withdrawal from the traditional IRA, only 10% ($10,000 / ($10,000 + $90,000)) will be withdrawal of basis and 90% will be taxable. Even though the traditional IRA has a balance of $0 and could even be closed, the remaining $9,000 of basis is effectively transferred to the SEP-IRA. 

The pro-rata rule is applied based on the combined balance of all traditional, SIMPLE, and SEP-IRAs as of December 31st of the year in which the withdrawal is made. This gives the taxpayer some flexibility, for example, to roll over a traditional IRA into a 401k later in the year after making a [[Backdoor Roth IRA]] contribution. 

A spouse’s IRA balances are not considered in the pro-rata calculation. Neither is an inherited traditional IRA. If you have an inherited traditional IRA with a non-zero basis, you will need to file a separate Form 8606 for withdrawals from that IRA. If you are the decedent's spouse, you have the option to combine the traditional IRA with your own, in which case the basis and pre-tax balance would transfer to you, and you would continue to file a single Form 8606.

====Exceptions to the “pro-rata” rule====

There are two exceptions when funds withdrawn from a traditional IRA are not subject to the pro-rata rule:

*When a traditional IRA is rolled into a [[401(k)]] or other [[Employer retirement plans overview|qualified plan]], only the pre-tax portion is rolled over. The non-deductible basis remains within the IRA, which could subsequently be converted to a [[Roth IRA]] tax-free.
*When making [[Qualified charitable distributions|Qualified Charitable Distributions (QCDs)]] from a traditional IRA, only the pre-tax portion is removed, keeping the basis intact.

===Backdoor Roth IRA===
{{Main|Backdoor Roth IRA}}

The Backdoor Roth IRA is a process used to indirectly contribute to a [[Roth IRA]] for taxpayers whose Modified Adjusted Gross Income prevents them from contributing to a Roth IRA directly. There are two steps to a Backdoor Roth IRA:

*Non-deductible contribution to a traditional IRA 
*[[Roth IRA conversion|Conversion]] (usually, shortly thereafter) of the entire traditional IRA to a Roth IRA

The net result of these two transactions is the same as a direct contribution to a Roth IRA. Neither of these two steps has any income limitations, and so taxpayers of any income can make Backdoor Roth IRA contributions. Aside from the complexity, there is no real disadvantage to using the Backdoor process. Due to the pro-rata rule, if you have any other traditional IRAs, SEP-IRAs, or SIMPLE IRAs with pre-tax balances, the Backdoor Roth IRA will not work as intended, and will instead be mostly a conversion of pre-tax IRA balance. For those with an income high enough to need the Backdoor Roth IRA, this will result in a significant tax cost. See the [[Backdoor Roth IRA|main article]] for details.

===Non-deductible traditional IRA===
{{Main|Non-deductible traditional IRA}}

A "Non-deductible traditional IRA" or "Nondeductible IRA" not a separate type of account, but rather results when non-deductible (not deducted) contributions are made to a traditional IRA. Generally, the tax benefits of making non-deductible contributions to a traditional IRA are inferior to either a Roth IRA, or deductible contributions to a traditional IRA. Compared to a [[Taxable account|taxable account]], a Non-deductible IRA has better performance for certain types of investments and worse performance for others, combined with low contribution limits and much less liquidity. Due to the availability of the [[Backdoor Roth IRA]], situations where non-deductible contributions in a traditional IRA make sense are limited. See the [[Non-deductible_traditional_IRA|main article]] for a comparison to other types of accounts, and a performance analysis.

==Rollovers and transfers== 
{{main|IRA rollovers and transfers}}
{{401k rollover infobox}}
A significant amount of traditional IRA assets and annual contributions come from the transfer or rollover of employer retirement plan assets. These  transfer/rollovers occur when an employee severs employment from the employer whether voluntarily through job switching or retiring, or through lay-offs or firings. Employees may wish to transfer an employer plan to a traditional IRA in order to consolidate accounts, reduce plan management expense, or to retain the right to transfer the transferred assets to another employer provided plan. Transfers of traditional IRA accounts occur in three manners:

:*''' Direct Trustee-to-Trustee Transfers'''
:*'''Rollovers'''
:*'''Transfers incident to a divorce''' 

IRA rollovers and transfers can become complicated. Refer to [[IRA Rollovers and Transfers]] for detailed consideration of this topic.

==Required Minimum Distributions==
{{main|Required Minimum Distribution}}

Traditional IRAs have Required Minimum Distributions that generally begin the year the account holder reaches age 73. See the [[Required Minimum Distribution|main page]] for a discussion of the details. 

[[Inheriting an IRA|Inherited IRAs]] (traditional and Roth) inherited prior to January 1, 2020 have Required Minimum Distributions calculated by [http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p590b.pdf IRS Publication 590-B Distribution Table I]. Inherited IRAs inherited ''after'' January 1, 2020 have no RMDs, but must be emptied and closed within ten years of being inherited, unless certain exceptions apply.

Early withdrawals are generally amounts distributed from your traditional IRA account before you are age 59 1/2. You must pay a 10% additional tax on the distribution of any assets from your traditional IRA before you are age 59 1/2.

:'''Exceptions to the penalty apply if the early withdrawal is:'''
:* made to a beneficiary or estate on account of the IRA owner's death,
:* made on account of disability,
:* made as part of a series of [[SEPP:Substantially_Equal_Periodic_Payments|substantially equal periodic payments]] over your life or life expectancy,
:* made to pay for a qualified first–time home purchase,
:* not above your qualified higher education expenses,
:* not above certain medical insurance premiums paid while unemployed,
:* not above your unreimbursed medical expenses that are more than a certain percentage of your adjusted gross income, or
:* due to an IRS levy.

===Excess contributions===

Contributing more than the allowed amount in any year to your traditional IRA also subjects you to an additional tax. Any excess contribution not withdrawn by the date your tax return for the year is due (including extensions) is subject to a 6% tax. You must pay the 6% tax each year on excess amounts that remain in your traditional IRA at the end of your tax year. Also, any earnings on the excess contribution must be withdrawn as well,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-regs/td9056.pdf |title= IRS Treasury Decision 9056: Earnings Calculation for Returned or Recharacterized IRA Contributions |last= |first= |date= |website= |publisher=Internal Revenue Service (IRS) |accessdate= May 19, 2023 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are taxed as ordinary income.

One way an investor can take withdrawals from a [[Traditional_IRA|traditional IRA]] before the age of 59 1/2 without triggering the 10% early withdrawal penalty tax is to initiate a program of '''Substantially Equal Periodic Payments (SEPP)'''. These penalty free payments are allowed under the [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/uscode26/usc_sec_26_00000072----000-.html Internal Revenue Code sections 72(t) and 72(q)].

The IRS allows payments to be calculated according to three approved methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Natalie Choate| title=Life and Death Planning for Retirement Benefits| edition=6th| date=2006| isbn=978-0-9649440-7-7| p=462| ref={{SfnRef|Choate|2006}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once started, you must continue the payments for the greater of either five years and a day, or until you reach the age of 59 1/2, the age at which IRA withdrawals can usually avoid the early withdrawal penalty tax.{{sfn|Choate|2006|p=457}} You choose whether the payments from the IRA are monthly, quarterly, or annually.{{sfn|Choate|2006|p=460}} If you fail to maintain payments, or their periodicity, the IRS imposes a 10% penalty tax for early withdrawals on '''all''' prior withdrawals.{{sfn|Choate|2006|p=478}} In addition, once you have started an SEPP program for an IRA, a lump sum withdrawal from the IRA before the tenure requirements have been met (age 59 and 1/2 or five years and a day) will trigger the penalty tax. As a result, if you establish an SEPP at age 57, any lump sum withdrawals from the SEPP IRA before age 62 will trigger the penalty tax, even if it occurs after age 59 and 1/2.{{sfn|Choate|2006|p=477}}

The solution to this problem is to establish a single or multiple SEPP IRA program on a portion of your IRAs, leaving some of your IRAs out of the program. If the IRA custodian does not enter code "2" ("Early distribution, exception applies") on the 1099-R form you will receive each year, you will need to file your SEPP withdrawals on [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f5329.pdf IRS Form 5329] when you prepare your tax return.{{sfn|Choate|2006|p=470-471}}

==Approved withdrawal methods==
The IRS approves three withdrawal methods for SEPPs:

*'''Required minimum distribution method''' - The required minimum distribution method consists of an account balance and a life expectancy factor (single life, or uniform life, or joint life and last survivor, each using the age(s) reached in the year for which distributions are calculated). The annual payment is redetermined for each year. The RMD method produces a variable income distribution as the market value of the IRA portfolio fluctuates and as the life expectancy factor changes. In general, the single life table produces higher income withdrawals than does the joint life or uniform tables.
*'''Fixed amortization method''' - The fixed amortization method consists of an account balance amortized over a specified number of years equal to life expectancy (single life or uniform life or joint life and last survivor) and a rate of interest that is not more than 120 percent of the federal mid-term rate published in [https://www.irs.gov/applicable-federal-rates revenue rulings by the Service]. Once an annual distribution amount is calculated under this fixed method, the same dollar amount must be distributed under this method in subsequent years. In general, the single life table produces higher income withdrawals than does the joint life or uniform tables.
*'''Fixed annuitization method''' - The fixed annuitization method consists of an account balance, an annuity factor, and an annual payment. The age annuity factor is calculated based on the mortality table in [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/rr-02-62.pdf Appendix B of Rev. Rul. 2002-62] and a rate of interest that is not more than 120 percent of the federal mid-term rate published in revenue rulings by the Service. Once an annual distribution amount is calculated under this fixed method, the same dollar amount must be distributed under this method in subsequent years.{{sfn|Choate|2006|p=461-463}}

As a general rule, the fixed amortization and the fixed annuitization methods produce much higher income streams than does the required minimum distribution method. This can lead to you emptying your IRA account more  quickly during bear markets. Rev. Rul. 2002-62 allows an investor using either the amortization or annuitization methods to make a one-time change to the required minimum distribution method, which usually provides for lower payouts. Once elected, you must make all subsequent annual withdrawals under required minimum distributions.{{sfn|Choate|2006|p=475}}

According to Natalie Choate, the author of ''Life and Death Planning for Retirement Benefits, 6th Edition, 2006,'' people wanting greater flexibility and control over the size of RMD income payments, at the cost of greater complexity and risk, will tend to choose the joint life and last survivor table; while people wanting maximum stability of income unaffected by beneficiary changes will choose either the Uniform or Single Life table. She also mentions that the IRS has allowed SEPP participants to annually recalculate the annuitization or amortization method. You can however only do this by applying for a private ruling from the IRS.{{sfn|Choate|2006|p=464}}

==Account balance==
The IRS has some flexibility in fixing the anniversary date for determining the IRA account balance. The balance can be set any time from December 31 of the year prior to creating the program up to the date of the first distribution. Once you have established it, the same valuation date is used, when necessary, for determining withdrawals. The same flexibility for determining the valuation date applies when you elect the one time change of computing method to the RMD calculation.

An important detail to remember is that the anniversary date determines the five year SEPP tenure requirement if you are withdrawing on a schedule that uses this payout period. You cannot make unsanctioned modifications in the SEPP without penalty for five years and one day starting from the anniversary date.{{sfn|Choate|2006|p=468-469}}

==IRA selection for an SEPP program==
You can create an SEPP program on all of your IRAs; on some of your IRAs, leaving the remaining IRAs out of the program; or on a single IRA. Once started, you cannot move funds from outside the SEPP IRA(s) into the SEPP, nor can you take funds, other than the required annual distribution, out of the SEPP. If you are holding multiple funds in the SEPP you can make transfer exchanges between the funds without penalty, and you can also transfer the IRA(s) to another provider without penalty.{{sfn|Choate|2006|p=469-470}}

==Changes considered modification of the program==
The IRS treats the following acts as modification of the SEPP, triggering penalty taxes:
# Stopping the payments;
# Taking extra payment;
# Changing the "period" of periodic payments;
# Additions to the account; transfers into, out of, the account;
# Changing how the payments in the series are determined.{{sfn|Choate|2006|p=477-478}}

==Using an SEPP for charitable donations==
If you are wealthy enough, are under the age of 59 and 1/2, and want to make charitable donations with retirement plan funds, establishing an SEPP program in order to donate IRA funds to a charity is a valid option.{{sfn|Choate|2006|p=389}}

{{401k rollover infobox}}
You can '''rollover and transfer''' amounts from the following plans into an '''IRA''':&lt;ref name="pub590a"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/publications/p590a| title=Publication 590-A, Contributions to Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs)| publisher=IRS| accessdate=August 21, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*A [[traditional IRA|traditional IRA]],
*An employer's [[401(k)|qualified retirement plan]] for its employees,
*A deferred compensation plan of a state or local government ([[457(b)|section 457 plan]])
*A tax-sheltered annuity plan ([[403(b)|section 403 plan]])

==Types of transfers==

===Direct trustee-to-trustee transfers===
You can transfer funds in one traditional IRA from one trustee directly to another, either at your request or at the trustee's request, through a direct trustee-to-trustee transfer. Because there is no distribution of assets to the plan holder, the transfer does not trigger the 10% early withdrawal penalty tax, and is tax free (an amount rolled over tax free from one retirement plan to another is generally includible in income when it is distributed from the second plan). There is no withholding tax imposed on the transfer.

You can make an unlimited number of trustee-to-trustee transfers in a given year. If you want to transfer a qualified plan, your employer's qualified plan must give you the option to have any part of an eligible rollover distribution paid directly to a traditional IRA. The plan is not required to give you this option if your eligible rollover distributions are expected to total less than $200 for the year. When executing trustee-to-trustee transfers you need to carefully monitor the transfer process to make sure that the transaction goes ahead without error.&lt;ref name="pub590a" /&gt;

===Rollovers===
Generally, a rollover is a tax-free distribution to you of cash or other assets from one retirement plan that you contribute to another retirement plan. The contribution to the second retirement plan is called a "rollover contribution". Unlike the direct trustee-to-trustee transfer process which bypasses the individual plan holder, a rollover is executed by distributing a paid out check to the plan holder who must then transfer the proceeds to a new retirement plan account.

Rollovers have the following characteristics:
*You must make the rollover contribution by the 60th day after the day you receive the distribution from your traditional IRA or your employer's plan. The IRS may waive the 60-day requirement where the failure to do so would be unreasonable; for example, you suffered a casualty, disaster, or other event beyond your control. Failing to meet the 60 day requirement results in the distribution becoming taxable, and may also trigger any 10% early withdrawal tax.
*If an eligible rollover distribution is paid directly to you the payer must usually withhold 20% of it. This applies even if you plan to roll over the distribution to a traditional IRA. Exceptions to the withholding requirement include a distribution totaling less than $200; or a distribution consisting solely of employer securities, plus cash of $200 or less in lieu of fractional shares. If you do not want to pay income tax or penalty tax on the 20% withheld for tax, you must use outside funds to make the rollover the full 100%. This would be considered an indirect rollover.
*Conversely, if a distribution is made payable directly to the trustee of the rollover destination account (and actually rolled over), it can be treated as a direct rollover and not be subject to withholding.
*You are limited to only one rollover per one-year period per individual, regardless of how many IRAs you own or their type (traditional, SEP, SIMPLE, Roth). The one-year period begins on the date you receive the IRA distribution, not on the date you roll it over into an IRA. (The once-a-year limit on IRA-to-IRA rollovers does not apply to eligible rollover distributions from an employer plan. You can roll over more than one distribution from the same employer plan within a year.)&lt;ref name="pub590a" /&gt;

Here is an IRS summary of allowable rollover transactions:

|-
||[[File:IRS Rollover Chart.png|800px]]&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Qualified plans include, for example, profit-sharing, 401(k), money purchase and defined benefit plans.&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Only one rollover in any 12-month period.&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Must include in income.&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;Must have separate accounts.&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;Must be an in-plan rollover.&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;Any nontaxable amounts distributed must be rolled over via direct trustee-to-trustee transfer.&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;Applies to rollover contributions after December 18, 2015.
|}

===Transfers incident to a divorce===
If you receive interest in a traditional IRA from your spouse or former spouse to you by a divorce (or separate maintenance decree or a written document related to such a decree), the interest in the IRA, starting from the date of the transfer, is treated as your IRA. The transfer is tax free. There are two commonly-used ways to transfer IRA assets to a spouse or former spouse. These are: 
*'''Changing the name on the IRA.''' If all the assets are to be transferred, you can make the transfer by changing the name on the IRA from your name to the name of your spouse or former spouse. 
*'''Making a direct transfer of IRA assets.''' Here you direct the trustee of the traditional IRA to transfer the affected assets directly to the trustee of a new or existing traditional IRA set up in the name of your spouse or former spouse. 

If your spouse or former spouse is allowed to keep their portion of the IRA assets in your existing IRA, you can direct the trustee to transfer the assets you are permitted to keep directly to a new or existing traditional IRA, set up in your name. The name on the IRA containing your spouse's or former spouse's portion of the assets would then be changed to show their ownership.&lt;ref name="pub590a" /&gt;

===Rollovers/transfers to a Health Savings Account (HSA)===
You can make a once in a lifetime rollover or transfer from an IRA to an[[Health savings account| HSA]] up to the annual HSA funding limit. This is usually not a good idea, because you would lose the ability to contribute and take an HSA tax deduction for the amount you transfer, but it can be an emergency source of funds without paying taxes or penalties. See [https://www.irs.gov/irb/2008-51_IRB IRS Notice 2008-51]. This also may not be a good idea if you live in a state that taxes HSAs. See [[Health savings account#Rollovers/Transfers|HSA rollovers/transfers]] for more details.

==Rollover (conduit) IRA==
A lot of traditional IRAs are the result of employee rollovers from employer plans to individually held IRAs. People rollover plan assets when they change jobs, and often, when they retire. This lets them consolidate retirement assets into a single account, reduce costs, and expand investment options. These accounts are often termed Rollover or Conduit IRAs. 

Before the [[wikipedia:Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001|Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001]], the only way for an employee to transfer assets from one employer plan to another was to establish an uncommingled Conduit IRA. After the passage of the act, you can roll over part or all of the Conduit IRA to a qualified plan, even if you make regular contributions to it or add funds from sources other than your employer's plan.

However, if your retirement account includes qualified-plan balances that accrued before 1974, or if you were born before 1936, you may qualify for special optional tax treatment of lump sum distributions. These options include capital gains and forward averaging tax treatments. You must not commingle contributions or add funds from other sources to the Conduit IRA if you want to preserve these options.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Denise Appleby| url=http://www.investopedia.com/articles/retirement/03/051403.asp| title=Combining Your Plan Assets? Not So Fast!| publisher=Investopedia| date=September 8, 2014| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190117214314/http://www.investopedia.com/articles/retirement/03/051403.asp| archive-date=January 17, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

You can also rollover employer plan assets into a [[Roth IRA]]. This is considered a conversion, and you will be liable for income tax the amount transferred. If you are transferring assets from an employer plan including both regular 401(K) and Roth 401(k) assets, you can rollover to both a [[Traditional IRA]] and a [[Roth IRA]]. If you are rolling over assets from an IRA into an employer provided plan, keep in mind that a qualified plan can accept only pre-tax contributions; any portion of an IRA which has a tax basis cannot be rolled over. You can roll this tax basis portion of the IRA, tax-free, into a Roth IRA.&lt;ref name="pub590a" /&gt; 

If you own company stock in a retirement plan you may be able to take advantage of a special set of rules that allow you to pay only capital gains taxes on a significant portion of the distribution. See [[Net unrealized appreciation]] for fuller details.

Assets held in ERISA plans usually have greater protection from creditors than assets held in an IRA. See [[Asset_protection#Investing_in_an_IRA | Asset protection:Investing in an IRA]] for considerations of asset protection when rolling over assets from an ERISA plan into an IRA. 

== Roth IRA ==
While you can roll over a Roth 401(k) (as well as other equivalent eligible employer plans) into a Roth IRA, it is not possible to do the opposite. From IRS publication 590-A:&lt;ref name="pub590a" /&gt;
{{blockquote|A rollover from a Roth IRA to an employer retirement plan isn’t allowed.}}

Additionally, from IRS retirement plan FAQs:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/retirement-plans-faqs-regarding-iras| title=Retirement plans FAQs regarding IRAs| publisher=IRS| accessdate=August 21, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{blockquote|You can roll over your IRA into a qualified retirement plan (for example, a 401(k) plan), assuming the retirement plan has language allowing it to accept this type of rollover. Roth IRAs can only be rolled over to another Roth IRA.}}

If you are holding your employer's [[stock basics|stock]] in your employer provided  [[Qualified retirement plan|qualified plan]], '''{{PAGENAME}}''' uses a special favorable section of the tax law that allows you to to pay capital gains tax rates on the stock if you are separating from service with your employer, the plan is distributed in a lump sum, and the stock was purchased by your contributions and employer matches.

==Net unrealised appreciation==
The Net unrealised appreciation (NUA) of the stock is not taxed when distributed, and is taxed at capital gains tax rates when sold. Only the taxable cost basis of the stock is recognized as a taxable distribution.

{| class="wikitable" width="100%"
|
&lt;u&gt;Example&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Chris is set to retire from his job with Coca-Cola,Inc. His 401(k) contains $1.1 million dollars of Coca-Cola stock. The 401(k) administrator informs Chris that he has a basis of $300,000 in the stock and $800,000 of NUA. Instead of rolling the 401(k) over into an IRA, Chris elects to take out the stock under the NUA tax rules. The $300,000 basis is deemed a distribution from the 401(k) and is subject to income tax, and if Chris is less than 55, a 10% early withdrawal penalty tax. The $800,000 NUA is not taxed upon distribution. If Chris sells the stock upon distribution, it will be taxed as a long term capital gain. If Chris holds on to the stock, he can defer tax until he sells. Any further realized short term gain on the stock will be taxed as a short term capital gain; any further realized gain held for more than a year is taxed as a long term gain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Natalie Choate| title=Life and Death Planning for Retirement Benefits| edition=6th| date=2006| isbn=978-0-9649440-7-7| pp=138-139| ref={{SfnRef|Choate|2006}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|}

Note that it is the employer or the plan that determines the basis and NUA.

Beneficiaries of a retirement plan can also take advantage of the NUA rules. The IRS considers this to be [[Income in respect of a decedent|income in respect of a decedent]] (IRD). The NUA is taxed at capital gains tax rates when sold, and the beneficiaries get to take a deduction on any estate tax attributable to the NUA.

If the NUA is distributed and held until death, the beneficiaries do not receive step up valuation of the NUA (it still retains its character as NUA and becomes [[Income in respect of a decedent| income in respect of a decedent]] taxed as a long term capital gain). Any appreciation in the stock beyond the NUA does qualify for stepped up valuation.

Qualified plan participants often hold a mixture of company stock and other investments. In this instance, the lump sum distribution would rollover the non NUA assets and not rollover the NUA.

Mary takes a lump sum distribution from her company 401(k) plan. Her $450,000 plan balance includes $80,000 of her employer's stock. The balance of her assets are in mutual funds. Her plan informs her that she has a basis of $30,000 in the stock. Mary rolls over (in a trustee-to-trustee transfer) the $370,000 of mutual fund investments and takes a distribution of the stock. She will pay income tax (and any applicable early withdrawal penalty taxes) on the $30,000 basis. Her $50,000 NUA will be taxed at capital gains tax rates when sold.{{sfn|Choate|2006|pp=143-144}}
|}

When taking a distribution of NUA stock, it is advisable to not commingle the NUA stock with employer stock already held in a taxable account. You should set up a separate account for holding the NUA stock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.investopedia.com/investing/rolling-over-company-stock/| title=Rolling Over Company Stock from a 401(k): When It Does—and Doesn't—Make Sense| publisher=Investopedia| date=January 16, 2023| accessdate=May 14, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The decision as to whether to rollover employer stock or take the NUA distribution is a quantifiable decision. In general, a young employee changing jobs and having a small NUA would likely decide to roll the stock over to a rollover [[IRA rollovers and transfers|IRA]], whereas a 70 year old retiree facing imminent [[Required Minimum Distribution vs annuitization|Required Minimum Distribution]]  would likely take the NUA distribution. Obviously, if the amount of NUA in a plan is large, taking the NUA distribution would be appealing.

The following advanced considerations concerning NUA require the aid of a professional retirement plan specialist:
* Rolling over the employer's basis in the plan and taking distribution of only the NUA.
* Contributing the NUA distribution to a Charitable Remainder Trust (private letter IRS authorization will be necessary.{{sfn|Choate|2006|pp=138-145}}

If you '''inherit an IRA''' (Individual Retirement Arrangement), you are called a beneficiary. A beneficiary can be any person or entity the owner chooses to receive the benefits of the IRA after they die. Beneficiaries of a traditional IRA must include in their gross income any taxable distributions they receive.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Internal Revenue Service|title=Topic no. 451, Individual retirement arrangements (IRAs)|url=https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc451}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

IRAs can be held at a bank or other financial institution or with a mutual fund or life insurance company.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.irs.gov/publications/p590a| title=Publication 590-A (2023), Contributions to Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs)| publisher=Internal Revenue Service| accessdate=April 25, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In almost all cases, it is advantageous to name the primary and contingent beneficiaries you wish to inherit your IRA, as opposed to not naming beneficiaries and having the IRA go through will/estate/probate. 

You can also choose not to inherit the IRA; known as "disclaiming" the assets. This may be useful if you want the benefits to go to someone else, or do not want to pay taxes on the assets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.investopedia.com/articles/retirement/03/041603.asp| title=Disclaiming Inherited Plan Assets| publisher=Investopedia| date=June 14, 2022| accessdate=April 25, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|If you decide to disclaim in full or partial, taking the year of death RMD does not constitute acceptance of the IRA, so you can still take the year of death RMD and then disclaim.

You do not all have to disclaim, or disclaim the same amount, but future equitable accounting may become complicated if any of you diverge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://easysite.commonwealth.com/EasySites/EasySite_T9193Y/_uploads/How%20and%20Why%20to%20Disclaim%20an%20IRA.pdf| title=How and Why to Disclaim an IRA.pdf| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306045952/http://easysite.commonwealth.com/EasySites/EasySite_T9193Y/_uploads/How%20and%20Why%20to%20Disclaim%20an%20IRA.pdf| archive-date=March 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, doing it this way can be complicated. It is simpler to do the disclaimer first, and then for the beneficiaries (determined after the disclaimer) to set up separate inherited IRAs and take the distributions pro rata.&lt;ref&gt;{{forum link| p=2064911| title=Inherited IRA decision}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group="note"}}

==Types of IRA beneficiaries==

The Secure Act modified the RMD rules for certain beneficiaries of inherited IRAs. IRA beneficiaries post Secure Act can now be classified into three categories:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.investopedia.com/not-designated-beneficiary-definition-5025735| title=Not Designated Beneficiaries|publisher=Investopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

1. Eligible Designated Beneficiaries (EDB). There are specific requirements to qualify for EDB status, which entitles the individual beneficiaries to a lifetime stretch, similar to prior to the SECURE act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.morningstar.com/retirement/ed-slott-how-eligible-designated-beneficiaries-changed|title=How Rules on Eligible Designated Beneficiaries Changed for Inherited IRAs| author1=Christine Benz| author2=Ed Slott |publisher=Morningstar|date=May 9, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt; The beneficiaries must be individuals or “see through” trusts in which the trust’s individual beneficiary qualifies as an EDB. 

The following are considered eligible designated beneficiaries and still qualify for a lifetime stretch:

*The owner’s surviving spouse
*The owner’s child who is less than 21 years of age&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://irahelp.com/slottreport/age-majority-and-new-secure-act-regulations/#:~:text=The%20age%20of%20majority%20is,required%20minimum%20distribution%20(RMD).| title=AGE OF MAJORITY AND THE NEW SECURE ACT REGULATION| author1=Andy Ives| author2=Ed Slott | publisher=The Slott Report|date=March 2, 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The child is allowed to stretch IRA payments until they are 21. At that time, the 10-year payout rule will apply, and the now-adult child will have another 10 years to maintain the inherited IRA. &lt;/ref&gt;
*A disabled individual
*A chronically ill individual&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.wealthmanagement.com/estate-planning/special-needs-trusts-can-help-secure-stretch-ira| title=Special Needs Trusts Can Help SECURE a 'Stretch' IRA| author1=Robert Dietz | author2=Jennifer Goode | publisher=Wealth Management|date=April 20, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Any other individual who is not more than 10 years younger than the deceased IRA owner&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.kitces.com/blog/secure-act-stretch-ira-401k-elimination-eligible-designated-beneficiary-retirement-accounts-taxes/| title=The (Partial) Death Of The Stretch IRA: How The SECURE Act Impacts Inherited Retirement Accounts| author=Michael Kitces| date=February 12, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2. Non-Eligible Designated Beneficiaries - this category now must liquidate IRA holdings within a 10 year period (the 10 year rule). Many designated beneficiaries were formerly eligible for a lifetime stretch. These beneficiaries are typically all other individuals who are not EDBs (including “see through” trusts where the individual beneficiary if the trust falls into this category). 

3. Not/Non Designated Beneficiaries - These include beneficiaries that are entities and not persons, such as an estate, a non see through trust and charities. These are subject to different rules, one of which could include distribution from the IRA over a 5 year period.{{#tag:ref|
If the estate remains the IRA beneficiary, the IRA must be distributed according to the following rules:
*If the IRA owner has started taking required minimum distributions, the IRA must be distributed at least as quickly as the decedent's remaining required minimum distributions.
* If the IRA owner is not taking required minimum distributions the IRA must be distributed according to the five-year rule. Under the five-year rule, the assets must be distributed by December 31 of the fifth year since the retirement account owner's death.{{sfn|Choate|2006|pp=89-90}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://www.schwab.com/learn/story/inheriting-ira-understand-your-options

==IRA inherited from your spouse==
{{Quote
|quote = '''&lt;u&gt;Spousal Inheritance of an IRA'''&lt;/u&gt;
You will only be considered to have chosen to treat the IRA as your own if:
* You are the sole beneficiary of the IRA, and
* You have an unlimited right to withdraw amounts from it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Natalie Choate| title=Life and Death Planning for Retirement Benefits| edition=6th| date=2006| isbn=978-0-9649440-7-7| p=169| ref={{SfnRef|Choate|2006}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

You will be considered to have chosen to treat the IRA as your own if:
* Contributions (including rollover contributions) are made to the inherited IRA, or
* You do not take the required minimum distribution for a year as a beneficiary of the IRA.{{sfn|Choate|2006|p=170}}}}
If you inherit a traditional IRA from your spouse, you generally have the following three choices. You can:
:1. Treat it as your own IRA by designating yourself as the account owner.
:2. Treat it as your own by rolling it over into your traditional IRA, or to the extent it is taxable, into a:
:* Qualified employer plan,
:* Qualified employee annuity plan (section 403(a) plan),
:* Tax-sheltered annuity plan (section 403(b) plan),
:* Deferred compensation plan of a state or local government (section 457 plan), or
:3. Treat yourself as the beneficiary rather than treating the IRA as your own.&lt;ref name="590B"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/publications/p590b| title=Publication 590-B (2023), Distributions from Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs)| publisher=IRS| accessdate=April 25, 2024}} (What if You Inherit an IRA?)&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a number of clear advantages to spousal rollovers of an IRA.
*By using a spousal rollover, the surviving spouse can use their own age and Uniform Lifetime Table based life expectancy for starting Required Minimum Distributions from the IRA. Often this can mean a longer period for tax deferral of the IRA.{{#tag:ref|In the first year of ownership, you must take the deceased owner's [[Required Minimum Distribution vs annuitization | RMD]] for that year (to the extent it was not already distributed to the owner before their death).&lt;ref name="590B" /&gt;|group="note"}}
*With a spousal rollover, the surviving spouse can use the IRS Uniform Lifetime Table, which is based upon the combined life expectancy of the owner and someone ten years younger, rather than the typically less favorable Single Life table. The uniform tables provide for a slower payout of required minimum distributions.
*A spousal rollover allows a surviving spouse to name primary and contingent beneficiaries to the IRA. This allows the surviving spouse, if the situation warrants, to correct any problems in the original beneficiary designations. These beneficiaries will follow current IRS rules, typically requiring full distribution within 10 years unless they qualify as Eligible Designated Beneficiaries.
* If the spouse opts to inherit the IRA rather than executing a rollover, the distribution of the IRA will be distributed over the Single Life Table life expectancy of the spouse if the owner died before the RBD (currently 73). If the owner died after the RBD, the spouse uses the longer of their own Single Life Table or the deceased owner's remaining life expectancy."
* As of 2024, final regulations were issued surrounding the Secure Act 2.0, and an additional option was created for spouses. Spouses can choose to inherit the IRA, but instead use the more favorable uniform lifetime RMD table, instead of the less favorable single lifetime table.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.kitces.com/blog/rmd-spousal-election-secure-2-0-secure-act-rmd-rules-spousal-beneficiaries-retirement-account/| title=New RMD Rules For Spousal Beneficiaries Of Retirement Accounts With SECURE 2.0’s “Spousal Election” Option| publisher=Kitces.com| accessdate=October 24, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A spouse might decide to forgo a spousal rollover if they are under the age of 59 1/2 and have a clear need for the income from the IRA. Before the 2024 final regulations, as beneficiary, the surviving spouse was required to take minimum distributions based on the Single Life Table from the account. Withdrawals would be exempt from the 10% early withdrawal penalty tax.{{sfn|Choate|2006|pp=164-165}} After the 2024 updated regulations, the spousal beneficiary can choose use to use the more favorable uniform lifetime table.

If you do not explicitly act to make an election (that is, you do not retitle the account and do not take an RMD as required), it defaults to "treat IRA as your own."

==IRA inherited from someone other than your spouse==
If you inherit a traditional IRA from anyone other than your deceased spouse, you cannot treat the inherited IRA as your own. This means that you cannot make any contributions to the IRA. It also means you cannot roll over any amounts into or out of the inherited IRA. However, you can make a trustee-to-trustee transfer as long as the IRA into which amounts are being moved is set up and maintained in the name of the deceased IRA owner for the benefit of you as beneficiary.&lt;ref name="590B" /&gt;

Like the original owner, you generally will not owe tax on the assets in the IRA until you receive distributions from it. With the passage of the SECURE Act, IRA distributions to a non-spouse must be completed within 10 years following the death of the account owner, unless the beneficiary qualifies as an “eligible designated beneficiary” in which case the beneficiary still qualifies for a lifetime stretch.
As of July 2024, the IRS issued final regulations that confirm RMDS are required for years 1-9 for those IRAs subject to the 10 year rule. However this will be enforced starting in 2025, and RMDS not taken from 2021-2024 will be forgiven (including penalties).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2024-14542.pdf| title=Required Minimum Distributions| publisher=Internal Revenue Service|date=July 17, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.wsj.com/personal-finance/retirement/ira-inheritance-rules-minimum-withdrawals-671b7952?mod=hp_lead_pos11| title=Heirs Finally Get an Answer From IRS About Money in Inherited Retirement Accounts| author= Ashlea Ebeling| publisher=Wall Street Journal|date=July 18, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://www.morningstar.com/financial-advisors/irs-finalizes-rmd-regulations-key-takeaways-10-year-rule-beneficiaries

The proposed year 1-9 RMD regulations do not apply to inherited Roth IRAs, in which case all monies merely have to be distributed by the end of year 10. Executors have until December 31 of the year following the death of the decedent owner to properly title and distribute the IRA to the beneficiaries. Multiple beneficiaries should split the IRA into separate interests so that each beneficiary can:
*Select a fiduciary of choice for investing the inherited IRA;
*Execute their own individual investment plan and account succession.{{sfn|Choate|2006|pp=91-95}}

If an IRA having multiple beneficiaries is not split into separate accounts, the required minimum distribution is based on the life expectancy factor for the oldest beneficiary.{{sfn|Choate|2006|p=90}}

If you establish multiple inherited IRAs you can make tax-free transfers between the inherited IRAs. Although the RMD must be figured on each individual inherited IRA, the RMD can be taken from any of the IRAs.{{sfn|Choate|2006|p=73}}

If you inherit IRAs from more than one individual, you cannot commingle or aggregate the inherited IRAs. Transfers between IRAs and RMD calculations must be made within each group of inherited IRAs.{{sfn|Choate|2006|p=90}}

An inheritor of an IRA can, and should, name primary and contingent beneficiaries to the inherited IRA. The inherited IRA will always retain the required minimum distribution schedule for the original inheritor.{{sfn|Choate|2006|p=95}}

For IRAs inherited by designated beneficiaries and paid out under the 10-year rule, consider tax management when determining the RMD schedule. It is rarely a good idea to wait until the 10th year to withdraw the entire balance, or take RMDs on your own life expectancy for years 1-9.

==IRA inherited by the estate==

If you do not name beneficiaries to the IRA, the IRA will be inherited by your estate and will be distributed to the beneficiaries established by will or intestacy law. An estate executor can still designate an inherited IRA to the beneficiaries, as long as this is completed by December 31 of the year following the decedent's death. Estate executors can use a [http://www.ataxplan.com/bulletinBoard/pdfs/FiducLetterWebVersion.pdf sample letter] to properly execute the transfer of the inherited IRA to beneficiaries.

If the estate remains the IRA beneficiary, the IRA must be distributed according to the following rules:
*If the IRA owner has started taking required minimum distributions, the IRA must be distributed at least as quickly as the decedent's remaining required minimum distributions.
* If the IRA owner is not taking required minimum distributions the IRA must be distributed according to the five-year rule. Under the five-year rule, the assets must be distributed by December 31 of the fifth year since the retirement account owner's death.{{sfn|Choate|2006|pp=89-90}}
* If the IRA left to the estate is directed to the spouse, the spouse may be able to rollover the inherited IRA to her own IRA, in certain cases.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==IRA inherited by a charity==

Because a [[Traditional IRA]] contains a tax liability to the government, it is an attractive account for making a charitable contribution for people wanting to leave charitable bequests. And because a charity pays no income tax on its received gifts, and the testamentary contribution is an Estate Tax deduction, making a full or partial beneficial gift of an IRA balance is often reasonable, especially if the remaining estate is in a taxable account, receiving step-up valuation at death, or is in tax-free [[Roth IRA|Roth IRA accounts]]. It is often a good idea to keep planned charitable IRA contributions in a separate IRA. Using separate IRAs is the safest route as it ensures that individual beneficiaries can use lifetime required minimum distribution of the inherited IRA. A fractional beneficiary designation that includes both individual and charitable beneficiaries can be split by distribution of the charitable interest by September 30 of the year following the death of the IRA owner, or by the establishment of separate accounts by December 31 of the year following the IRA owner's death and allow individual lifetime distribution, but only if the the deadlines are met.{{sfn|Choate|2006|pp=357-359}}

==Advanced beneficiary options==
These beneficiary options require the services of a qualified estate planner.

*Naming a [[Trusts#Inherited IRA trusts|trust as an IRA beneficiary]];{{#tag:ref|Trusts can be named as beneficiaries of IRAs/retirement accounts, but special care is needed to make sure the trust is set up and worded correctly and also that the particular trust beneficiaries meet the applicable criteria, such as being individuals (not entities) and meeting “look through” criteria. Failure to comply with these rules may cause the trust to lose its potential 10 year (non-EDB) or lifetime (EDB) stretch distribution status, and revert to the default 5 year distribution status applicable to most entities (non-individuals). It is advisable to seek out an estate planning attorney who is experienced with setting up trusts that ultimately will hold IRAs and/or other retirement accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://ataxplan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Estate_Planning_for_Retirement_Benefits_post_SECURE_and_Prop_Regs.pdf

*Disclaiming an IRA;

==Deadlines==

Here are key dates you should keep in mind to make sure you meet the IRS deadlines that apply to the options you choose.

* December 31 of the original account owner's year of death. Prior to revised final IRS regulations on July 19, 2024, if the account owner died on or after their required beginning date (RBD), the RMD for the year must be satisfied if it was not taken in full during the account owner's lifetime. The July 2024 regulations extended the deadline to the later of the beneficiary’s year-of-death tax return deadline—generally April 15, including extensions—or December 31 of the year following the year of death. For most beneficiaries it will likely be the latter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Rahn|first=Mike|date=December 19, 2024|title=RMD Regulations’ Year-of-Death Rules Yield Both Answers and Questions|url=https://thelink.ascensus.com/articles/2024/12/18/rmd-regulations-year-of-death-rules-yield-both-answers-and-questions|website=Ascensus}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* December 31 of the year following the original account owner's year of death. If you are taking RMD based on the life-expectancy method, distributions must begin by this date. If you are one of multiple beneficiaries, all beneficiaries must have established separate inherited IRA accounts by this date in order to calculate distributions based upon each beneficiary's own life expectancy.
* September 30 of the year following the original account owner's year of death. Important for determining the beneficiary whose life expectancy may be used to calculate RMD (the designated beneficiary). If you are one of multiple beneficiaries of varying ages, all beneficiaries must use the life expectancy factor of the oldest beneficiary who has not taken a lump-sum distribution or disclaimed their entire interest prior to this date. However, if all of the beneficiaries have established separate IRA accounts by December 31 of the year following the account owner's death, then all beneficiaries may be able to use their own life expectancy factors to calculate their RMD. Check with your tax advisor to see if you are eligible for this benefit.
* October 31 of the year following the account owner's year of death. Important if you are the trustee of a trust named as IRA beneficiary. The IRS mandates that trustees provide the fiduciary with a copy of the trust document or a summary list of the trust's beneficiaries and conditions by this date. If this requirement is not met, or if the trust failed to meet certain other IRS requirements, it is not considered a qualifying trust eligible for more favorable RMD calculations, usually based on the life-expectancy of the oldest trust beneficiary.
* Within nine months after the original account owner's death. If you are planning to disclaim the assets, your written disclaimer generally must be received no later than nine months after the date on which you become entitled to the assets, according to IRS regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://personal.vanguard.com/us/accounttypes/retirement/ATSIRAInheritDeadlinesNSContent.jsp| title=IRA Inheriting Deadlines| publisher=Vanguard}}{{dead link}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Federal estate tax deduction==
{{Quote
|quote = '''&lt;u&gt;Federal Estate Tax on Income in Respect of a Decedent'''.&lt;/u&gt;
"This is becoming an increasingly important deduction as more and more taxpayers inherit money in company retirement plans or traditional IRAs. Such amounts are considered "income in respect of a decedent" because the decedent had a right to the income at the time of death, but the income is not included on the person's final tax return. Instead, the beneficiary is taxed on the amounts. You might also deserve a deduction, though, if the decedent's estate was large enough to pay federal estate taxes. Say, for example, that you inherit a $50,000 IRA which, because it was included in your mother's taxable estate, boosted the estate tax bill by $20,500. Although you have to pay tax as you pull money out of the IRA, you also get a deduction for that $20,500. If you pull the full $50,000 out at once, you'd get the full deduction. If you pull it out equally over two years, you'd deduct $10,250 each year. This miscellaneous deduction is not subject to the 2% limit but it is up to you to know the rules to take advantage of them."

A beneficiary may be able to claim a deduction for estate tax resulting from certain distributions from a traditional IRA. The beneficiary can deduct the estate tax paid on any part of a distribution that is [[Income in respect of a decedent|income in respect of a decedent]] (IRD). They can take the deduction for the tax year the income is reported. The deduction is taken by the beneficiary receiving the IRD, not the beneficiary who pays the estate tax. 

{| class="wikitable"
|
&lt;u&gt;Example&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Jack dies in 2002 with an estate of $3 million. He leaves his $1 million IRA (which is entirely IRD) to his daughters Jill and Holly. He leaves his $2 million probate estate (which is not IRD) to his son Alex. Alex pays the federal estate tax of $897,500. The [section 691(c) IRD] deduction goes equally to Jill and Holly because they received the IRD, even though Alex is the one who paid the estate tax.{{sfn|Choate|2006|p=125}}
|}

Any taxable part of a distribution that is not income in respect of a decedent is a payment the beneficiary must include in income. However, the beneficiary cannot take any estate tax deduction for this part.

A surviving spouse can roll over the distribution to another traditional IRA and avoid including it in income for the year received.

==Inherited IRA with a basis==
When an IRA owner passes with IRA basis documented on [https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-8606 Form 8606], the remaining basis is inherited by the beneficiary in proportion to the beneficiary interests.&lt;ref&gt;From forum member Alan S. Also see: {{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/publications/p590b/| title=Publication 590-B| publisher=IRS}} (IRA with basis)&lt;/ref&gt;

If the beneficiary is a surviving spouse who rolls the IRA over to their own name or defaults to ownership by perhaps missing an RMD, the inherited basis is added to any basis the surviving spouse may have in their own IRA. The surviving spouse would then file their own 8606 which would result in their RMDs or other distributions being partially tax free. 

If the inherited IRA is maintained in inherited form, any basis in the Inherited IRA would have to be kept separate from any basis the surviving spouse has in their own IRA by filing an 8606 for each labeled "owned IRA" or "Inherited IRA". If the surviving spouse does not have any basis in their own IRAs, it could be advantageous to keep the deceased's IRA with a basis in an Inherited IRA and withdraw from that instead of from their own IRA if money is needed before RMDs start in their own IRA. Withdrawing from an Inherited IRA before you turn 59 1/2 will also avoid any early withdrawal penalties.

If you made a contribution to a [[Roth IRA]] or [[Traditional IRA |traditional IRA]], you can switch the type of IRA by using an '''{{PAGENAME}}'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/publications/p590a/|title=Publication 590-A, Contributions to Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs)| publisher=IRS| accessdate=May 14, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt; up to October 15 of the year after you made the original contribution. This treats the contribution as if it was made to the other type of IRA in the first place. This is useful for correcting a contribution that you later discovered you were not allowed to make, or which you put into the wrong kind of IRA.

==Timing of recharacterization==
 
Where you made an excess Roth contribution in one year, for example in 2016, you can recharacterize to a traditional IRA up to October 15, 2017, the six-month extension period for filing 2016 returns. In this case, the contribution to the traditional IRA can be converted to Roth as soon as the day following the recharacterization.

==How to recharacterize==

To recharacterize, notify the custodian of the IRA (Vanguard, for example) which transaction you want to recharacterize. They will adjust the amount recharacterized to account for any earnings or losses on the IRA since the contribution; your custodian computes the earnings for you and transfers the proper amount to the other type of IRA. However, for tax purposes, it is treated as if you contributed the original amount. For example, if you contributed $5,000 to a Roth IRA, the Roth IRA declined in value to $4,000, and you recharacterize the contribution as a Traditional IRA contribution and are eligible for a deduction, you may deduct $5,000 as an IRA contribution for the year.

If you filed your tax return by April 15 of the year following the contribution (or applied for an extension at the time), you may recharacterize until October 15 of that year. If you recharacterize after April 15, write "Filed pursuant to section 301.9100-2" on your amended return. 

The recharacterization may change your taxes for the year of the original contribution, even if you recharacterized in the following year. If you have already filed a tax return for the year of the contribution, you must file an amended return. If you recharacterized a Roth IRA contribution as a deductible IRA contribution, you will receive a refund. If you recharacterized a deductible IRA contribution as a Roth IRA contribution, you will owe extra tax. If you recharacterized a non-deductible IRA to a Roth IRA or vice versa, your tax owed will not change, but you still need to amend the return to correct your IRS [https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-8606 Form 8606]. (In this case, you can mail Form 8606 by itself, because there was no change to the taxes owed.)

Following the [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i8606.pdf instructions for Form 8606], attach a statement to your return explaining any recharacterization.

==How to save taxes by recharacterizing==

===Changing type of IRA contribution===
If you contributed to a deductible IRA and its value rose, you can benefit by recharacterizing rather than converting directly to a Roth. If you contributed to a Roth IRA and its value fell, you can benefit by recharacterizing if you are eligible for a traditional IRA. This is still allowed under the 2018 tax law.

{| class="wikitable" width="100%"
|
&lt;u&gt;Example&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
You contributed $5,000 to a deductible Traditional IRA in March 2019, and expected to reduce your taxes by $1,100 because you were in a 22% tax bracket. In January 2020, with the Traditional IRA now worth $7,000, you decide that a Roth IRA would have been better. If you convert the Traditional IRA to a Roth, you would get an $1,100 tax reduction for 2019 but owe $1,540 on the conversion for 2020. But if you recharacterize the 2019 contribution as a Roth contribution, you save $440 in taxes.
|}

{| class="wikitable" width="100%"
|
&lt;u&gt;Example&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
You contributed $5,000 to a Roth IRA in April 2019 even though you were eligible for a deductible IRA. In October 2020, your Roth has lost 40% of its value. You recharacterize the contribution, then worth $3,000, as a Traditional IRA contribution, filing an amended return, and receive an $1,100 refund because you are in a 22% tax bracket. You wait until January 2021 in order to postpone taxes for another year, then convert the Traditional IRA, which is still worth $3,000, back to a Roth IRA; you will owe $660 in taxes for 2021 on the conversion, saving $440 in taxes.
|}

===Different tax brackets===
If you can undo a taxable contribution and redo it in a year in which you are in a lower tax bracket, you may benefit even if the market does not move. 

{| class="wikitable" width="100%"
|
&lt;u&gt;Example&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
You contributed $5,000 to a Roth in 2018, when you were in the 24% bracket. When doing your taxes in February 2019, you learn that your income was too high to contribute to a Roth. You expect little income in 2019 and decide to pay the taxes at your lower 10% rate instead. Because you did not have access to an employer retirement plan in 2018, you recharacterize the contribution to a traditional IRA and take a deduction on your 2018 tax return, saving $1,200 in taxes. In February 2019, the traditional IRA is worth $5,300 so you then convert it back to the Roth a few days later and pay $530 on the conversion. You saved $670 in taxes.
|}

==Missing the deadline==
The IRS will consider relief for taxpayers who belatedly discover that they are ineligible for making a contribution, especially when these are errors made in good faith, and are reported prior to the IRS uncovering the error (under Reg.301.9100-1).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/26/301.9100-1| title=26 CFR 301.9100-1 - Extensions of time to make elections| publisher=Legal Information Institute, Cornell University Law School}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, both the Congress and the IRS sometimes grant extensions for disaster relief for victims of disasters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Natalie Choate| title=Life and Death Planning for Retirement Benefits| edition=6th| date=2006| isbn=978-0-9649440-7-7| pp=255-256}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If you '''inherit a Roth IRA''', you are called a beneficiary. A beneficiary can be any person or entity the owner chooses to receive the benefits of the IRA after they die. Careful selection of beneficiaries, timely and proper titling of inherited accounts, and awareness of distribution options can maximize the value of an inherited Roth IRA. In almost all cases, it is advantageous to name the primary and contingent beneficiaries you wish to inherit your Roth IRA.

Except for a few situations, inherited Roth IRAs are subject to most of the same rules as [[Inheriting an IRA | inheriting a traditional IRA]]. The main differences for an inherited Roth IRA are:&lt;ref group="note"&gt;See: IRS Publication 590, [https://www.irs.gov/publications/p590b#en_US_2021_publink100089630 Distributions After Owner's Death]{{broken link}} or ([https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p590b.pdf#page=36 PDF])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "AlanS"&gt;Comments in wiki [[Talk:Inheriting a Roth IRA| Discussion tab (Inheriting a Roth IRA)]] by forum member Alan S.&lt;/ref&gt;
#The deceased owner is always treated as dying before their Required Beginning Date, because there is no Required Beginning Date for an owned Roth IRA.
#Taxation rules follow those of owned Roth IRAs in that the 5 year holding period for qualification runs while the owner is alive and continues after his death. The beneficiary therefore needs to know the first year the owner made a Roth contribution.
#The passage of the Secure Act in 2019 changes the RMD rules related to IRAs and 401(k)s. Among other changes, the Secure Act created several types of IRA beneficiaries (see below). In many instances, if the beneficiary does not qualify as an eligible designated beneficiary,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.morningstar.com/retirement/ed-slott-how-eligible-designated-beneficiaries-changed|title=How Rules on Eligible Designated Beneficiaries Changed for Inherited IRAs| author1=Christine Benz| author2=Ed Slott |publisher=Morningstar|date=May 9, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt; the inherited IRA or Roth must be liquidated within 10 years; this is different to the prior lifetime stretch rules. In the case of an inherited traditional IRA, the beneficiary may be subject to RMDs in years 1-9, depending on certain criteria. However, there are no RMDs associated with an inherited Roth subject to the 10 year rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.morningstar.com/retirement/faqs-about-inherited-iras
| title=Be Aware of These New Rules for Inherited IRAs| author=Christine Benz| publisher=Morningstar|date=March 20, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Multiple non-spouse beneficiaries can create separate inherited Roth accounts by the end of the year following the year of death just as for non-Roth inherited IRAs. This will enable them to each use their own life expectancies for RMDs (Required Minimum Distributions), since RMDs are required for Roth beneficiaries, but not for owners.&lt;ref name = "AlanS" /&gt;

==Types of IRA/Roth beneficiaries==

The Secure Act modified the RMD rules for certain beneficiaries of inherited IRAs. IRA beneficiaries post Secure Act can now be classified into three categories:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.investopedia.com/not-designated-beneficiary-definition-5025735| title=Not Designated Beneficiaries|publisher=Investopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

1. Eligible Designated Beneficiaries (EDB). There are specific requirements to qualify for EDB status, which entitles the individual beneficiaries to a lifetime stretch, similar to prior to the SECURE act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.morningstar.com/retirement/ed-slott-how-eligible-designated-beneficiaries-changed|title=How Rules on Eligible Designated Beneficiaries Changed for Inherited IRAs| author1=Christine Benz| author2=Ed Slott |publisher=Morningstar|date=May 9, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt; The beneficiaries must be individuals or “see through” trusts in which the trust’s individual beneficiary qualifies as an EDB. The following are considered eligible designated beneficiaries and still qualify for a lifetime stretch:

*The owner’s surviving spouse
*The owner’s child who is less than 21 years of age&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://irahelp.com/slottreport/age-majority-and-new-secure-act-regulations/#:~:text=The%20age%20of%20majority%20is,required%20minimum%20distribution%20(RMD).| title=AGE OF MAJORITY AND THE NEW SECURE ACT REGULATION| author1=Andy Ives| author2=Ed Slott | publisher=The Slott Report|date=March 2, 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*A disabled individual
*A chronically ill individual&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.wealthmanagement.com/estate-planning/special-needs-trusts-can-help-secure-stretch-ira| title=Special Needs Trusts Can Help SECURE a 'Stretch' IRA| author1=Robert Dietz | author2=Jennifer Goode | publisher=Wealth Management|date=April 20, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Any other individual who is not more than 10 years younger than the deceased IRA owner&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.kitces.com/blog/secure-act-stretch-ira-401k-elimination-eligible-designated-beneficiary-retirement-accounts-taxes/| title=The (Partial) Death Of The Stretch IRA: How The SECURE Act Impacts Inherited Retirement Accounts| author=Michael Kitces| date=February 12, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2. Non-Eligible Designated Beneficiaries - this category now must liquidate IRA holdings within a 10 year period. These beneficiaries are typically all other individuals who are not EDBs (including “see through” trusts where the individual beneficiary if the trust falls into this category ) 

3. Not/Non Designated Beneficiaries - These include beneficiaries that are entities and not persons, such as an estate, a non see through trust and charities. These are typically subject to distribution from the IRA over a 5 year period.{{#tag:ref|
If the estate remains the IRA beneficiary, the IRA must be distributed according to the following rules:
*If the IRA owner has started taking required minimum distributions, the IRA must be distributed at least as quickly as the decedent's remaining required minimum distributions.
* If the IRA owner is not taking required minimum distributions the IRA must be distributed according to the five-year rule. Under the five-year rule, the assets must be distributed by December 31 of the fifth year since the retirement account owner's death.{{sfn|Choate|2006|pp=89-90}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://www.schwab.com/learn/story/inheriting-ira-understand-your-options
| title= Inheriting an IRA? Understand Your Choices | author=Hayden Adams| publisher=Schwab|date=May 1, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt; |group="note"}}

==Spousal beneficiaries==
{{Quote
|quote = '''&lt;u&gt;Spousal Inheritance of an IRA'''&lt;/u&gt;
You will only be considered to have chosen to treat the IRA as your own if:
* You are the sole beneficiary of the IRA, and
* You have an unlimited right to withdraw amounts from it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Natalie Choate| title=Life and Death Planning for Retirement Benefits| edition=6th| date=2006| isbn=978-0-9649440-7-7| p=169| ref={{SfnRef|Choate|2006}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

You will be considered to have chosen to treat the IRA as your own if:
* Contributions (including rollover contributions) are made to the inherited IRA, or
* You do not take the required minimum distribution for a year as a beneficiary of the IRA.{{sfn|Choate|2006|p=170}}}}
If you inherit a Roth IRA from your spouse, you generally have the following three choices. You can:
# Treat it as your own IRA by designating yourself as the account owner.
# Treat it as your own by rolling it over into your Roth IRA.
# Treat yourself as the beneficiary rather than treating the IRA as your own.&lt;ref name="pub590"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p590.pdf| title=IRS Publication 590| publisher=IRS| p=20}}{{dead link}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Treat as your own (spousal rollover)===
There are a number of clear advantages to spousal rollovers of a Roth IRA.
#By using a spousal Roth rollover, the surviving spouse can avoid any requirements to withdraw funds from the account. However, you need to keep in mind that withdrawals of conversions within 5 years and before 59.5 will be subject to the 10% penalty on the taxable portion, and withdrawals of earnings will be subject to both tax and the 10% penalty.&lt;ref name = "AlanS" /&gt;
#A spousal rollover allows a surviving spouse to name primary and contingent beneficiaries to the IRA. This allows the surviving spouse, if the situation warrants, to correct any problems in the original beneficiary designations. Naming beneficiaries for the spousal IRA can provide these beneficiaries with the option of using their own life expectancies for drawing down minimum distributions from the IRA once they inherit it.

If a sole spouse beneficiary opts to maintain the Roth as an inherited Roth, no RMDs are required until the year the deceased spouse would have reached their RMD age. Once that year arrives, if the surviving spouse dies, the named successor beneficiaries will have to continue the RMD schedule of that surviving spouse and will not be able to use their own life expectancies.&lt;ref name = "AlanS" /&gt;

A spouse, however, might decide to forgo a spousal rollover if they are under the age of 59 and 1/2 and have a clear need for the income from the Roth IRA. As beneficiary, the surviving spouse is required to take minimum distributions from the account. Withdrawals of earnings would be exempt from the 10% early withdrawal penalty tax.{{sfn|Choate|2006|pp=164-165}}

===As a spousal beneficiary===

A sole spousal beneficiary will inherit a fully qualified Roth if the owner first contributed at least 5 years before death. The death of the owner replaces the age 59.5 requirement for the Roth to be qualified.&lt;ref name = "AlanS" /&gt;

If the spousal beneficiary already owned their own Roth IRA, rolling the inherited one over will enable the 5 year period to be based on the older of the inherited Roth or their own Roth. The sole spousal beneficiary does not need to start RMDs as a beneficiary until the year the deceased spouse would have reached their RMD age, should they not roll it over to their own Roth IRA.&lt;ref name = "AlanS" /&gt;

Circumstances warranting a spousal beneficiary continuing the inherited Roth status are limited to cases where the Roth has earnings but the surviving spouse is not yet 59.5, and the surviving spouse needs to take a lump sum distribution. In this situation, taking it from the inherited Roth would avoid the 10% penalty on the taxable earnings, while assuming ownership would not.&lt;ref name = "AlanS" /&gt;

==Non-spousal beneficiaries==
Whereas a Roth IRA account owner is, under current regulations, not required to take distributions from a Roth IRA, a non-spousal beneficiary of a Roth IRA is required to make distributions from the account. With the passage of the SECURE Act, IRA distributions to a nonspouse must be completed within 10 years following the death of the account owner. Executors have until December 31 of the year following the death of the decedent owner to properly title and distribute the IRA to the beneficiaries.

If you inherit a Roth IRA from anyone other than your deceased spouse, you cannot treat the inherited IRA as your own. This means that the following actions are not permitted:
# You cannot make any contributions to the inherited Roth IRA.
# You cannot roll over any amounts into or out of the inherited Roth IRA into your own Roth IRA.
# Should you inherit Roth IRAs from more than one individual, the inherited Roth IRAs cannot be commingled or aggregated. Transfers between IRAs and RMD calculations must be made within each group of inherited IRAs.{{sfn|Choate|2006|p=90}} 

However, you can make a trustee-to-trustee transfer to an inherited Roth IRA as long as the IRA into which amounts are being moved is set up and maintained in the name of the deceased IRA owner for the benefit of you as beneficiary.&lt;ref name="pub590" /&gt;

{| class="wikitable" width="100%"
|
&lt;u&gt;Example&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
"Harvey Schmidt (deceased April 10, 2008) Roth IRA, For the Benefit of Thomas Schmidt (beneficiary). SSN xxx-xx-xxxx."
|}

Multiple beneficiaries of a Roth IRA should split the IRA into separate interests so that each beneficiary can:
#Select a fiduciary of choice for investing the inherited IRA;
#Execute their own [[Investment policy statement |individual investment plan]] and account succession.

{| class="wikitable" width="100%"
|
&lt;u&gt;Example&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Jill Scott has inherited a Roth IRA from her father, Thomas Scott, who held his Roth at Merrill Lynch. Jill has executed a trustee-to-trustee transfer of the inherited IRA to Vanguard and has invested the IRA in three Vanguard Funds:

*Vanguard Total Stock Market Index
*Vanguard Total International Index
*Vanguard Short Term Treasury Fund

She can transfer funds tax-free between each of these funds (and any other funds she opens within this inherited IRA).
|}

An inheritor of a Roth IRA can, and should, name primary and contingent beneficiaries to the inherited IRA. 

==Estate as beneficiary or beneficiary not named==
Not naming a beneficiary or naming the estate as beneficiary of a Roth will subject the estate to the 5 year rule [[#Non-spousal beneficiaries | above]] regardless of the age of the owner at death. For a traditional IRA, this is only true if the owner died before the Required Beginning Date.&lt;ref name = "AlanS" /&gt;

If you do not name beneficiaries to the Roth IRA, the Roth IRA will be inherited by the decedent's estate and will be distributed to the beneficiaries established by will or intestacy law. An estate executor can still designate an inherited Roth IRA to the beneficiaries, as long as this is completed by December 31 of the year following the decedent's death. 

:&lt;u&gt;Here is a sample letter&lt;/u&gt; which estate executors can use to properly execute the transfer of the inherited Roth IRA to beneficiaries: [http://www.ataxplan.com/bulletinBoard/pdfs/FiducLetterWebVersion.pdf Fiduciary Letter Transferring Plan Account to Beneficiary]

If the estate remains the Roth IRA beneficiary, the IRA must be distributed according to the five-year rule. Under the five-year rule, the assets must be distributed by December 31 of the fifth year since the retirement account owner's death.{{sfn|Choate|2006|pp=89-90}}

==Advanced beneficiary options==

*Disclaiming a Roth IRA

===Tax factors===
While most distributions from an inherited Roth IRA will be tax free distributions, there are circumstances in which a tax may be assessed.

An inherited IRA by regulation is not subject to the 10 percent early withdrawal penalty tax (excepting Spousal rollovers, discussed later).

However, it is possible for the earnings of an inherited Roth IRA to be subject to tax if withdrawn. This is due to the five year holding requirement for inherited Roth IRAs. In order for earnings to be qualified for tax free distribution, the original account owner must have held the Roth IRA for a minimum of five years. The account can be started by either contributions or conversions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://fairmark.com/retirement/roth-accounts/roth-distributions/inherited-roth-ira/| title=Inherited Roth IRA| publisher=Fairmark| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210420054220/https://fairmark.com/retirement/roth-accounts/roth-distributions/inherited-roth-ira/| archive-date=April 20, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a Roth IRA is established by a conversion that is subsequently [[IRA recharacterization |recharacterized]] the original Roth establishment date is nullified and will be established if and when the recharacterized funds are reinvested into the Roth IRA.{{sfn|Choate|2006|p=233}} The five year threshold is met on January 1 of the anniversary year. The following table provides the five year anniversary threshold for various creation dates.

The [[Roth IRA#Distributions |ordering rules]] for Roth IRA distribution provide options for avoiding this tax on earnings.

{| class="wikitable" width="100%"

&lt;u&gt;Example&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Amanda Parker inherits a Roth IRA from her uncle Charles. The IRA was started in 2012 and has a value of $6500 consisting of $6000 of contributions and $500 of earnings. If Amanda takes immediate distribution of the account she will receive the $6000 of contributions tax free. The $500 of earnings will not be subject to the 10% early withdrawal penalty, but because the Roth IRA fails the five year test, Amanda will have to report the $500 of Roth earnings as a taxable distribution on her tax return. Amanda can escape taxation in this instance by only withdrawing the $6000 of contributions and retaining the $500 earnings in an inherited Roth IRA. She can use the Five Year Rule to delay distribution until the five year holding period is reached. The distribution will then be tax free.
|}

For larger accounts with insufficient tenure (most likely converted accounts) the ordering rules usually mean that distributions will come from contributions or conversions and not from earnings until well after the Roth IRA passes the five year test.

If in any year the distributions from an inherited Roth IRA are less than the required minimum distribution for the year, you may have to pay the '''Tax on excess accumulations (insufficient distributions)''', a 50% excise tax for that year on the amount not distributed as required. The tax on excess accumulations is reported on IRS [https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-5329 Form 5329].&lt;ref name="pub590" /&gt;

Finally, for large estates, a Roth IRA may be subject to the estate tax.

==Roth 401k and Roth 403b accounts==

Beginning in 2006, corporate qualified plans, such as 401k and 403b plans, were able to offer a '''designated Roth account (DRAC)''' within the plan. The distribution rules governing these plans are somewhat different from those governing individual Roth IRAs. Among the differences:
#For 2024 and later years, RMDs are no longer required from designated Roth 401(k) and 403(b) accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/retirement-plan-and-ira-required-minimum-distributions-faqs#:~:text=Designated%20Roth%20accounts%20in%20a,required%20from%20designated%20Roth%20accounts | title= Retirement plan and IRA Required Minimum Distributions FAQs | publisher=Internal Revenue Service}}&lt;/ref&gt; For 2023 and earlier, unlike Roth IRAs, Roth 401(k)s and 403(b)s were subject to RMDs. RMDs began the year when: (1) the owner reached RMD age, or (2) the owner retired from the employer (if the plan permits), whichever is ''later''. However, retiring employees generally had the option to roll over Roth balances into a Roth IRA, which has no RMDs, so RMDs were avoided this way.{{sfn|Choate|2006|p=261}}
#The five year holding period for 401k and 403b Roth IRAs (DRACs) is applied for each particular plan held by the employee.
#Ordering rules for Roth IRA distributions do not apply to DRACs. Any distribution from the account is prorated according to the proportion of account basis and earnings in the account.{{sfn|Choate|2006|p=261}}
#The five year holding period for DRACs does not carryover to a Roth IRA rollover. A rollover to a first time Roth IRA begins the holding period for the rollover. A rollover into an existing Roth IRA will receive the tenure of the existing IRA.{{sfn|Choate|2006|pp=267-269}}

==Qualified distributions==
Once an inherited Roth is qualified (5 years from original contribution), it is fully qualified and [https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-8606 Form 8606] is not required to report distributions. The gross distributions are entered only on line 15a of Form 1040. For non-qualified inherited Roth IRAs, the basis from regular contributions and conversions is prorated according to each beneficiary's percent interest.&lt;ref name = "AlanS" /&gt;

{{See also|Inheriting an IRA|Inheriting a Roth IRA}} 

A '''{{PAGENAME}}''' refers to the financial planning concept of designing an IRA ([[Traditional IRA]] or [[Roth IRA]]) for the maximum, tax efficient distribution of its assets as the account is inherited by succeeding generations. The [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SECURE_Act_of_2019 SECURE Act of 2019] changed the rules for distribution for inherited IRAs. Prior to the SECURE Act, beneficiaries could distribute Inherited IRAs over their life expectancy with annual [[Required Minimum Distribution|Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs)]] according to IRS Distribution Table I, and these were referred to as "Stretch IRAs." Following the SECURE Act, some Inherited IRAs will still maintain the lifetime stretch (eligible designated beneficiaries), some Inherited IRAs have no annual RMDs, but must be completely distributed by the end of the tenth year following the owner's death (10 year rule), and some Inherited IRAs will have RMDs years 1-9 based upon a lifetime stretch schedule, with the balance distributed at the end of 10 years. 

For clarity, IRAs governed by the pre-SECURE Act distribution rules will be referred to as "pre-SECURE Act Stretch IRAs" and IRAs governed by the new ten-year rule will be referred to as "post-SECURE Act Inherited IRAs."

==Pre-SECURE Act stretch IRAs==

IRAs inherited before January 1, 2020 (excluding those inherited by a surviving spouse who elects to treat the IRA as their own) still follow the pre-SECURE Act Stretch IRA rules.  When the designated beneficiary who inherited an IRA prior to 1/1/2020 passes, the ten-year rule will apply to the successor beneficiary, unless one of the exceptions (eligible designated beneficiaries) applies to the successor beneficiary.

Pre-SECURE Act Stretch IRAs have [[Required Minimum Distribution|Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs)]] for the beneficiary that begin the year ''after'' the owner died, regardless of the beneficiary's age. However, the life expectancy for which the RMDs are calculated will be at least several decades for most beneficiaries, so RMDs will initially be small. See the [[Required_Minimum_Distribution#Beneficiaries|RMD page]] for details on this calculation.

Note that for 2020, RMDs are not required due to the COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Julie Jason|date=April 16, 2020|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/juliejason/2020/04/16/why-the-2020-rmd-suspension-is-not-fair-to-all/#77847fb9740a|title=Why The 2020 RMD Suspension Is Not Fair To All|publisher=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Withdrawal strategies===

Roth Stretch IRA withdrawals have no tax consequences, so unless you have an overriding need for the money, the best strategy is to take only RMDs and no more. Traditional Stretch IRA withdrawals are partly or fully taxable, and so can have significant tax consequences, especially with larger balances. While the initial RMD from a Stretch IRA will be small (less than ~4% for those under age 60), RMDs get larger over time, and can get very large when the beneficiary reaches their 90s, resulting in large distributions.  If these future large distribution are expected to cause tax problems, beneficiaries should consider accelerated distributions in earlier years where taxable income is expected to be lower.   

Stretch IRA owners should also consider estate planning tax strategy. If you have health issues or otherwise think you might not live to the final distribution of your Stretch IRA, you should consider what tax structures you would prefer to leave in your estate. Low-tax heirs may prefer to inherit the remainder of your Stretch IRA (which they would then need to distribute according to the SECURE Act's ten-year rule, unless an exception applies), especially if their ten-year window is longer than than the time until you would be required to fully distribute the account. In such a case, it may be advisable to make only minimum distributions. However, if your heirs are high-tax, it may be advisable to take accelerated withdrawals and invest in [[Tax-efficient fund placement|tax-efficient]] assets in a [[Taxable account|taxable account]]. The investments will grow with low tax drag, and your heirs will inherit them with a [[Step-up in basis|step-up in basis]], a significant tax savings.

==SECURE Act inherited IRAs==

IRAs inherited ''on or after'' January 1, 2020 may or may not, subject to subsequent proposed new IRS regulations, have any annual [[Required Minimum Distribution|Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs)]], but for most non spouse beneficiaries, the inherited IRA must be completely distributed by December 31 of the tenth year ''after'' the death of the owner. Beneficiaries may potentially make withdrawals in eleven tax years, if the owner died early enough in the year. The SECURE Act excepts the following beneficiaries, referred to as “eligible designated beneficiaries”,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Christine Benz|author2=Ed Slott|date=May 9, 2024|title=How Rules on Eligible Designated Beneficiaries Changed for Inherited IRAs|url=https://www.morningstar.com/retirement/ed-slott-how-eligible-designated-beneficiaries-changed|publisher=Morningstar}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the new ten-year rule,  in which case the pre-SECURE Act Stretch IRA rules govern:

* Surviving spouses who elect to treat the IRA as an Inherited IRA rather than their own (surviving spouses still have the option to treat Inherited IRAs as their own)
* Minor children of the decedent, until the child reaches the age of 21.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://irahelp.com/slottreport/age-majority-and-new-secure-act-regulations/#:~:text=The%20age%20of%20majority%20is,required%20minimum%20distribution%20(RMD).| title=AGE OF MAJORITY AND THE NEW SECURE ACT REGULATION| author1=Andy Ives| author2=Ed Slott | publisher=The Slott Report|date=March 2, 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Any beneficiary not more than ten years younger than the decedent
* Chronically ill beneficiaries
* Permanently disabled beneficiaries&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.wealthmanagement.com/estate-planning/special-needs-trusts-can-help-secure-stretch-ira| title=Special Needs Trusts Can Help SECURE a 'Stretch' IRA| author1=Robert Dietz | author2=Jennifer Goode | publisher=Wealth Management|date=April 20, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There can be complexity and/or legal ambiguity surrounding the details of some of these definitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.kitces.com/blog/secure-act-stretch-ira-401k-elimination-eligible-designated-beneficiary-retirement-accounts-taxes/| title=The (Partial) Death Of The Stretch IRA: How The SECURE Act Impacts Inherited Retirement Accounts| author=Jeffrey Levine CFP| publisher=Kitces Nerds Eye View| date=February 12, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plans maintained pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement, and governmental plans (such as [[403(b)|403(b)s]] for government employees and [[457(b)|governmental 457(b)s]]) are not impacted by the ten-year rule until January 1, 2022.

==Post-SECURE Act strategies for beneficiaries==

===Roth IRA===

[[Roth IRA]] withdrawals are tax-free, so unless the beneficiary has an urgent need for the funds, the best strategy will generally be to leave the funds inside the Inherited IRA as long as possible, and withdraw a lump sum toward the end of the tenth year after the owner's death. This will maximize tax-free growth. Reasons for deviating from this strategy could include:

* The beneficiary is not able to maximize contributions to their own tax-advantaged accounts, for example, by having access to a large [[Solo 401(k) plan|Solo 401(k)]] or [[After-tax 401(k)|Mega Backdoor Roth]] limit. Withdrawing distributions from an Inherited Roth IRA to make these contributions would be trading one tax-advantaged space for another, but the beneficiary's own accounts do not need to be closed down in ten years or less, and so provide much longer-term tax-advantaged growth potential than the Inherited IRA.
* The beneficiary has debt with a higher interest rate than the expected tax-free return of investments available in the IRA. While the debt probably should not have been taken out in the first place, withdrawing Inherited IRA money to pay it off may be the best solution, along with addressing the problems that led to the debt in the first place.
* Attractive [[Taxable account|taxable]] investments (real estate, private equity, etc.) are available that have higher return potential than the investments inside the Inherited IRA. 

===Traditional IRA===

[[Traditional IRA]] withdrawals are taxable (or at least partly taxable if the IRA has any [[Non-deductible traditional IRA|non-deductible basis]]) so substantial withdrawals can have severe tax consequences. In deciding the best withdrawal strategy, an investor should first understand their tax situation, particularly their [[Marginal tax rate|marginal tax rate]] for various sizes of withdrawals, including federal and state income tax rates, phase-outs of deductions and credits, and other income-based effects such as IRMAA, student loan interest subsides, and financial aid. This information can be obtained from a professional tax preparer, tax software, or other tools such as the [[Tools_and_calculators#Personal_finance_toolbox|Personal Finance Toolbox]]. This information should be estimated, as best as possible, for the next ten years. Factors that affect future income and tax rates could include:

* Planned start or stop of working, for you or your spouse
* Fluctuations in income, including certain career paths that have large changes in income when milestones are reached
* Planned moves between low-tax and high-tax states
* Planned large charitable gifts
* Expected start of Social Security or pension payments
* Possible future leaves of absence (for example, connected to a new child)
* Possible future tax law changes (although these are notoriously hard to predict)

Note that beneficiaries may be able to spread withdrawals over '''11''' tax years, rather than 10, if the owner died early enough in the year for the beneficiary to make a withdrawal before December 31. 

Planned IRA withdrawals could affect [[Traditional versus Roth]] decisions in those years for your own accounts, for example, by favoring Traditional contributions in years with large withdrawals. 

====Lump-sum withdrawal====

A lump-sum withdrawal in the final year maximizes tax-deferred growth, but also concentrates taxable income in a single year, possibly causing the highest average tax rate on withdrawals. This strategy could be optimal in the following situations:

* The IRA balance is small enough such that the lump sum does not push the taxpayer into a higher bracket (for example, as of 2023, the federal 35% single bracket spans nearly $350,000) 
* High-income taxpayers who are already in the top (37%) tax bracket, and are not affected by other factors that would increase the tax rate on the lump sum
* Taxpayers who are just below large spikes in tax rate (for example, due to [[Taxation of Social Security benefits|taxation of Social Security benefits]] or phase-out of [[Marginal_tax_rate#Section_199A_deductions|Section 199A deductions]]) with lower rates above may pay a lower average tax rate by taking a large withdrawal in a single year instead of paying a spiked rate for many years

====Level withdrawals====

Level, or approximately level, withdrawals minimize the greatest taxable income in any given year. This strategy could be optimal in the following situations:

* A lump-sum withdrawal would raise the taxpayer into a higher marginal tax rate than 10 or 11 level withdrawals
* The taxpayer is not able to fully contribute to tax-advantaged accounts without annual withdrawals. Withdrawing from the Inherited IRA and contributing to personally-owned accounts is either tax-neutral (for traditional contributions) or has the effect of a Roth conversion (for Roth contributions), but moves funds into an account without a ten year limit.

The simplest way to do this is to withdraw 1/n of the balance each year, where n is the number of withdrawals remaining.  If the IRA funds are invested as suggested in [[Tax-efficient fund placement]], the real return may be close to 0%.

The following table gives the approximate percentages of the balance that should be withdrawn each year as a function of expected real rate of return, assuming withdrawals are made at year-end and tax brackets are indexed for inflation, and you want to assume something other than a 0% real return:

|}

These values can be approximated by using the ''PMT'' function, with an adjustment factor to change the denominator to the balance at the end of the first period, rather than the beginning: ''=PMT(rate, Nper, -1) / (1 + rate)''

====Accelerated withdrawals====

Accelerated withdrawals will concentrate taxable income in one or several years, and will also forego tax-deferred growth, so will not be optimal for the majority of beneficiaries. However, this strategy could make sense in certain situations, for example, if you suspect you may not live for the entire ten-year distribution period (due to age, health, or other reasons), and are going to leave your assets to higher-tax heirs. In this case, front-loaded withdrawals can be used to pay the tax on Roth conversions of other pre-tax assets (if it can be done at a lower tax rate than your prospective heirs), and/or invested in [[Tax-efficient fund placement|tax-efficient]] assets in a [[Taxable account|taxable account]]. The investments will grow with low tax drag, and your heirs will inherit them with a [[Step-up in basis|step-up in basis]], a significant tax savings.

====Irregular withdrawals====

Irregular withdrawals are the preferred strategy when you expect your tax situation to be significantly different years within the ten year withdrawal period, due to any of the factors listed above. Larger withdrawals should be timed to occur in years where the marginal tax rate is lowest.

==Post-SECURE Act strategies for owners==

The SECURE Act may dramatically change estate planning for those expecting to bequeath substantial IRAs. Prior to the SECURE Act, distributions of Inherited IRAs could be spread over many decades, so the ten-year rule is a dramatic acceleration of required distributions. In response, more complex inter-generational tax planning may be needed to maximize the after-tax value of your estate. Not only will you need to consider your own tax situation, but also the likely tax situation of your prospective heirs. The following strategies should be considered by account owners expecting to leave substantial pre-tax funds in IRAs.

===Spreading out traditional IRAs over many beneficiaries===

Before the SECURE Act, it may have been advantageous to prefer leaving IRAs to younger heirs, to maximize the time period of the stretch. Now, all heirs will need to distribute their Inherited IRAs over roughly the same time period, so distributing pre-tax IRA assets roughly equally among all heirs may now be a better strategy. 

Further optimization can be achieved by tax-adjusting the values of each heir's inheritance based on their expected tax rate. For example, pre-tax assets may be left predominantly toward low-tax heirs, taxable assets to middle-tax heirs, and Roth assets to high-tax heirs. While this was also advisable prior to the SECURE Act, the shorter distribution period for younger heirs will change the effective tax rate calculation. You should consider that this could cause consternation among heirs. For example, lower-income heirs might not fully understand why the nominal value of their share of the inheritance is smaller than their higher-income siblings, or high-income heirs may not understand why the nominal value of pre-tax assets left to lower-income heirs is greater than the value of their Roth assets. 

===Roth conversions===

Partial [[Roth IRA conversion|Roth conversions]] of pre-tax assets during your lifetime will increase the time over which the taxable income is distributed, thus reducing the taxable income per year. If the marginal tax rate of a Roth conversion is less than the marginal tax rate of withdrawals by your heirs, then the Roth conversion will save taxes. This strategy is similar to doing Roth conversions prior to the start of RMDs to reduce the taxable RMD amount.

Roth conversions during your lifetime can make sense if you will leave the IRA or Roth IRA to heirs in trust, especially an “accumulation” (or “discretionary”) trust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fidelity.com/viewpoints/wealth-management/insights/iras-left-to-a-trust#:~:text=Accumulation%20trusts%20differ%20from%20conduit,protected%20from%20any%20outside%20creditors.|title=How the SECURE Act impacts IRAs left to a trust| author1=Fidelity Wealth Management|publisher=Fidelity Investments |date=February 3, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt; A properly set up accumulation trust allows the IRA/Roth to be passed in trust, and the trustee has discretion whether to distribute  directly to the beneficiary, at the beneficiary’s marginal tax rate, but lose the trust protections on the distributions, or to leave the distributions in the trust, subject to typically higher trust tax rates, and keep trust protections. Because a qualifying Roth distribution is non taxable, the higher trust tax rates are avoided and trust protections preserved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://ataxplan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Estate_Planning_for_Retirement_Benefits_post_SECURE_and_Prop_Regs.pdf

===Bypassing the spouse===

A married couple may be able to extend the window over which their heirs will need to distribute pre-tax assets by partially bypassing the surviving spouse. Each spouse would leave some or all of their pre-tax assets directly to their younger heirs, as opposed to their spouse. When the first spouse dies, the ten-year clock begins on those withdrawals. When the surviving spouse dies and bequeaths the remaining pre-tax assets, those accounts get a fresh ten-year clock. This strategy can broaden the effective distribution period to up to 22 years.

===Redirecting Inherited IRAs to EDBs===

In some cases, it may make sense to leave inherited IRAs to certain EDBs, such as a disabled young adult child (often in trust). This can be especially true if inherited IRA balances are not excessively large. The RMDs can be stretched over the EDBs lifetime, leading to relatively small annual distributions and little or no income tax, assuming EDB has minimal other income.  Extreme care must be exercised not to disqualify a disabled EDB from any applicable means tested government benefits. 

Conversely, leaving inherited Roths to a disabled EDB can lead to a lifetime of tax free distributions, especially if dealing with large amounts in trust given higher trust tax rates. 

These particular strategies can be quite complicated and require legal and tax expertise to properly set up and execute. 

===Advanced strategies===

For large IRAs, advanced strategies using a [[Charitable Remainder Trust]] may be able to artificially create similar rules to the Stretch IRA,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.kitces.com/blog/secure-act-stretch-ira-401k-elimination-eligible-designated-beneficiary-retirement-accounts-minimize-taxes/| title=Strategies To Mitigate The (Partial) Death Of The Stretch IRA| author=Jeffrey Levine CFP| publisher=Kitces Nerds Eye View| date=February 19, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; albeit with additional cost and complexity. If you think this may be an appropriate strategy for you, consult a competent estate planning attorney in your state.

{{Warning|The Bogleheads forum regularly receives posts from individuals who have made expensive mistakes with their backdoor Roth. Be sure to read and understand this entire article including proper IRS documentation &lt;i&gt;before&lt;/i&gt; you use the process. There will be significant clean up effort with the IRS if the process is done incorrectly and it may be costly.}}

If you cannot contribute to a [[Roth IRA]] because your income exceeds the income eligibility limit, you can still choose to contribute indirectly through a two step process known informally as the '''backdoor Roth'''.

If you have already made a Roth contribution but now realize your income is too high, the [[IRA_recharacterization|IRA recharacterization]] process allows you to treat that contribution as if it were made to a traditional account instead.

Shown in the figure below, you do the backdoor Roth as follows:

# Make a nondeductible (that is, taxed and not deducted) contribution to a [[traditional IRA]].
# Then [[Roth IRA conversion|convert]] the traditional IRA to a Roth IRA.

The net effect of performing these two steps is equivalent to contributing to a Roth IRA. Because there are no income limits for either of these steps, you can use this backdoor Roth technique to effectively contribute to a Roth IRA regardless of how high your income is. You just need to have compensation in the tax year for which you will be contributing.  Due to the SECURE ACT signed in 2019, there are no longer age limits on IRA contributions. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Benz|first=Christine|date=April 16, 2024|title=You Can Make IRA Contributions at Any Age, but Should You?|url=https://www.morningstar.com/retirement/you-can-make-ira-contributions-any-age-should-you|website=Morningstar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no such IRA called a "backdoor Roth IRA", because the backdoor Roth is a &lt;i&gt;process&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;technique&lt;/i&gt;, not an &lt;i&gt;account&lt;/i&gt;. The IRS does not recognize a "nondeductible traditional IRA", because it is the &lt;i&gt;contributions&lt;/i&gt; that are nondeductible (that is, not deducted), not the &lt;i&gt;IRA&lt;/i&gt;. There is also a &lt;i&gt;process&lt;/i&gt; called [[mega-backdoor Roth]] that is completely different from the backdoor Roth, and they are independent of each other. The IRS does not officially recognize the term "backdoor Roth", and as a result, some tax preparers are not familiar with it either. The term is just a shortcut phrase that investors use. So if you come across someone who has never heard of it, just use the terms "contribute" and "convert" instead, because that is what is really happening.

Before proceeding with a backdoor Roth, consider that it is much easier to contribute directly to a Roth IRA if you are eligible to do so.

==Definitions==
First, there are three terms to understand when doing backdoor Roths:

;Taxable compensation : The IRS defines this as taxable wages, salaries, commissions, self-employment income, alimony and separate maintenance (nontaxable combat pay is also applicable for an IRA contribution). It excludes earnings and profits from property, interest and dividend income, pension or annuity income, deferred compensation, income from certain partnerships, or any amounts (other than combat pay) you exclude from income.&lt;ref name="590A"&gt;{{cite web|title=Publication 590-A (2017), Contributions to Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs)|url=https://www.irs.gov/publications/p590a|accessdate=December 30, 2018|publisher=Internal Revenue Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Traditional IRA : As used on this page, the term refers to each of your non-Roth IRAs, that are also not [[Inheriting an IRA|inherited IRAs]]. These include [[Traditional IRA | traditional IRAs]], [[Rollover IRA | rollover IRAs]] (also known as conduit IRAs), [[SEP | SEP-IRAs]], and [[SIMPLE IRA | SIMPLE IRAs]], including those held at different custodians. The total year-end value of ALL of these accounts will be taken into account when calculating taxes for a backdoor Roth.

; Basis (or cost basis) : This is the total amount of nondeductible contributions in your traditional IRAs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/publications/p590b|title=Publication 590-B (2017), Distributions from Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs)|accessdate=December 11, 2018|publisher=Internal Revenue Service}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a fixed dollar amount and does not grow as the account value grows. It stays steady until one of the following occurs: 1) another nondeductible contribution is added (the basis increases), 2) a rollover of an after-tax 401k contribution is made to a traditional or rollover IRA (the basis increases), 3) a Roth conversion or withdrawal from the account removes some/all of it (the basis decreases).
: The basis also is not associated with any particular account. Rather, it is an accounting device that you would need to report to the IRS each year it changes. You report the increase or decrease in basis using [https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-8606 IRS Form 8606].
: [https://www.irs.gov/publications/p590a#en_US_2020_publink1000230521 IRS Pub. 590-A] refers to this as "cost basis". This is the same word, but has a slightly differently meaning than the [[Cost basis methods |&lt;i&gt;cost basis&lt;/i&gt;]] used when calculating capital gains.
:For more, see: [[Non-deductible traditional IRA#Cost basis|Non-deductible traditional IRA § Cost basis]]

==Overview== 
When you do a backdoor Roth, you first make a nondeductible contribution (that is, already taxed) to a traditional IRA. After that transaction completes (usually in one business day), you do a Roth conversion. 

However, your pre-existing traditional IRAs will likely be entirely deductible contributions and their pre-tax earnings. When you do a Roth conversion, you cannot limit your conversion to just your nondeductible contribution. When filing your income taxes, Form 8606 considers all your traditional IRAs as if the accounts were merged in one traditional IRA, regardless of which account the Roth conversion money came from.

For example: If your nondeductible contribution is only 25% of all the money in your traditional IRAs, then only 25% of your Roth conversion amount will be tax-free. The remaining 75% of your Roth conversion amount will represent the deductible (pre-tax) money across all of your traditional IRAs. Consequently, you will owe tax (at your current income tax rate) on 75% of your Roth conversion amount (see Example 3a below). If you can transfer your pre-tax IRA funds to a solo [[401(k)]], employer-sponsored 401k, or [[403(b)]], then they will no longer be subject to taxation during the Roth conversion process.

However, in the cases where part of the conversion amount was taxed, some of your basis is considered to have been converted tax-free while some still remains for use with the rest of your traditional IRAs. Some of this basis will hang around until all of your traditional IRAs (as defined here) are empty and you will have to file [https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-8606 Form 8606] each year until then.

==Details==
===Contribute===
To do a backdoor Roth, first make a regular contribution to a traditional IRA with your IRA custodian. You do not need to tell the custodian whether the contribution is deductible or not; it is just treated as an IRA contribution. The custodian does not know (or care) if any contribution is deductible or not. That is known only to you, the IRS (and your state, if you file state income taxes), and your tax preparer. In fact, you can change your mind as to any contribution being deductible or not, up until the time you file your tax return.

"Nondeductible" simply means that you do not deduct the IRA contribution on your 1040 tax form. The transaction is recorded on Form 8606 instead and submitted with your tax return. This nondeductible contribution becomes your "basis" if you do not yet have any or is added to your existing "basis" when you prepare your taxes. One important thing to know about your basis, is that it does not grow, except by making additional nondeductible contributions. All the growth for the traditional IRA will instead be pre-tax.

The amount of the nondeductible contribution is limited to the maximum you are eligible to contribute each year, after taking other IRA contributions for the year into account. For example, the maximum IRA contribution in 2024/2025 is $7,000 per person (or $8,000 if over age 50). If you are eligible for, and make, a $4,000 traditional contribution (deductible or nondeductible), you can only make a $3,000  contribution to a Roth IRA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=l|first=Cornell Legal Information Institute|title=26 U.S. Code § 408A - Roth IRAs|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/408A|website=Cornell Law School}}&lt;/ref&gt; You cannot contribute more than your taxable compensation for the year. Non-working married spouses can also contribute to their own IRAs, even if they did not earn any income. The total contribution for both spouses cannot be greater than the total joint taxable compensation.

You can make the contribution up until the April filing deadline of the following year. The conversion can be done any time after that. In this case, you report the nondeductible contribution on Form 8606 for the tax year it applied to, but will not impact your taxes for that tax year. You will report the conversion for the year in which it happened (along with the carried-forward basis). Converting in a later year than the year of contribution would be useful for someone rolling over their traditional or rollover IRA to a 401k at year end where it is not completed by December 31. However, they would then need to file Form 8606 for both years.

===Convert===
After the contribution transaction is complete, convert it to a Roth IRA. (You can also convert more or less than that amount, as will be shown in the examples below.) The Roth account may be an existing or new account. Accomplish this transaction by "moving" or "exchanging" the cash or shares in your traditional IRA and use this to buy cash or shares in a Roth IRA. As an example, at Vanguard this is a fund exchange. Go to the traditional IRA and select "Exch" which is listed next to "Buy" and "Sell." Identify the cash/shares to be moved. Then select the Roth account on the right hand side, and select the destination fund.

Another way to convert is to call the custodian and ask them to do it by giving the originating and destination account numbers and the amount (or fund) to convert.

If you did not have any pre-existing traditional IRAs and your contribution was nondeductible you would normally convert the &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;entire&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; balance, even if the balance is higher or lower than the amount that you contributed. You pay tax only on the growth, if any, above the amount contributed. If you held the nondeductible contributions in the traditional IRA for only a few days, the tax should be minimal.

If you had pre-existing traditional IRAs, and your contribution was nondeductible, the contribution amount is considered your basis and your tax will be [[Traditional_IRA#The_.22pro-rata.22_rule|pro-rated]] over all conversions and withdrawals, until the traditional IRAs are empty.

==Cautions==
If you have pre-tax money in ''any'' traditional IRA, the taxable portion of any conversion you make is prorated over all your traditional IRAs; you cannot convert just the nondeductible amount.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/rollovers-of-after-tax-contributions-in-retirement-plans| title=Rollovers of After-Tax Contributions in Retirement Plans| publisher=IRS| accessdate=August 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are three options for how to deal with an existing traditional IRA getting in the way of a backdoor Roth IRA:

* Convert the entire traditional IRA to Roth, and pay tax on the pre-tax amount of the conversion. For a small traditional IRA this may be the easiest and best option, but if the traditional IRA is large, this will result in a large tax bill. If you are making backdoor Roth IRA contributions, you are in a middle or high tax bracket, so this might be undesirable.
* Roll the pre-tax portion of the traditional IRA into your [[401(k)]] or [[403(b)]] or [[457(b)]] at work, assuming it accepts rollovers. If the employer plan has poor investment options or high fees (or both), this may be undesirable. However, if the employer plan is large and well-managed, it may have access to institutional share classes with even lower expenses than are available in the IRA. 
* Start a business, open an Individual [[401(k)]] that accepts rollovers, and roll over the traditional IRA into the Individual 401(k). The amount of the rollover is not limited by the amount earned by the business. For example, a $10&amp;nbsp;million traditional IRA can be rolled into an Individual 401(k) opened on $10 of legitimately-earned self employment income.

In any case, you have until December 31st of the tax year in which you make the backdoor Roth IRA conversion to empty the traditional IRA. If you still have a traditional IRA balance on December 31st, then the [[Traditional_IRA#The_.22pro-rata.22_rule|pro-rata rule]] will apply to the conversion. For example, if you attempt to make a backdoor Roth IRA contribution of $6,000 while having a traditional IRA with a pre-tax balance of $50,000, then only '''10.7%''' ($6,000 / ($50,000 + $6,000)) of the conversion step will apply to the non-deductible amount, and the remainder will be converted from the pre-tax amount. This will result in '''$5,357''' ($6,000 * (1 - 10.7%)) of taxable income.

Because IRAs are ''individual'' accounts, the IRAs of one spouse do not affect the proration of the other spouse's conversion, even when filing tax Married Filing Jointly. Similarly, if someone has an inherited IRA with some basis in it as well as their own traditional IRAs (with or without basis), the tax calculations for the inherited IRA are done separately from the other traditional IRAs the beneficiary may have. In these cases, spouses need to file Form 8606 individually as well as for each inherited IRA having a basis.

When you leave an employer and you want to roll the employer's retirement plan to an IRA, request a single distribution but direct the after-tax distributions to a Roth IRA and the pre-tax distributions to a rollover IRA (which is one of the forms of a traditional IRA). While money is in the rollover IRA, DO NOT make any other contributions directly to that account. This will help make it possible for a future employer plan to accept the rollover IRA, because some employer plans do not accept money from contributory traditional IRAs (IRAs to which you contributed directly, instead of withheld from your paycheck). In other words, keep your rollover IRAs separated from your other IRAs. If you have already co-mingled employer plan rollovers with IRAs you have contributed to, the plan documents from a future employer plan will tell if the rollover back to a 401k or 403b is allowed.

Before you start the backdoor Roth, you should also understand IRS Form 8606 (examples below), as you will file it with your income taxes for the year. Fill out a rough draft of the form to understand the tax implications and see if the contribution or conversion impacts anything else in your tax situation. The front of the form deals with your basis from the previous and the current year, while part of the back of the form deals with the Roth conversion. Understanding this formula will help you see what part of your Roth conversion or traditional IRA withdrawal will be tax-free and how much will be taxed:

==Examples with Form 8606==

The [https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-8606 Form 8606] examples below use the following simple formula:
:'''ND''' = Amount of basis remaining from the previous year '''plus''' nondeductible contributions made for this year&lt;br&gt;
:'''SB''' = Sum of the balances of all your traditional IRAs at year-end '''plus''' the amount withdrawn from traditional IRAs (but not converted) '''plus''' the amount converted&lt;br&gt;
:'''TF''' = The percentage of the amount you convert (or withdraw without converting) that is tax-free for the year
::TF = 100 * ( ND / SB )

The examples use graphics to illustrate the pro rata rule. This color key shows the tax status of the various portions of the money.

A chart showing the data to be entered on Form 8606 for each example follows at the end.

===Example 1===
Ann has no traditional IRAs. She knows she will pay the same amount of tax on $6,000 of her high income (for 2019) whether she deposits it into her taxable account or puts it in a Roth. She is ineligible to contribute to the Roth directly due to her high income. So it is obvious for her to put it in a Roth where it can grow tax-free. She opens up a new traditional IRA and deposits $6,000 in it and will declare it as a nondeductible contribution when she files her taxes. A few days later, she converts all of it to her Roth. The tax-free amount of the conversion is:

::TF = 100 * [ 6,000 / 6,000 ] which is 100%.

{| style="border: 1px solid darkgray;"
|+ '''Example 1'''
|-
||[[File:Backdoorroth2.jpg]]
|}

===Example 1a===
Ann made the contribution right before a holiday and forgot to convert the following business day. When she remembered it, the traditional IRA balance had &lt;i&gt;grown $60&lt;/i&gt;. So now she has a basis of $6,000 and the account value is $6,060. The tax-free amount of the conversion is:

::TF = 100 * [ 6,000 / 6,060 ] which is 99%.

If she converts it all, she will pay taxes on 1% of the conversion amount ($60). Although there is rounding in the percentage, she will be able to subtract her basis ($6,000) from the converted amount. There will be no basis left.

If she only converts the $6,000, 99% of the $6,000 basis ($5,940) will go with the converted amount and 1% of the basis ($60) will remain behind. So she would still need to pay taxes on the $60 that was converted but was not tax-free. Next year, she can convert the remaining $60 tax-free since it has a $60 basis, assuming there is no growth meanwhile. To keep things simple, she decides to convert all of it now.

{| style="border: 1px solid darkgray;"
|+ '''Example 1a'''
|-
||[[File:Backdoorroth3.jpg]]
|}

===Example 1b===
Ann made the contribution right before a holiday and forgot to convert the following business day. When she remembered it, the traditional IRA balance had &lt;i&gt;fallen $60&lt;/i&gt;. So now she has a basis of $6,000 and the account value is $5,940. The tax-free amount of the conversion is:

::TF = 100 * [ 6,000 / 5,940 ] which is 101%.

Because the tax-free percentage cannot be more than 100%, it resets to 100%. If she converts it all, she will pay no taxes on the conversion. What happens with the remaining basis ($60) is unclear. Leaving a dollar in the account and converting $5,939 ''might'' make it more likely she will retain $61 basis instead of losing $60 basis. This will be useful if she has future growth (or a deductible contribution of at least $61) in her traditional IRA because she will be able to convert $61 of it tax-free.

===Example 2===
Ben has $50,000 of deductible contributions and its growth in his traditional IRA, and has some taxable money he can use to pay most (but not all) of the conversion taxes. He also has a rollover IRA with $350,000 that contains only a 401k rolled over from a former employer and growth since the rollover. He is not eligible to contribute to a Roth directly but wants to do a backdoor Roth. It will be his first time for a backdoor Roth and he thinks he would also like to do one in the following year as he will convert half of the traditional IRA each year.

===Example 2a===
This year, before Ben starts the backdoor Roth, he rolls over the rollover IRA into a new 401k he has with a new employer.

Then he makes a nondeductible contribution of $6,000 to his traditional IRA, which brings the account value up to $56,000. Then he converts half of the IRA ($28,000), saving the other half for a Roth conversion in the following year. But by the end of the year, the $28,000 remaining in the traditional IRA grows another $4,000 giving the IRA a year-end value of $32,000. (Note that the Roth may have also grown the same amount.) The tax-free amount of the conversion is:

::TF = 100 * [ 6,000 / (32,000 + 0 + 28,000) ] = 100 * [ 6,000 / 60,000 ] which is 10%.

This makes 10% of his $28,000 conversion ($2,800) be tax free and $25,200 ($28,000 - $2,800) will be taxed. It also leaves $3,200 of his basis unused ($6,000 - $2,800).

{| style="border: 1px solid darkgray;"
|+ '''Example 2a'''
|-
||[[File:Backdoorroth5.jpg]]
|}

===Example 2b===
In the following year, if he converts before the account changes value again, Ben will withdraw the amount of $32,000, but this time he messes up and withholds 15% ($4,800) for federal taxes. This is a withdrawal amount that is NOT converted and there will be a 10% penalty on the pre-tax portion of the withheld amount, in additional to income tax, for early withdrawal if he is not yet 59.5. (Penalties are calculated on Form 5329.) He converts the remaining $27,200. A while later in the year, he makes a nondeductible contribution of $6,000 and converts it the following day. At the end of the year, his traditional IRAs are all empty. For this following year, there will be a tax-free amount of:

::TF = 100 * [(3,200 + 6,000) / (0 + 4,800 + 27,200 + 6,000)] = 100 * [ 9,200 / 38,000 ] which is 24.21%

This makes 24.21% of his $4,800 withdrawal ($1,162) and 24.21% of his $27,200 + $6,000 conversions ($8,038) be tax free. That leaves $3,638 of the withdrawal for tax withholding ($4,800 - 1,162) and $25,162 of the two conversions ($33,200 - 8,038) to be taxed. It also leaves no basis (or any other money) in his traditional IRA.

Note that the IRS is still holding the entire $4,800 to apply to his tax liability although part of that withholding is not taxed (that is, $1,162). That is just like the Roth holding the entire $33,200 ($27,200 + 6,000) even though some of it is not taxed (that is, $8,038).

===Example 3===
Chris is nearing retirement and wants to be ready to do some large Roth conversions on her 401k before starting Social Security. She plans to roll some of it into a traditional IRA right after she retires, but will leave it alone for this year and next. But to clean things up before then, she wants to 1) finish converting her small SEP-IRA from a former employer, 2) do a backdoor Roth each year while working, and 3) draw down an inherited traditional IRA from her mother. Her mother had been doing backdoor Roths but died before she had converted everything in her traditional IRA. 

Inherited traditional IRAs and inherited Roth IRAs can not receive new contributions nor be converted. They can only have withdrawals taken out. Although Chris had inherited half of her mother's traditional IRA and Roth IRA, the inherited &lt;i&gt;Roth&lt;/i&gt; IRA is irrelevant to this example. But the remaining basis in the inherited &lt;i&gt;traditional&lt;/i&gt; IRA still needs to be addressed (and is useful for account owners to know if they will be leaving basis in their traditional IRAs for their heirs).

===Example 3a===
Chris needs to process her own accounts separate from the inherited IRA. Her SEP-IRA only contains $15,000 and she wants to do a $5,000 backdoor Roth. She opens up a new traditional IRA account and makes the $5,000 nondeductible contribution to it. Between the two accounts, they total $20,000 and $5,000 is the basis. She converts the entire traditional IRA and $5,000 of the SEP-IRA, leaving only $10,000 in the SEP-IRA at the end of the year. To calculate the tax-free part of the $10,000 in Roth conversions:

::TF = 100 * [ 5,000 / (10,000 + 0 + 10,000) ] = 100 * [ 5,000 / 20,000 ] = which is 25%.

This makes 25% of her $10,000 conversion ($2,500) be tax-free and $7,500 ($10,000 - $2,500) will be taxed. It also leaves $2,500 of her basis ($5,000 - $2,500) left for a future year.

{| style="border: 1px solid darkgray;"
|+ '''Example 3a'''
|-
||[[File:Backdoorroth7.jpg]]
|}

===Example 3b===
The remaining account value of the inherited (traditional) IRA is $60,000 of which $20,000 is the remaining basis from the previous year. (When receiving the inherited IRA, if the deceased had high compensation, the executor or trustee of the estate should look at the deceased's past tax returns to see if there was remaining basis reported on Form 8606.) Withdrawals from an inherited IRA cannot be converted. In the current year, Chris withdraws $40,000 (more than her Required Minimum Distribution) and the tax-free percentage of the inherited IRA withdrawal is:

::TF = 100 * [ 20,000 / (20,000 + 40,000 + 0) ] = 100 * [ 20,000 / 60,000 ] = which is 33.33%.

This makes 33.33% of her $40,000 withdrawal ($13,333) be tax-free and $26,667 ($40,000 - $13,333) will be taxed. It also leaves $6,667 of her basis ($20,000 - $13,333) left for a future year.

{| style="border: 1px solid darkgray;"
|+ '''Example 3b'''
|-
||[[File:Backdoorroth8.jpg]]
|}

Chris will need to file two copies of Form 8606 for the year, one for her own accounts and one for the inherited IRA. They will maintain separate carry-over bases. If she is married, her spouse will also have to file a separate Form 8606 with a separate pro rata calculation, if needed.

===Form 8606 calculations===

===Using tax software===
To report a full backdoor Roth procedure in Turbo Tax (at least, and possibly in other software), it is often helpful to skip the tax software's default order of data entry, which asks you about income first, and IRA contributions later.&lt;ref name="crit"&gt;{{Forum post| p=4291809|title=Re: Wiki page UPGRADE: Backdoor Roth|date=31 December 2018|author=crit}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Enter your other income and wages as usual, but do NOT enter the 1099-R from your IRA distribution on your first pass. Instead, after entering other income, navigate manually to the IRA contribution section. You can do this by clicking on the tabs for 'Federal Taxes', then scroll down under 'Deductions and Credits' to the 'Retirement and Investments' section, and click on the 'Start' button for contributions. As noted above, in the backdoor process, you made a contribution to a traditional IRA, so that is what you report -- not a Roth contribution.&lt;ref name="crit" /&gt;

Once you have completed the contributions section, use the manual navigation again to go back to the income section, and now enter the information from the 1099R that reports the distribution from that traditional IRA. This step reports the conversion of the traditional IRA to Roth IRA. Be careful to enter exactly which boxes were checked for the distribution.&lt;ref name="crit" /&gt;

Once you have completed both the contribution and the 1099-R steps, use the 'Forms' view to check that your Form 8606 has been created correctly.&lt;ref name="crit" /&gt;

For examples of screen shots while doing data entry in popular tax software programs, you can also look at [[The Finance Buff|The Finance Buff's]] blog pages for 
TaxAct,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thefinancebuff.com/how-to-backdoor-roth-taxact.html|title=How to Report Backdoor Roth in TaxAct|accessdate=January 1, 2019|publisher=The Finance Buff}}&lt;/ref&gt; TurboTax,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thefinancebuff.com/how-to-report-backdoor-roth-in-turbotax.html|title=How to Report Backdoor Roth in TurboTax|accessdate=January 1, 2019|publisher=The Finance Buff}}&lt;/ref&gt; H&amp;R Block software,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thefinancebuff.com/how-to-backdoor-roth-hr-block-software.html|title=How to Report Backdoor Roth in H&amp;R Block Software|accessdate=January 1, 2019|publisher=The Finance Buff}}&lt;/ref&gt; or FreeTaxUSA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thefinancebuff.com/how-to-backdoor-roth-freetaxusa.html|title=How to Report Backdoor Roth in FreeTaxUSA|accessdate=January 1, 2019|publisher=The Finance Buff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To see how multiple years of Form 8606 should look (for example, if you neglected to file several years and now want to rectify things), or to see the interaction between Form 8606 and Worksheet 1-1 in Publication 590-B, the 'Form8606' tab of the [[Tools_and_calculators#Personal_finance_toolbox|Personal finance toolbox]]&lt;ref name ="MrMoney"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://forum.mrmoneymustache.com/forum-information-faqs/case-study-spreadsheet-updates/| title=The MMM Case Study Spreadsheet| publisher=The Mr. Money Mustache Community| accessdate=January 23, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; is useful.

{{main|IRA rollovers and transfers}}

{{401k rollover infobox}}
Individuals may execute rollovers of retirement plan assets to an IRA when they change jobs or retire. These transfers offer an opportunity to consolidate retirement assets into a single account, reduce costs, and expand investment options. The recipient accounts which receive plan assets are often termed '''{{PAGENAME}}s'''. 

Rollover IRAs are also sometimes referred to as Conduit IRAs, since they can also be used to hold assets rolled over from one employer provided plan until rolled over into another employer provided plan.

A rollover IRA is created by one of two methods: trustee-to-trustee transfer (usually the preferred method); and rollover. For more on these transfer options, see [[IRA rollovers and transfers]].

* Distributions must be made directly to the charitable organization.{{#tag:ref|From the Oblivious Investor (Mike Piper) website:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://obliviousinvestor.com/qualified-charitable-distributions-qcds-concerns-from-first-timers/| title=Qualified Charitable Distributions (QCDs): Concerns from First-Timers| publisher=Oblivious Investor| date=December 2, 2024| accessdate=October 22, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{blockquote|The IRC section that defines qualified charitable distributions (§ 408(d)(8)(B)) explicitly states that the distribution must be made “directly” by the trustee to the qualifying non-profit organization. So I understand why people might be concerned if the check arrives in their own mailbox. But, to be clear:
*It’s OK if the check is ''made out to'' the charity but ''delivered'' to you and you forward it to the charity.
*It’s ''not'' OK for the check to be made out to you (or for the funds to be electronically distributed from the IRA to your own account). In that case it’s not a QCD. It’s just a regular distribution.
In fact, that’s often preferable to have the check made out to the charity but mailed to you, because it gives you a chance to scan the check for your records}}|group="note"}}
* The IRA owner must be over 70 1/2 years old.&lt;ref&gt;Some choose to wait until 73 years old and use the QCD as part of the RMD, making sure to get as much of tax benefit as possible by offsetting all or part of your RMD income. In addition the resulting lower AGI/MAGI can have other taxes benefits related to AGI/MAGI threshold based deductions or income. &lt;/ref&gt;

QCDs must come from an [[Traditional IRA|individual IRA]] or a [[Roth IRA]]. An [[SEP]] or [[SIMPLE IRA]] also qualify if there are no active contributions.&lt;ref name="590B" /&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;[https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-07-07.pdf IRS Notice N-07-07] (A-36) defines a QCD for any type of IRA (including a Roth IRA) that is neither an (''on-going'' SEP or ''on-going'' SIMPLE IRA). An SEP or SIMPLE IRA is ''on-going'' if it is maintained under an employer arrangement under which an employer contribution is made for the plan year ending with or within the IRA owner’s taxable year in which the charitable contributions would be made. As employer retirement plans (such as a [[401(k)]], [[403(b)]], or the federal [[Thrift Savings Plan#Qualified charitable distributions|Thrift Savings Plan]]) are not mentioned, they do not qualify for QCDs.&lt;/ref&gt;

If you file a joint return, your spouse can also have a QCD and exclude an equal amount. The amount of the QCD is limited to the amount of the distribution that would otherwise be included in income. If your IRA includes nondeductible contributions, the distribution is first considered to be paid out of otherwise taxable income.&lt;ref name="590B" /&gt;

When using a QCD as part of your RMD, because the first money withdrawn from your IRA is your Required Minimum Distribution (RMD), it is a good habit to take the QCDs at the start of the year and complete drawing your RMDs nearer the end of the year. That way, you do not withdraw more taxable income than necessary.&lt;ref name="DeMuth"&gt;{{forum link| p=8418533| title=Re: Phil DeMuth joined me on the "Bogleheads on Investing" podcast ...| date=June 24, 2025}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Guidance==
You can find a comprehensive "How to" guide on the Michael Kitces blog. See: [https://www.kitces.com/blog/qualified-charitable-distribution-qcd-from-ira-to-satisfy-rmd-rules-and-requirements/ Rules To Do An IRA Qualified Charitable Distribution]

It is important to note that to be a valid QCD, the funds must be paid directly from your IRA custodian to the qualified charitable organization. The QCD money is a direct transfer to the charity that never passes through the hands of the IRA holder. Instead, the IRA custodian can either send an electronic transfer of funds or a check directly to the charity.&lt;ref name="Fidelity"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.fidelitycharitable.org/guidance/philanthropy/qualified-charitable-distribution.html| title=Qualified Charitable Distribution| publisher=Fidelity Charitable| accessdate=June 27, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt; Distributing the funds to yourself and then gifting to a charity does not qualify as a QCD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.fidelity.com/retirement-ira/required-minimum-distributions-qcds| title=Qualified Charitable Distributions (QCDs) - planning your IRA withdrawal| publisher=Fidelity| accessdate=June 27, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt; QCDs cannot be made to Donor Advised Funds.&lt;ref name="Fidelity" /&gt;

Also it is a good idea when creating a QCD to specifically instruct the applicable brokerage to write the name and address of the donor on the check that is issued in order to receive an acknowledgment from the charity. The brokerage may have procedures that prevent them from releasing this information without permission.&lt;ref name="DeMuth" /&gt;

==Benefits of a QCD==
* Allows someone using the standard deduction to realize a tax advantage from a charitable contribution.{{#tag:ref|In addition to the benefits of giving to charity, a QCD excludes the amount donated from taxable income, which is unlike regular withdrawals from an IRA. Keeping your taxable income lower may reduce the impact to certain tax credits and deductions, including Social Security and Medicare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.fidelity.com/building-savings/learn-about-iras/required-minimum-distributions/qcds| title=Qualified Charitable Distributions (QCDs)| publisher=Fidelity Investments| accessdate=August 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group="note"}}
** [[Required Minimum Distribution|Required Minimum Distributions]] (RMDs) and additional distributions from an IRA are part of your taxable income. QCDs do not count as taxable income, so you can lower your taxable income by the amount of your QCD, which lowers your taxes. This is beneficial if you use the standard deduction instead of itemizing.

* A QCD done as part of an RMD lowers your AGI (adjusted gross income), which may increase the tax benefit of AGI based deductions such as medical expenses or miscellaneous itemized deductions. 

* A QCD done as part of an RMD lowers your MAGI (modified adjusted gross income), which could decrease the amount of NIIT (net investment income tax).&lt;ref name=":0" group="note"&gt;The IRS MAGI calculation is based on the type of income. See: [[Modified Adjusted Gross Income]]&lt;/ref&gt;

* Allows those at or near the earnings limit for higher Medicare premiums to lower their MAGI which could lower their future [[Income-Related Monthly Adjustment Amount (IRMAA)|IRMAA]] adjustment.&lt;ref name=":0" group="note" /&gt;

* For those states that have an income tax, but don’t have a charitable contributions deduction, the tax benefit of a QCD may be comparatively even greater.&lt;ref name="DeMuth" /&gt;

* With the passage of the [https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Big_Beautiful_Bill_Act OBBBA] in 2025, starting in 2026, only charitable contributions over 0.5% of AGI will be deductible as an itemized deduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://natlawreview.com/article/one-big-beautiful-bill-effect-exempt-organizations#:~:text=Individual%20Donors:%20Individuals%20may%20now,and%20$1%2C000%20for%20everyone%20else.| title=OBBB Reshapes Nonprofit Tax Rules and Charitable Deductions| publisher=The National Law Review| accessdate=October 22, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt; QCDs are not subject to this threshold, making them comparatively more attractive than charitable contributions as itemized deductions.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' contains examples related to the [[Traditional versus Roth|traditional versus Roth]] page.

Many of the charts below have been generated by the [https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Tools_and_calculators#Personal_finance_toolbox personal finance toolbox] Excel spreadsheet.&lt;ref name ="MrMoney"&gt;[http://forum.mrmoneymustache.com/forum-information-faqs/case-study-spreadsheet-updates/ The MMM Case Study Spreadsheet], [http://forum.mrmoneymustache.com/index.php MrMoneyMustache Forum], viewed June 10, 2019.&lt;/ref&gt; That handles most common tax situations, and is suggested as a tool many may find useful for an overview of their own situations.

==Simple step changes in marginal rates==

When [https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Progressive_tax#Taxable_income taxable income] is close to a tax bracket boundary, you could choose to make traditional contributions until the marginal rate drops, then use Roth for further contributions. For a single person making $60K/yr, a little over $8K to a traditional 401k would save 22% but further traditional contributions would save only 12%, as shown here:
[[File:Marginal_rate_step_change.PNG|frame|none|Tax Rate vs. 401k Contribution (negative values because tax decreases as contributions go up)]]
If that person expected to pay a marginal rate of 15% on withdrawals in retirement, the $8K saving 22% should go to traditional while the remaining $11K should go to Roth.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Similarly, a married couple retired at age 55 with $5K/yr of qualified dividends, looking at doing Roth conversions before starting Social Security, could take significant amounts from traditional accounts at 12% and lower rates:
[[File:Marginal_rate_step_change2.PNG|frame|none|Tax Rate vs. tIRA Withdrawal]]
If that couple expected to pay a higher marginal rate on withdrawals once social security benefits start (e.g., see below), doing significant amounts of traditional to Roth conversions at these lower rates would be the indicated strategy.

==Business tax considerations==
The loss of a [[Marginal_tax_rate#Section_199A_deductions|Section 199A Deduction]] lowers the federal marginal tax rate on business contributions by 20% (for example, from 32% to 25.6%). Business owners may be able to get a larger Section 199A deduction by contributing through a [[mega-backdoor Roth]] rather than deducting traditional business contributions. This requires a customized [[Solo_401(k)_plan|Solo 401(k)]] through a Third Party Administrator, with setup and operating fees. Fee-free Solo 401(k) plans offered by major brokerages do not allow Mega Backdoor Roth contributions, although some offer a Roth option for elective deferrals. Owners of Specified Service Trades or Businesses (SSTBs) in the income phase-out range for Section 199A deductions ($164,900-$214,900 for single filers, and $329,800-$429,800 for married joint filers as of 2021&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=March 16, 2022|title=Qualified Business Income Deduction (QBI): What It Is &amp; Who Qualifies|url=https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/taxes/qualified-business-income-deduction|access-date=June 5, 2022|website=NerdWallet}}&lt;/ref&gt;) can see [[Tax_analysis#Variable_Marginal_Rates_with_Section_199A_Deduction|very high marginal tax rates]] and should probably choose traditional contributions.

==When larger amounts may be beneficial, even though smaller amounts are not==
The U.S. tax code is not as straightforward as the oft-cited [https://www.bankrate.com/finance/taxes/tax-brackets.aspx federal tax brackets] suggest. Looking only at those brackets, you could expect 
* increasing traditional contributions will save either the same or lower marginal tax rates, and
* increasing traditional withdrawals will incur either the same or higher marginal tax rates.
When that happens (e.g., see the simple cases above), the "Marginal" line on the charts provides all the information you need.

Due to various credits, phase-outs, tiers, cliffs, etc., however, the full tax code doesn't always work that way. For example, you may sometimes find
* increasing traditional contributions will save higher marginal tax rates, or
* increasing traditional withdrawals will incur lower marginal tax rates.
When that happens (e.g., see the more complex cases below that cover both these situations), use the "Cumulative" line on the charts to find the marginal rate on the whole contribution or withdrawal amount.

===Worth reaching the saver's credit?===
The [https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Saver%27s_credit saver's credit] can provide a high marginal tax saving rate in an otherwise low tax bracket, but the actual rate depends on how much you must contribute to reach that credit.

The first chart shows the situation for a single filer starting with an Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) $500 above the first saver's credit tier. The first $500 of traditional IRA contributions would save only 12%, but contributing any amount between $500 and $2000 would save 22%. Above $2000 the marginal rate drops back to 12%.
[[File:Close_to_savers_credit_tier.PNG|frame|none|Tax Rate vs. tIRA Contribution (Initial AGI only $500 above the first saver's credit tier)]]

The second chart shows the situation for a single filer starting with an Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) $5500 above the first saver's credit tier. The first $5500 of traditional IRA contributions still save 12%, but here the highest marginal rate is only a little over 15%.
[[File:Far_from_savers_credit_tier.PNG|frame|none|Tax Rate vs. tIRA Contribution (Initial AGI $5500 above the first saver's credit tier)]]

A person expecting a marginal rate at withdrawal near 15% might split contributions $2000 to traditional and $4000 to Roth in the first case, but put all $6000 to Roth in the second case.

===Worth pushing through the Social Security hump and/or IRMAA cliffs?===
Let's look at a single filer, age 66, receiving $30K/yr SS benefits and $20K/yr qualified dividends.

For this person, the overlap of the 85% SS benefit taxation phase-in with the start of the 15% qualified dividend bracket produces a marginal rate of 1.85 * (12% + 15%) = 49.95% over a $7K band. Beyond that, "normal" tax bracket rates apply, until Medicare premium spikes due to IRMAA tiers appear. In picture form: 

[[File:SS and IRMAA overall.PNG]]

When determining "how much to withdraw (and perhaps convert to Roth) from traditional accounts?" the answer will almost certainly be "just enough to reach (but not exceed) the SS hump, one of the IRMAA spikes, or one of the step increases in the Marginal curve." But which one?

The answer will often depend on the size of the traditional account and thus the expected RMD amounts. 

If the traditional account balance is $100K, RMDs might be ~$5K/yr and it would not be worthwhile converting much more than that, due to the steep increase in marginal rates at low conversion amounts.

But if the traditional account balance is ~$1 million, it could be worthwhile to convert $159K/yr - just up to the change from the 24% to 32% bracket (the 3.8% NIIT spans the 24%/32% bracket transition). That's because the marginal rate on a $50K RMD (the Cumulative curve) will be about the same as the marginal rate on a $159K conversion (the Cumulative curve again). As discussed in [https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Traditional_versus_Roth#Maxing_out_your_retirement_accounts Maxing out your retirement accounts], paying the conversion tax with taxable account funds gives a small advantage to the Roth. Also, reducing the size of the taxable account will reduce the taxable dividends and thus the size of the 49.95% hump.

You may reasonably ask if the marginal rate only on the amount starting at the first IRMAA tier (or any other "temporary" marginal rate increase) would be overly high. Such an analysis is shown below. In this case, you could reach the same conclusion: the large conversion would incur about the same marginal rate as expected RMDs.

[[File:IRMAA worst case.PNG]]

Of course, other assumptions (e.g., that RMDs will be directed to Qualfified Charitable Contributions and thus incur no tax) can be made. Other situations have additional considerations, such as MFJ filing now but potential single filing by the survivor later. Thus, as may be painfully clear by now, the answer in many (most? all?) situations must begin "It depends on...".

==Some rules of thumb==
The main [[Traditional_versus_Roth | Traditional versus Roth]] article explores, in depth, the factors that can affect this analysis. Below are some common "rules of thumb" that may be appropriate, but as noted above there are many "it depends on..." exceptions. Evaluating your own specific situation remains the recommended approach, but the lists below provide some things to consider.

Traditional contributions are usually preferred in these situations:
* Middle-income and higher earners in their peak earnings years, who expect to work a normal-length career and save a normal percentage of their income
* Low-income investors who can realize a substantial tax savings through lowering Adjusted Gross Income, due to the [https://www.irs.gov/credits-deductions/individuals/earned-income-tax-credit-eitc Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC)], [[Saver%27s_credit | Saver's credit]], [http://www.irs.gov/Credits-&amp;-Deductions/Individuals/Premium-Tax-Credit-Affordable-Care-Act ACA subsides], lowering interest payments on an income-driven repayment plan for loans expected to be forgiven under [http://www.irs.gov/Credits-&amp;-Deductions/Individuals/Premium-Tax-Credit-Affordable-Care-Act Public Service Loan Forgiveness], and other benefits
* Investors with expected future low-income years (due to volatile incomes, planned leaves of absence, early retirement, etc.) which would provide opportunities for [[Roth IRA conversion|Roth conversions]] at low tax rates
* Investors with little-to-no traditional savings already, and little-to-no expected taxable income in retirement

Partial or total Roth contributions are usually preferred in these situations:
* Middle-income and higher earners in unusually low-income years (due to unemployment, leave of absence, training, sabbatical, part-time work, early in a career before peak earnings, etc.)
* [[Importance of saving rate|Heavy savers]], who have (or expect to have) large traditional and/or [[Taxable account|taxable]] balances that will create high taxable income in retirement, due to [[SEC Yield|yield]], planned withdrawals, and [[Required Minimum Distribution|Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs)]]
* Investors who expect to have sources of significant taxable income in retirement (pensions, royalties, real estate income not sheltered by depreciation, [[Variable annuity|annuity]] income, [[Stretch IRA|Inherited IRAs]], etc.)
* Investors who expect a [[Taxation_of_Social_Security_benefits|spike in Social Security taxation]] to give them a significantly higher marginal tax rate in retirement than they have now; this affects primarily investors in the 12% bracket
* Members of the military, who often are legal residents of tax-free states, receive part of their compensation tax-free, and expect significant pensions in retirement
* Investors planning to retire to a [[State income taxes|higher-tax state]] (asymmetric state taxation rules can change this analysis)
* Investors planning to leave their savings to heirs with a higher expected tax rate, and/or leave large traditional accounts to their heirs; see [[Stretch IRA]]
* Investors with [[Traditional_versus_Roth#Very_high_income_and_wealth|very high income and wealth]], who are in the top tax bracket now and expect to remain there throughout retirement, and/or expect to leave estates larger than the estate tax exemption; see [[Traditional_versus_Roth#Estate_planning|Estate planning]]

{{for|additional information|wikipedia:Individual retirement account}}

An '''individual retirement account''', or '''IRA''', is a personal savings plan which allows you to set aside money for retirement, while offering you tax advantages. You may be able to deduct some or all of your contributions to your IRA. Amounts in your IRA, including earnings, generally are not taxed until distributed to you. IRAs cannot be owned jointly. However, any amounts remaining in your IRA upon your death can be paid to your beneficiary or beneficiaries.

You can open an IRA at a bank or other financial institution or with a mutual fund or life insurance company. You can also open an IRA through your stockbroker. Any IRA must meet Internal Revenue Code requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|format=pdf|url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p590a.pdf |title=IRS Pub 590-A Contributions to Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs)| publisher=IRS| accessdate= 12 March 2020| page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==

There are three types of IRAs.&lt;ref name="408."&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/408 | title=Individual retirement accounts | publisher=Cornell Legal Information Institute |series = 26 USC §408.| accessdate=September 10, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#'''Individual retirement account:''' A trust created or organized in the US for the exclusive benefit of an individual or his beneficiaries.
#'''Individual retirement annuity:''' An [[:Category:Annuities|annuity]] contract or an endowment contract issued by an insurance company.
#'''Accounts established by employers and certain associations of employees:''' A trust created or organized in the US by an employer for the exclusive benefit of his employees or their beneficiaries, or by an association of employees for the exclusive benefit of its members or their beneficiaries. Examples include [[SEP]], [[Salary_Reduction_Simplified_Employee_Pension_Plan|SARSEP]], and [[SIMPLE_IRA|SIMPLE]] IRAs. See: [[Employer retirement plans overview]].

==Traditional IRA==
A traditional IRA can be an individual retirement account or an annuity. It can be part of either a [[SEP]] (Simplified Employee Pension) or an employer or employee association trust account.&lt;ref name="590A"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/publications/p590a| title=Publication 590-A (2020), Contributions to Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs) | publisher=Internal Revenue Service |series = | date = March 5, 2021 | accessdate=July 23, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional IRA was created in 1974 with the passage of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA).&lt;ref group="note"&gt;See {{cite web |url=https://www.ici.org/pdf/per11-01.pdf |title=The Individual Retirement Account at Age 30: A Retrospective |last= |first= |website= |publisher=Investment Company Institute |date=February 2005 | series =Perspective, V11, N1| access-date=March 14, 2017 |quote=}} for a history of the Traditional IRA to 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years, the Traditional IRA has been expanded to include a growing number of specialized plan types. These include the following:

&lt;center&gt;
{| class="wikitable"
! style="width: 200px;"| Type of IRA
! style="width: 600px;"| Description
|-
|[[Traditional IRA]] || Original type of IRA. Allows tax-deductible contributions, subject to income limitations, and offers tax-deferred growth. Withdrawals are taxable, except for return of basis, which is "pro-rata."
|-
|[[Roth IRA]] || Contributions are after-tax but all future growth and withdrawals are tax-free. Contributions are subject to income limits. Shares a contribution limit with the Traditional IRA.
|-
|[[SEP|SEP (Simplified Employee Pension) IRAs]] || Retirement plan for self-employed individuals with no employees, and a simpler alternative to the [[Solo 401(k) plan|Solo 401(k)]]. Contributions are tax-deductible, growth is tax-deferred, and withdrawals are taxable. Contribution limit is independent from Traditional and Roth IRAs.
|-
|[[SIMPLE IRA|SIMPLE IRAs]] || Retirement plan for small businesses with employees, and a simpler alternative to the [[401(k)]]. Its use excludes the use of any other employer retirement plan, including the SEP-IRA. Employer matching is permitted. Contributions are tax-deductible, growth is tax-deferred, and withdrawals are taxable. Contribution limit is independent from Traditional and Roth IRAs.
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

Your contribution to an IRA is limited by the amount of compensation you receive during the year. Compensation includes wages, salaries, etc., commissions, self-employment income, taxable alimony and separate maintenance, nontaxable combat pay, taxable non-tuition fellowship and stipend payments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Publication 590-A (2021), Contributions to Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs)|url=https://www.irs.gov/publications/p590a|access-date=February 19, 2022|website=Internal Revenue Service|series="Who Can Open a Traditional IRA?" and Table 1-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

See [[Roth versus Traditional]] for more guidance on how to choose between pre-tax and Roth contributions.

===Individual retirement annuity===
You can open an individual retirement annuity by purchasing an annuity contract or an endowment contract from a life insurance company.&lt;ref name="590A" /&gt;

An individual retirement annuity must be issued in your name as the owner, and either you or your beneficiaries who survive you are the only ones who can receive the benefits or payments.&lt;ref name="590A" /&gt;

Annuities may follow different rules than an individual retirement account. For example, special rules apply to figuring the [[Required Minimum Distribution |required minimum distribution]].{{#tag:ref |Special rules apply if you receive distributions from your traditional IRA as an annuity purchased from an insurance company. See Regulations sections 1.401(a)(9)-6 and 54.4974-2. These regulations can be found in many libraries, and IRS offices, and online at [https://www.irs.gov/privacy-disclosure/tax-code-regulations-and-official-guidance IRS.gov].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/publications/p590b| title=Publication 590-B (2020), Distributions from Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs) | publisher=Internal Revenue Service |series = Annuity distributions from an insurance company. | date = May 25, 2021 | accessdate=July 23, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group = "note"}} Refer to IRS Publications [https://www.irs.gov/publications/p590a 590-A] and [https://www.irs.gov/publications/p590b 590-B] for guidance.

You can use the money in your traditional IRA account to buy an annuity contract. You aren't taxed when you receive the annuity contract (unless the annuity contract is being converted to an annuity held by a Roth IRA). You are taxed when you start receiving payments under that annuity contract. See [https://www.irs.gov/publications/p590b IRS Publication 590-B] for tax calculations regarding deductible and non-deductible contributions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/publications/p590b| title=Publication 590-B (2020), Distributions from Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs) | publisher=Internal Revenue Service |series = Distribution of an annuity contract from your IRA account.| date = May 25, 2021 | accessdate=July 23, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other IRA terminology==

In addition, various terms are used to describe specific types of IRAs that fit into the above categories, but have special rules and specific legal implications. These terms include:

&lt;center&gt;
{| class="wikitable"
! style="width: 200px;"| Type of IRA
! style="width: 600px;"| Description
|-
|[[Inheriting an IRA|Inherited IRA]] || Inherited IRAs can be either Traditional or Roth, and Traditional IRAs inherit the basis of the original IRA. Inherited IRAs work like normal IRAs, but cannot be commingled with or rolled into other IRAs, cannot receive contributions from the new owner, and Traditional Inherited IRAs cannot be converted to a Roth IRA. Inherited IRAs have special distribution requirements; see: [[Required Minimum Distribution|Required Minimum Distribution]].
|-
|[[Stretch IRA]] || IRAs inherited prior to January 1, 2020 can be kept (and "stretched" out) over the heir's life expectancy, providing long-term tax-deferred or tax-free growth. [[Required_Minimum_Distribution|RMDs]] are required every year regardless of the heir's age, although they should be smaller than the rate of return of reasonable investments until the heir is well into their 70s, so the balance could continue to grow for decades. Following the passage of the SECURE Act, IRAs inherited after January 1, 2020 (with several exceptions for eligible designated beneficiaries -“EDB”&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.kitces.com/blog/secure-act-stretch-ira-401k-elimination-eligible-designated-beneficiary-retirement-accounts-taxes/ The (Partial) Death Of The Stretch IRA: How The SECURE Act Impacts Inherited Retirement Accounts], Michael Kitces, February 12, 2020.&lt;/ref&gt;) must be emptied by the end of the tenth year after being inherited. 
|-
|[[IRA_rollovers_and_transfers|Rollover IRA]] || A Rollover IRA is created when the account holder rolls over funds from a [[Qualified retirement plan|qualified retirement plan]] into an IRA, and they can be either Traditional or Roth. While Rollover IRAs generally work like normal IRAs, some [[Employer_retirement_plans_overview|employer plans]] limit incoming rollovers to Rollover IRAs and exclude Contributory IRAs, so contributing to a Rollover IRA could preclude a future rollover into these plans. Can also have legal consequences related to [[Asset protection|asset protection]].
|-
|Contributory IRA || A Contributory IRA is an IRA into which the account holder has directly contributed. Some [[Employer_retirement_plans_overview|employer plans]] prohibit incoming rollovers from Contributory IRAs. Can also have legal consequences related to [[Asset protection|asset protection]].
|-
|Spousal IRA || If you file a joint return, you may be able to contribute to an IRA even if you didn’t have taxable compensation as long as your spouse did. Each spouse can make a contribution up to the current limit; however, the total of your combined contributions can’t be more than the taxable compensation reported on your joint return. See the [https://www.irs.gov/publications/p590a Kay Bailey Hutchison Spousal IRA Limit] in Publication 590-A.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=September 22, 2022|title=Retirement Topics - IRA Contribution Limits|url=https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/plan-participant-employee/retirement-topics-ira-contribution-limits|access-date=October 11, 2022|website=Internal Revenue Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
|[[Non-deductible_traditional_IRA|Non-deductible IRA]] || A "Non-deductible Traditional IRA" or "Non-deductible IRA" is a Traditional IRA to which after-tax contributions have been made. Inherited, Contributory, and Spousal Traditional IRAs can all be non-deductible. The [[Traditional IRA]] page discusses the mechanics of basis tracking and withdrawals, and the [[Non-deductible_traditional_IRA|main page]] discusses suitability and performance of non-deductible IRAs.
|-
|Self-directed IRA or "Checkbook" IRA || Self-Directed IRAs can be either Traditional or Roth, and allow for a much wider range of investments than would normally be permitted in an IRA; see [[IRA#Allowable_investments|below]]. 
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

==Allowable investments==

IRAs available with most custodians allow a wide range of publicly-available investments, such as: [[Stock|stocks]], [[Bond|bonds]], [[Mutual fund|mutual funds]], savings accounts, [[Money markets|money market accounts]], [[Certificate of deposit|Certificates of Deposit (CDs)]], [[Treasury Inflation Protected Securities|Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS)]], and [[Real estate investment trust|Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs)]].

If you wish to purchase an annuity with money in your traditional IRA account, do a direct rollover to an Individual Retirement Annuity to avoid a taxable event.
Annuities funded with an IRA rollover are "qualified" plans, enabling an insurance company to create an "IRA annuity", into which you can deposit your retirement funds directly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.immediateannuities.com/roll-over-ira-or-401k/| title=Can I Buy An Annuity With My IRA or 401k? | publisher= ImmediateAnnuities.com |series = | date = June 21, 2021 | accessdate=July 23, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is typically done with an immediate annuity such as a [[Immediate fixed annuity|Single Premium Immediate Annuity (SPIA)]] in the distribution phase.{{#tag:ref | The tax benefits of acquiring a deferred [[Variable annuity|Variable Annuity]] with non-qualified money (taxes already paid) would be wasted inside an IRA because taxes are paid when withdrawn. You would be paying tax on this money twice. [https://www.annuity.org/annuities/taxation/qualified-vs-nonqualified/ Qualified vs. Non-Qualified Annuities], from Annuity.org, provides definitions and background information.| group = "note"}}

Some IRA custodians offer "Self-directed" or "Checkbook" IRAs that allow an even wider range of investments, including: IPO stock, privately-owned businesses, loans (mortgages, hard money loans, etc.), domestic or foreign real estate (including undeveloped land), private real estate funds or syndications, certain derivatives (including stock options), foreign currencies, tax liens, and others. These IRAs usually have additional fees to cover the higher management costs for these investments. 

===Prohibited investments and transactions===

Regardless of whether an IRA is self-directed, the following types of investments and transactions are prohibited:

* Collectibles (artwork, rugs, antiques, metals, gems, stamps, coins, alcoholic beverages, etc.), ''except'' for:
** 1 oz, ½ oz, ¼ oz, or 1/10 oz US gold coins
** 1 oz silver coins minted by the US Treasury Department
** Certain platinum coins
** Certain gold, silver, platinum, and palladium bullion
* Life insurance contracts
* Certain types of derivatives
* Self-dealing transactions involving yourself, your family, or your beneficiary, including:
** Loans to yourself or other disqualified persons
** Personally using property purchased with IRA funds, including real estate
** Acting as a property manager or performing maintenance on an IRA-owned rental property

==Required Minimum Distributions==
{{main|Required Minimum Distribution}}

Owners of Traditional, SEP, and SIMPLE IRAs must take distributions (called "Required Minimum Distributions") from their accounts, usually starting the year they turn 73. Owners of Roth IRAs are not required to take distributions.

Beneficiaries of IRAs are also required to take distributions.

See [[Required Minimum Distribution]] to learn more.

==Comparison to employer accounts==

[[Traditional IRA|Traditional]] and [[Roth IRA|Roth IRAs]] have many similarities with [[Employer retirement plans overview|employer retirement plans]]: contributions are either pre-tax (traditional) or Roth, growth is tax-deferred or tax-free, withdrawals before age 59½ are penalized unless exceptions apply, and are subject to RMDs (except the Roth IRA). However, IRAs are individually-controlled accounts, and employer plans are governed by the plan rules set by the employer and the provider, and they can have important differences. Many investors will face a choice between investing in an IRA and an employer plan, such as when not contributing enough to reach the limit in both accounts, and/or when separating from an employer and deciding whether to leave investments in the existing plan or roll it into an IRA. The following table lists the differences between IRAs, 401(k)s, and 403(b)s (the most common employer retirement account) that should help investors choose the best account given their own personal situation. This comparison is mostly independent of the choice between [[Traditional versus Roth]] tax structures, which is a complex topic discussed on its own wiki page. Other employer plans, such as the [[457(b)]], have important differences, and those differences are discussed on their respective plan pages.

! Income limits
|Deducting traditional IRA contributions has a low [[Traditional_IRA#Contribution_and_income_limits|income limit]] when you are covered by a retirement plan at work. The limit is higher for spouses not covered, and there is no limit if the single filer or both MFJ filers are not covered. Roth IRA contributions have a [[Roth_IRA#Contribution_eligibility_and_limits|higher limit]], and this limit can be circumvented by the [[Backdoor Roth|Backdoor Roth IRA process]].||Generally no income limits for 401(k) and 403(b) contributions, although there is a limit on the compensation that can be used for matching calculations ($360,000 as of 2026&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-25-67.pdf|title=Notice 2025-67|publisher=IRS|accessdate=27 November 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;)||Employer plan

Plans that allow [[After-tax 401(k)|after-tax]] contributions and either in-plan Roth rollovers or in-service distributions can be used to make [[mega-backdoor Roth]] contributions up to the Section 415 limit ($72,000 for 2026).||Depends on the employer plan and the investor's income.
|-
! [[Roth IRA conversion|Roth conversions]]
|Traditional IRAs always allow Roth conversions to a Roth IRA.||Roth conversions are only possible from an employer plan while the employee is working if the plan offers either In-Service Withdrawals (which allow rollover to a Roth IRA), or a Roth sub account and in-plan Roth rollovers. Investors can always roll money out of an employer plan (into a traditional or Roth IRA) when they separate from their employer, which is a more common situation for wanting to do Roth conversions.||Although not common, employees who may want Roth conversions while working should keep some pre-tax money in a traditional IRA if their employer plan does not allow Roth conversions.     
|-
! Employer contributions and matching
|IRAs are individual accounts, and have no matching with the exception of a SIMPLE IRA.||Some employer plans offer employer matching contributions, usually 50% or 100% up to some limit. Solo 401(k)s allow large employer contributions, which effectively raises the contribution limit for the self-employed. ||Employer plan, if matching is offered. Getting an employer match should be a top [[Prioritizing investments|financial priority]].
|-
! Investment choices
|IRAs allow a wide range of [[IRA#Allowable_investments|investments]], and this can be expanded further with a Self-directed IRA.||Employer plans only allow a set of investments offered by the plan, which may be undesirable. Some plans have a [[Self directed brokerage account|brokerage option]] allowing trading of stocks and ETFs, and occasionally a plan will have unusual investments (a [[Stable value fund|stable value fund]], annuities, real estate funds, etc.) that could be uniquely valuable to certain investors. For the self-employed, [[Solo 401(k) plan|Solo 401(k)s]] are available at no cost and with a similarly wide range of investment choices as an IRA, and Self-directed Solo 401(k)s are available that are similar to Self-directed IRAs.||IRA when compared to most employer plans, and a tie compared to a Solo 401(k). Exceptions exist.
|-
! Unrelated Business Income Tax (UBIT)
|IRAs are only tax-deferred or tax-free for passive investments. If a (usually self-directed) IRA invests in an active business that does not pay corporate taxes, such as an LLC, partnership, or S-corporation, the IRA must pay UBIT on the active income. UBIT also applies to house-flipping, which is considered active income. IRAs must also pay UBIT on Unrelated Debt Financed Income (UDFI), income on a debt-financed investment (for example, rental property) inside an IRA. UBIT receives a $1,000 standard deduction and is paid by the IRA according to the trust tax brackets.  ||Self-directed Solo 401(k)s are subject to the same UBIT rules as IRAs. However, they are not subject to Unrelated Debt Financed Income (UDFI) on leveraged real estate investments.||Investors looking to invest in leveraged real estate should prefer a self-directed Solo 401(k) to a self-directed IRA
|-
! Fees
|IRAs are available from many custodians for no cost and only the expenses within investments (~0.1% per year or less). ||Employer plans can have much higher fees (~1-2%+ per year) than IRAs. However, employer plan fees have come down on average in recent decades, and many are competitive with IRAs. Some plans offer "institutional class" or other funds with even lower expenses than similar funds in a retail IRA.||Usually the IRA, although exceptional employer plans are slightly better than IRAs.

! Compatibility with [[Backdoor Roth|Backdoor Roth IRA]]
|Pre-tax traditional (along with [[SEP]] and [[SIMPLE IRA|SIMPLE]]) IRA balances interfere with the Backdoor Roth IRA||401(k) and 403(b) balances do not interfere with the Backdoor Roth IRA.||Major advantage to the employer plan for pre-tax money for those wishing to make Backdoor Roth IRA contributions.
|-
! [[Early withdrawal|Early distribution]] (before age 59½) options
| Exceptions to the age 59½ rule: disability, education expenses, [[Substantially equal periodic payments|SEPP]], first-time homebuyers (up to $10,000), IRS levy, medical expenses, unemployed health insurance premiums, and others.&lt;ref name="early distributions"&gt;[https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/plan-participant-employee/retirement-topics-tax-on-early-distributions Tax on early distributions], IRS&lt;/ref&gt; Roth IRAs also allow withdrawal of contributions at any time without penalty, which allows [[Roth IRA as an emergency fund|great flexibility]]. ||Exceptions to the age 59½ rule: disability, [[Substantially equal periodic payments|SEPP]], IRS levy, medical expenses, [[Rule of 55|separation from service age 55 or older]], and others.&lt;ref name="early distributions"/&gt; Plans may offer hardship withdrawals and/or in-service withdrawals, but whether these withdrawals incur penalties is subject to IRS rules. Some plans also allow loans to the participant. Employer plans are allowed to involuntarily roll small ($1,000-7,000) balances into an IRA upon separation, and cash out very small (&lt;$1,000) balances, possibly generating taxes and penalties unless the owner takes positive steps to roll the balance into an IRA. || The Roth IRA has a major advantage over all other retirement accounts. Rule of 55 is an advantage for those retiring in or after the year they turn 55. Otherwise, close to a tie; it depends on the plan options and the situation.
|-
! [[Asset protection|Asset protection]]&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Asset protection is a complex legal subject that is further complicated due to many laws being state-specific. The information presented here is only high-level, and as noted on the [[Asset protection|wiki page]], legal ambiguity exists in some areas. For asset protection legal advice, consult a competent asset protection attorney in your state.&lt;/ref&gt;
|IRAs receive state-level protection from civil judgments, which [https://www.thetaxadviser.com/content/dam/tta/issues/2014/jan/stateirachart.pdf varies widely by state]. Traditional and Roth IRAs are exempt from federal bankruptcy up to $1.0M, and SEP and SIMPLE IRAs receive unlimited exemption. Can be divided in a "transfer incident to a divorce."||ERISA 401(k) and 403(b) plans are protected from civil judgments and bankruptcy at the federal level. Solo 401(k)s are generally not ERISA plans, and receive state-level protection similar to IRAs. Can be accessed by a [[Asset_protection#Qualified_domestic_relations_order_(QDRO)|Qualified Domestic Relations Order (QDRO)]]. ''(Not all 403(b)s are ERISA plans.)''|| [https://www.thetaxadviser.com/content/dam/tta/issues/2014/jan/stateirachart.pdf Highly dependent on the state]. ERISA employer plans may have an advantage over IRAs. Solo 401(k)s are about equal to IRAs.
|-
! [[Required Minimum Distribution|Required Minimum Distribution]]
|Traditional IRAs, SEP-IRAs, and SIMPLE-IRAs generally require RMDs starting at age 75. Roth IRAs have no RMDs. ||Traditional 401(k)s and 403(b)s require RMDs at age 73, but they are waived if you are still working&lt;ref group="note"&gt;See [[Required Minimum Distribution]] for exceptions if you are an owner of the business.&lt;/ref&gt;. Roth 401(k)s and 403(b)s have no RMDs. Traditional Solo 401(k)s start RMDs at age 75 regardless of whether you're still working. ||Traditional employer plans have an advantage for those working after age 75 and looking to avoid RMDs. Otherwise, close to a tie. 
|-
! Inheritance
|When inheriting an IRA, spouses generally have the option to (1) treat the IRA as their own, (2) roll the IRA into their own IRA or into an employer plan, (3) treat the IRA as an [[Inheriting an IRA|Inherited IRA]], (4) cash out the IRA with whatever tax liability results, or (5) disclaim the IRA and let it pass to the contingent beneficiary. Non-spouses must treat the IRA as an inherited IRA, which has [[Required_Minimum_Distribution|distribution requirements]].||Spouses generally have the same options as they would inheriting an IRA. Some employer plans allow beneficiaries to [[401(k)#Beneficiaries|leave the balance in the plan]], and take RMDs like an IRA. Otherwise, the balance is rolled out into the appropriate type of inherited IRA.||Tie

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' contains supporting analysis and formula derivations for retirement plan-related articles, including [[Traditional versus Roth]] and [[Roth IRA conversion|Roth conversion]].

{{Notice|This article is intended for ''math enthusiasts'' who want to understand the underlying details. Investors without a math background can safely skip this information.}}

==Relative value of contributions and conversions==
{{Main|Roth IRA conversion#Whether to convert}}

Define variables:
:&lt;math&gt;R = \text{Roth balance}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;T = \text{Traditional balance}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;C = \text{Roth-converted amount}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;V = \text{Total value of tax-advantaged space}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;A = \text{After-tax amount}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;MTR_n = \text{marginal tax rate now}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;MTR_w = \text{marginal tax rate at withdrawal}&lt;/math&gt;

The overall value of a change to tax-advantaged space is equal to:

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta V = \Delta T (1 - MTR_w) + \Delta R&lt;/math&gt;

Consider a given after-tax investment &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; that can be contributed to a traditional account, a Roth account, or used to pay the taxes on a Roth conversion. When making a traditional contribution, the change in traditional balance is:

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta T = \frac{A}{(1 - MTR_n)}&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, the change in value when making a traditional contribution is:

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta V_T = A \frac{(1 - MTR_w)}{(1 - MTR_n)}&lt;/math&gt;

When making a Roth ''contribution'', the change in Roth balance is simply:

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta R = A&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, the change in value when making a Roth contribution is:

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta V_R = A&lt;/math&gt;

When making a Roth ''conversion'', the converted amount is:

:&lt;math&gt;C = \frac{A}{MTR_n}&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, the change in value when making a Roth conversion is:

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta V_C = C - C(1 - MTR_w) = \frac{A}{MTR_n} - \frac{A}{MTR_n} \cdot (1 - MTR_w) = \frac{A}{MTR_n}(1 - (1 - MTR_w)) = A \frac{MTR_w}{MTR_n}&lt;/math&gt;

When &lt;math&gt;MTR_n &lt; MTR_w&lt;/math&gt; (current marginal tax rate is ''less than'' predicted future marginal tax rate),

:&lt;math&gt; \Delta V_C &gt; \Delta V_R &gt; \Delta V_T &lt;/math&gt;

When &lt;math&gt;MTR_n = MTR_w&lt;/math&gt; (current marginal tax rate ''equals'' predicted future marginal tax rate),

:&lt;math&gt; \Delta V_C = \Delta V_R = \Delta V_T &lt;/math&gt;

When &lt;math&gt;MTR_n &gt; MTR_w&lt;/math&gt; (current marginal tax rate is ''greater than'' predicted future marginal tax rate),

:&lt;math&gt; \Delta V_C &lt; \Delta V_R &lt; \Delta V_T &lt;/math&gt;

==Saver's Credit==
{{Main|Traditional versus Roth#Saver's credit}}

Define variables:
:&lt;math&gt;MTR_{n, T} = \text{marginal tax rate now, for the traditional contribution, including Saver's Credit}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;MTR_{n, R} = \text{marginal rate now of Saver's Credit for the Roth contribution}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;MTR_w = \text{marginal tax rate for traditional contributions at withdrawal}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;T = \text{traditional contribution}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;R = \text{Roth contribution}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;A = \text{after-tax cost of making retirement contributions (traditional or Roth)}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;G = \text{growth factor of investments between now and withdrawal}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;V = \text{after-tax value of retirement accounts}&lt;/math&gt;

For a fair comparison, the two take home pays must be equal:

:&lt;math&gt;A = T \cdot (1 - MTR_{n,T}) = R \cdot (1 - MTR_{n,R})&lt;/math&gt;

Solving for T and R in terms of A:

:&lt;math&gt;T = \frac{A}{1 - MTR_{n,T}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;R = \frac{A}{1 - MTR_{n,R}}&lt;/math&gt;

The after-tax value of retirement accounts for the two contribution options are:

:&lt;math&gt;V_T = \frac{A}{1 - MTR_{n,T}} \cdot G \cdot (1 - MTR_w)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;V_R = \frac{A}{1 - MTR_{n,R}} \cdot G&lt;/math&gt;

Traditional contributions are preferred when the &lt;math&gt;V_T &gt; V_R&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{A}{1 - MTR_{n,T}} \cdot G \cdot (1 - MTR_w) &gt; \frac{A}{1 - MTR_{n,R}} \cdot G&lt;/math&gt;

Canceling &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; (assumed to be the same in both cases), and solving for &lt;math&gt;MTR_w&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1 - MTR_w}{1 - MTR_{n,T}} &gt; \frac{1}{1 - MTR_{n,R}}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;MTR_w &lt; 1 - \frac{1 - MTR_{n,T}}{1 - MTR_{n,R}}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;MTR_w &lt; \frac{MTR_{n,T} - MTR_{n,R}}{1 - MTR_{n,R}}&lt;/math&gt;

==Maxing out retirement accounts==
{{Main|Traditional versus Roth#Maxing out your retirement accounts}}

Define variables as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;MTR_n = \text{marginal tax rate now, for traditional contribution}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;MTR_w = \text{marginal tax rate for traditional contributions at withdrawal}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;MTR_{div} = \text{marginal tax rate on dividends}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;MTR_{w,cg} = \text{marginal tax rate on capital gains at withdrawal}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;C = \text {contribution (fixed dollar amount for traditional or Roth)}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;G_T = \text {growth factor on traditional balance, before taxes}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;G_R = \text {growth factor on Roth balance (tax-free)}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;G_{Tx} = \text {growth factor on taxable balance, after taxes}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;r_T = \text{total rate of return on the traditional balance}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;r_R = \text{total rate of return on the Roth balance}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;r_{Tx} = \text{total rate of return on the taxable balance}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;y = \text{yield on the taxable balance}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;v = \text{ratio of taxable balance to original balance}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;b = \text{ratio of taxable basis to original balance}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;t = \text{time}&lt;/math&gt;

When contributing a fixed dollar amount &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; to either traditional or Roth accounts, investing the tax difference &lt;math&gt;C \cdot MTR_n&lt;/math&gt; in a taxable account, traditional contributions are preferred when:

:&lt;math&gt;C \cdot G_T \cdot (1 - MTR_w) + MTR_n \cdot C \cdot G_{Tx} &gt; C \cdot G_R&lt;/math&gt;

Canceling &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; and solving for &lt;math&gt;MTR_w&lt;/math&gt; gives:

:&lt;math&gt;MTR_w &lt; \frac{MTR_n \cdot G_{Tx}}{G_T} - \frac{G_R}{G_T} + 1&lt;/math&gt; 

Rather than plug in the formulas for these factors to create one large equation, it is easier to calculate each factor separately. Assuming annual compounding, the three growth factors can be calculated as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;G_T = (1 + r_T)^t&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;G_R = (1 + r_R)^t&lt;/math&gt;

Taking the equations [[Taxable_account#Performance|taxable account performance]] and normalizing to &lt;math&gt;V(0)&lt;/math&gt; gives:

:&lt;math&gt;v = \frac{V(t)}{V(0)} = (1 + r_{Tx} - y \cdot MTR_{div})^t&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;b = \frac{B(t)}{V(0)} = 1 + \left ( \frac{ y \cdot (1-MTR_{div})}{r_{Tx} - y \cdot MTR_{div}} \right ) \cdot (v - 1)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;G_{Tx} = v - (v - b) \cdot MTR_{w,cg}&lt;/math&gt;

Separate rates of return for traditional, Roth, and taxable accounts allow the comparison between different accounts (for example, IRA or 401(k)) with different investments and fees. Assuming the same investments and fees (&lt;math&gt;r_T = r_R = r_{Tx} = r&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;G_T = G_R&lt;/math&gt;), the equations simplifies somewhat to:

:&lt;math&gt;MTR_w &lt; MTR_n \cdot \frac{v - (v - b) \cdot MTR_{w,cg}}{(1 + r)^t}&lt;/math&gt; 

This formula was originally derived by forum member ''FiveK'' in a [https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&amp;t=150516#p2773840 forum post].

===Selling appreciated investments===

Define additional variables as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;MTR_{n,cg} = \text{marginal tax rate now, on capital gains}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;f_b = \text{basis fraction of taxable investments sold now}&lt;/math&gt;

If an investor wants to contribute the maximum, but does not have enough cash flow or cash savings to cover the tax cost, appreciated [[Taxable account|taxable]] investments may be sold to generate the cash. Based on the equation above, the net proceeds of the investment sale must be worth &lt;math&gt;C \cdot MTR_n&lt;/math&gt; after taxes. A sold taxable investment will only be worth &lt;math&gt;1-MTR_{n,cg}(1-f_b)&lt;/math&gt; times the nominal value, so with this added assumption, traditional contributions are preferred when:

:&lt;math&gt;C \cdot G_T \cdot (1 - MTR_w) + \frac{MTR_n \cdot C}{1-MTR_{n,cg}(1-f_b)} \cdot G_{Tx} &gt; C \cdot G_R&lt;/math&gt;

Canceling &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; and solving for &lt;math&gt;MTR_w&lt;/math&gt; gives:

:&lt;math&gt;MTR_w &lt; \frac{MTR_n}{1-MTR_{n,cg}(1-f_b)} \cdot \frac{G_{Tx}}{G_T} - \frac{G_R}{G_T} + 1&lt;/math&gt; 

The growth factors are the same as above, except that the basis must be adjusted:

:&lt;math&gt;b = \frac{B(t)}{V(0)} = f_b + \left ( \frac{ y \cdot (1-MTR_{div})}{r_{Tx} - y \cdot MTR_{div}} \right ) \cdot (v - 1)&lt;/math&gt;

Assuming the same investments and fees (&lt;math&gt;r_T = r_R = r_{Tx} = r&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;G_T = G_R&lt;/math&gt;), the equations simplifies somewhat to:

:&lt;math&gt;MTR_w &lt; \frac{MTR_n}{1-MTR_{n,cg}(1-f_b)} \cdot \frac{v - (v - b) \cdot MTR_{w,cg}}{(1 + r)^t}&lt;/math&gt;

==Employer match==
{{Main|Traditional versus Roth#Employer match}}

Define variables as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;MTR_n = \text{marginal tax rate now, for traditional contribution}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;MTR_w = \text{marginal tax rate for traditional contributions at withdrawal}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;m = \text {employer match rate}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;T = \text{traditional balance}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;R = \text{Roth balance}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;A = \text{after-tax cost of making retirement contributions (traditional or Roth)}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;G = \text{growth factor of investments between now and withdrawal}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;V = \text{after-tax value of retirement accounts}&lt;/math&gt;

When making a traditional contribution, the changes in the two types of balances will be:

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta T_T = \frac{A}{1 - MTR_n} \cdot (1 + m)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta R_T = 0&lt;/math&gt;

When making a Roth contribution, the changes in the two types of balances will be:

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta T_R = A \cdot m&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta R_R = A&lt;/math&gt;

The after-tax values at withdrawal of the two contribution choices are:

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta V_T = \frac{A}{1 - MTR_n} \cdot (1 + m) \cdot G \cdot (1 - MTR_w)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta V_R = A \cdot m \cdot G \cdot (1 - MTR_w) + A \cdot G&lt;/math&gt;

Traditional contributions are preferred when &lt;math&gt;\Delta V_T &gt; \Delta V_R&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{A}{1 - MTR_n} \cdot (1 + m) \cdot G \cdot (1 - MTR_w) &gt; A \cdot m \cdot G \cdot (1 - MTR_w) + A \cdot G&lt;/math&gt;

Canceling &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; (assumed to be the same in both cases):

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1 - MTR_w}{1 - MTR_n} \cdot (1 + m) &gt; m \cdot (1 - MTR_w) + 1 &lt;/math&gt;

Solving for &lt;math&gt;MTR_w&lt;/math&gt; using a Computer Algebra System (CAS):

:&lt;math&gt;MTR_w &lt; \frac{(1+m) \cdot MTR_n}{m \cdot MTR_n + 1}&lt;/math&gt;

===Employer match combined with Saver's Credit===

The above equations can be modified to also include a Saver's Credit. When making a traditional contribution, the changes in the two types of balances will be:

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta T_T = \frac{A}{1 - MTR_{n,T}} \cdot (1 + m)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta R_T = 0&lt;/math&gt;

When making a Roth contribution, the changes in the two types of balances will be:

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta T_R = \frac{A}{1 - MTR_{n,R}} \cdot m&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta R_R = \frac{A}{1 - MTR_{n,R}}&lt;/math&gt;

The after-tax values at withdrawal of the two contribution choices are:

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta V_T = \frac{A}{1 - MTR_n} \cdot (1 + m) \cdot G \cdot (1 - MTR_w)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta V_R = A \cdot m \cdot G \cdot (1 - MTR_w) + A \cdot G&lt;/math&gt;

Traditional contributions are preferred when &lt;math&gt;\Delta V_T &gt; \Delta V_R&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{A}{1 - MTR_{n,T}} \cdot (1 + m) \cdot G \cdot (1 - MTR_w) &gt; \frac{A}{1 - MTR_{n,R}} \cdot m \cdot G \cdot (1 - MTR_w) + \frac{A}{1 - MTR_{n,R}} \cdot G&lt;/math&gt;

Canceling &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; (assumed to be the same in both cases):

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1 - MTR_w}{1 - MTR_{n,T}} \cdot (1 + m) &gt; \frac{m \cdot (1 - MTR_w) + 1}{1 - MTR_{n,R}} &lt;/math&gt;

Solving for &lt;math&gt;MTR_w&lt;/math&gt; using a Computer Algebra System (CAS):

:&lt;math&gt;MTR_w &lt; \frac{(1+m) \cdot (MTR_{n,T} - MTR_{n,R})}{m \cdot (MTR_{n,T} - MTR_{n,R}) +1 - MTR_{n,R}}&lt;/math&gt;

==Conversions on estates subject to estate tax==
{{Main|Traditional versus Roth#Estate planning}}

Define variables:
:&lt;math&gt;R = \text{Roth balance}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;T = \text{Traditional balance}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;A = \text{After-tax balance}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;C = \text{Roth-converted amount}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;V_h = \text{Total value of estate to heirs after-tax}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;MTR_n = \text{marginal tax rate now}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;MTR_e = \text{marginal tax rate on estate}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;MTR_h = \text{marginal tax rate on heirs}&lt;/math&gt;

When a Roth conversion is performed on assets, during the owner's life on assets expected to be subject to estate tax, and the taxes can be paid from after-tax assets, the net effect on types of assets are as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta T = -C&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta R = +C&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta A = -C \cdot MTR_n \cdot (1 - MTR_e)&lt;/math&gt;

The change in after-tax value of the estate to heirs will be as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta V_h = \Delta T \cdot (1 - MTR_h) + \Delta R + \Delta A = -C \cdot (1 - MTR_h) + C - C \cdot MTR_n \cdot (1 - MTR_e)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta V_h = C \cdot ((MTR_h - 1) + 1 + MTR_n \cdot (MTR_e - 1)) = C \cdot (MTR_h + MTR_n \cdot (MTR_e - 1))&lt;/math&gt;

It follows that Roth conversions increase the value of the after-tax value of the estate if:

:&lt;math&gt;MTR_h + MTR_n \cdot (MTR_e - 1) &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt;MTR_h &gt; MTR_n \cdot (1 - MTR_e)&lt;/math&gt;

==Effective interest rate of retirement plan loans==

Define variables:
:&lt;math&gt;R = \text{retirement plan balance (pre-tax)}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;RL = \text{retirement plan loan balance}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;L = \text{regular loan balance}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;P = \text{payment amount}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;r_R = \text{expected rate of return for retirement plan investments}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;r_{RL} = \text{interest rate on retirement plan loan}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;r_L = \text{interest rate on regular loan}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;G_R = \text{growth factor on retirement plan investments}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;G_{RL} = \text{growth factor on retirement plan loan}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;G_L = \text{growth factor on regular loan}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\tau_R = \text{marginal tax rate on future retirement plan withdrawals}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;t = \text{time}&lt;/math&gt;

Assume the investor has both a retirement plan loan with balance &lt;math&gt;RL&lt;/math&gt; with interest rate &lt;math&gt;r_{RL}&lt;/math&gt;, and a regular loan with balance &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; with an interest rate &lt;math&gt;r_L&lt;/math&gt;, the interest on which is not tax-deductible. The retirement plan has a starting balance &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, net of the loan, and the investments within the plan are expected to grow at a rate of &lt;math&gt;r_R&lt;/math&gt;.

The investor has a lump-sum payment &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; available, which can either be applied to the regular loan, or the retirement plan loan. If applied to the regular loan, the retirement plan loan and balance remain &lt;math&gt;RL&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; respectively, and the regular loan balance becomes &lt;math&gt;L-P&lt;/math&gt;. If applied to the retirement plan loan, the retirement loan balance becomes &lt;math&gt;RL-P&lt;/math&gt;, the retirement plan balance becomes &lt;math&gt;R+P&lt;/math&gt;, and the regular loan balance remains &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;. 

In either case, assume no additional payments are made, and the balances grow at their respective rates until time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, when the retirement loan becomes due and the outstanding balance is paid back into the plan. The better choice of payment will be the one that has the higher future value, net of loan repayments and taxes on the retirement plan withdrawals, which will be at a rate &lt;math&gt;\tau_R&lt;/math&gt;. 

To simplify, define the growth factors on the three balances as:

:&lt;math&gt;G_R = (1 + r_R)^t&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;G_{RL} = (1 + r_{RL})^t&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;G_L = (1 + r_L)^t&lt;/math&gt;

The future value of the regular loan repayment option will be:

:&lt;math&gt;[ R \cdot G_R + RL \cdot G_{RL} ] \cdot (1 - \tau_R) - RL \cdot G_{RL} - (L - P) \cdot G_L&lt;/math&gt;

The future value of the retirement loan repayment option will be:

:&lt;math&gt;[ (R + P) \cdot G_R + (RL - P) \cdot G_{RL} ] \cdot (1 - \tau_R) - (RL - P) \cdot G_{RL} - L \cdot G_L&lt;/math&gt;

To find the effective interest rate of the retirement plan loan, we can set these two values equal to each other, and find the interest rate of a regular loan (whether the investor actually has one or not) that would give the same future value as a retirement loan payment.

Expanding the regular loan payment option:

:&lt;math&gt;[ R \cdot G_R + RL \cdot G_{RL} ] \cdot (1 - \tau_R) - RL \cdot G_{RL} - L \cdot G_L + P \cdot G_L&lt;/math&gt;

Expanding the retirement loan payment option:

:&lt;math&gt;[ R \cdot G_R + P \cdot G_R + RL \cdot G_{RL} - P \cdot G_{RL} ] \cdot (1 - \tau_R) - RL \cdot G_{RL} + P \cdot G_{RL} - L \cdot G_L&lt;/math&gt;

Canceling terms that appear on both sides:

:&lt;math&gt;P \cdot G_L = [P \cdot G_R - P \cdot G_{RL} ] \cdot (1 - \tau_R) + P \cdot G_{RL}&lt;/math&gt;

Canceling &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, as it appears in all terms, and setting &lt;math&gt;G_{eff} = G_L&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;G_{eff} = G_{RL} + [G_R - G_{RL} ] \cdot (1 - \tau_R) &lt;/math&gt;

Finally, the effective after-tax rate of return is:

:&lt;math&gt;r_{eff} = {G_{eff}}^{(\frac{1}{t})} - 1&lt;/math&gt;

Note that for tax rate values &lt;math&gt;0&lt;=\tau_R&lt;1&lt;/math&gt;, the effective interest rate is &lt;math&gt;r_{RL}&lt;r_{eff}&lt;=r_R&lt;/math&gt;, but the result is non-linear (that is, a 50% tax rate does not give an effective interest rate halfway between &lt;math&gt;r_{RL}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;r_R&lt;/math&gt;.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' refers to the common investment decision of whether to use '''traditional''' (pre-tax) or '''Roth''' accounts. You must make this decision when your employer offers both a traditional and [[401(k)#Roth 401(k)| Roth 401(k)]], or when you can deduct a [[traditional IRA]] contribution or use a [[Roth IRA]], or when you consider leaving money in a traditional account or [[Roth IRA conversion|converting some to Roth]].

The better option is the one that gives you (or your heirs, if you are [[#Estate_planning|estate planning]]) more spendable income after all taxes are paid. Preference for one account type or the other is fundamentally a [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tax-planning.asp tax planning] question.

In a traditional retirement account such as a deductible [[traditional IRA]] or traditional [[401(k)]], your contributions are deductible - no tax is paid on account growth while the money remains in the account, and withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.

In a Roth retirement account such as a [[Roth IRA]] or [[401(k)#Roth 401(k)| Roth 401(k)]], your contributions are not deductible, but all future growth and withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p590b.pdf IRS Publication 590-B: Distributions from IRAs]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irs.gov/Retirement-Plans/Roth-Comparison-Chart IRS Roth Comparison Chart]&lt;/ref&gt;

The approach that incurs a lower [[marginal tax rate]] will, in most cases, provide you more spendable income. Neither is inherently better, as either one may be a better choice in different situations. Here are some of the considerations.

==General guidelines==

See [[Prioritizing investments]] for general investment considerations.

The decision between deductible traditional vs. Roth contributions hinges primarily on a comparison between your [[#Calculating_marginal_tax_rate_now|known marginal tax rate now]] vs. an [[#Estimating_future_marginal_tax_rate|estimated marginal tax rate at withdrawal]]. As discussed in more detail below, [[#Estimating_future_marginal_tax_rate|estimating future marginal tax rates]] relies on a lot of assumptions and tax brackets and rules can change at any time.

Assuming you have an estimate for your future marginal tax rate, prefer traditional when your current marginal rate is higher than that estimate, and prefer Roth when your current marginal rate is lower than the estimate.

Those who choose not to estimate future tax rates are left with various rules of thumb for guidance. Because these rules of thumb have many exceptions, a personalized future estimate is recommended, but in lieu of that consider:
*Contributing 100% traditional, because it is the best choice for [[#Results|most people most of the time]]
*Contributing 50% traditional and 50% Roth, because a mix adds [[#Tax_diversification|tax diversification]] and you cannot be more than 50% wrong
*Contributing according to [[Traditional_versus_Roth_examples#Some_rules_of_thumb|some rules of thumb]] that might be applicable, although most of them still require some assumption about future tax rates.

For those reluctant to contribute at all, either traditional or Roth, or any mix, is almost always a better choice than saving outside retirement accounts. In addition to providing more future income after taxes, traditional and Roth accounts also offer other benefits such as [[Asset protection|asset protection]] and [[Estate planning|estate planning]].

Whatever you choose for any one year, you may make a different choice in subsequent years.

===Eligibility===

Not all investors will be able to choose between traditional and Roth options in all their accounts.

[[Employer retirement plans overview|Employer-sponsored accounts]] ([[401(k)]], [[403(b)]], [[457(b)]]) always offer a traditional option, but may or may not offer a Roth option. However, there are no income limitations on contributions, as there are for IRAs.

With [[IRA|IRAs]], the eligibility of traditional vs. Roth is affected by income. There is an [[Traditional_IRA#Contribution_and_income_limits|income limit]] for ''deducting contributions'' to a traditional IRA. Above that limit, and below the [[Roth_IRA#Contribution_Eligibility_and_Limits|Roth IRA contribution income limit]], a Roth IRA is best. Above the Roth IRA income contribution limit, you may choose either the [[Backdoor Roth|backdoor Roth IRA contribution process]], a [[Non-deductible traditional IRA]], or a [[Taxable account|taxable account]]- see those pages for more details.

See also: [[IRA#Comparison_to_employer_accounts|Comparison between IRAs and employer plans]].

===Common misconceptions===

There are two common misconceptions, one that incorrectly favors traditional, and one that incorrectly favors Roth.

The first misconception is sometimes described as "contributions are taken from the top tax rate and are withdrawn later at the average rate". In other words, that you save a marginal rate when contributing but pay only an average rate (starting at 0% for the first dollar withdrawn) when withdrawing. Following is an example of why that is not true.

Consider a 50 year old who has already accumulated a $500,000 traditional balance. Even without any further contributions, that could reasonably double to $1&amp;nbsp;million by age 65. Taking a 4% per year withdrawal then gives $40,000 per year. Any traditional contributions at age 51 (or later) will increase the traditional balance at age 65, thus allowing more than $40,000 per year withdrawal. The taxation on the amount above $40,000 per year will occur at the marginal rate on that amount, not the effective rate on the total income.

The second misconception is that "it is better to pay tax on the seed than the harvest." In other words, that it is better to pay a lesser tax amount now to make a Roth contribution, instead of a larger amount of tax later on a traditional withdrawal. This is not true because taking a percentage of the "seed" is the same as letting the full seed grow and then taking the same percentage of the "harvest." The result will be the same in either case.

The goal should ''not'' be to pay as little tax as possible. Instead, the goal should be to have as much money leftover after taxes as possible. Comparing marginal rates between contribution (or conversion now) and withdrawal in the future is the most direct way to achieve this goal.

==Calculations==
The main reason to prefer one type of account over the other is the difference between current vs. future [[marginal tax rate]]s.

===Simplest situation===
For the same pre-tax contribution amount and growth, the after-tax value is entirely determined by the marginal tax rate on contributions and withdrawals. This also applies to "now vs. later" Roth conversions when the tax is paid from converted funds. For Roth conversions, in the discussion below read "traditional" as "convert later" and "Roth" as "convert now".

You can calculate the amount you get after taxes as:
:&lt;math&gt;traditional = Original\ amount \times Growth\ factor \times (1 - withdrawal\ tax\ rate)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;Roth = Original\ amount \times (1 - contribution\ tax\ rate) \times Growth\ factor&lt;/math&gt;

The "Growth factor" can be calculated as &lt;math&gt;(1 + r)^t&lt;/math&gt;, where ''r'' is the annual rate of return and ''t'' is the time in years. Because you may choose identical investments in both traditional and Roth accounts, the "Growth factor" is the same for each.

If the marginal tax rate now (the "contribution tax rate") is higher than the marginal tax rate later (the "withdrawal tax rate"), then the traditional account is better; if it is lower, then the Roth account is better. For the Roth conversion decision, "traditional account is better" means "do not convert" and "Roth account is better" means "do convert".

When the withdrawal marginal tax rate will be the same as the marginal tax rate saved by a traditional contribution), thanks to the commutative property of multiplication (that is, &lt;math&gt;A \times B \times C = A \times C \times B&lt;/math&gt;) the traditional and Roth results are equal.

===More complicated situations===
The simple analysis above is valid for many situations, but it does make assumptions that are not applicable in other situations. Those other situations include
===="Traditional plus taxable" vs. Roth====
For an apples-to-apples comparison, you must sometimes compare Roth accounts against a combination of traditional and taxable accounts. This situation occurs in three different ways:&lt;ref group=note&gt;Different results occur if you compare a Roth contribution against the same traditional contribution and ignores the tax cost (and thus lower spendable income) in the contribution year. This may be considered a form of enforced savings and simply by virtue of “saving more” will favor Roth but is not the same thing as the apples-to-apples comparison discussed in this article.&lt;/ref&gt;
:a) Contributing more to a Roth than the after-tax amount of the maximum traditional contribution, for example, when contributing the [[#Maxing_out_your_retirement_accounts|maximum to retirement accounts]].
:b) Doing a [[Roth_IRA_conversion|Roth conversion]] and paying the conversion tax from cash on hand (as opposed to paying the tax from the conversion amount).
:c) Doing a Roth conversion to reduce required minimum distributions (RMDs) when the RMDs will be invested in a taxable account instead of spent.
In these situations, tax drag in the taxable account may make Roth preferable even if the withdrawal tax rate is somewhat below the contribution tax rate. Examples of "somewhat" are shown in a [[#Typical_values|table below]] for situations a) and b), and there are two spreadsheets that will calculate "somewhat" for specific circumstances in those situations:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&amp;t=150516#p2773840 Roth 401(k) vs. 401(k) Spreadsheet Attempt]&lt;/ref&gt;

:* [https://docs.zoho.com/sheet/published.do?rid=hd3vbee16c938134d45b1bd758e37d6fddfc7 Traditional versus Roth (401(k) or IRA)]

Situation c) is even more complicated because, unlike for a) and b), a single equation for that situation has not been derived and a year-by-year spreadsheet approach is the best available. Two spreadsheets that have been published for this use are

====Niche situations====
If you are in either of the situations below, follow the links for details and simple calculations.
* Investors who are not able to get the [[#Employer match|maximum employer match]]
* Investors eligible for the [[Saver's credit]] on both traditional and Roth contributions

Regardless of whether you have a simple or more complicated situation, you generally need values for both current and future marginal rates to make a reasoned choice. How to get those values comes next.

There is one notable shortcut: If you can contribute to Roth accounts today at 12% or less, it is usually a good idea as this is a historically low tax rate - especially if you are far from retirement. Many things can change that could cause you to pay a higher rate at withdrawal; such as [[#Tax risk|changes in tax law]], moving to a [[State income taxes|higher-tax state]], unexpected increases in income, [[Stretch IRA|inheriting an IRA]], among others. Only defer taxes at 12% or less if you are close to withdrawal and are very confident you will be able to withdraw at a lower rate.

==Calculating marginal tax rate now==

Your marginal tax rate now is relatively easy to determine. It is not necessarily your tax bracket, because of phase-ins and phase-outs of tax benefits (for example, [[Traditional_versus_Roth_examples#Business_tax_considerations|business tax considerations]], various credits, [[Taxation of Social Security benefits]]), and tax-like costs (for example, [[Expected Family Contribution]], [https://thefinancebuff.com/tax-calculator-aca-obamacare-subsidy.html ACA Health Insurance], and [[IRMAA]] Medicare premium surcharges); see [[Marginal tax rate]] for a more detailed explanation, and [[Traditional versus Roth examples]] for examples.

You can use your favorite [[Tax estimation tools|Tax estimation tool]] to calculate the tax change for the maximum contribution or conversion amount considered. If the (change in tax) divided by (change in income) does match one of the nominal tax brackets (for example, 12%, 22%, 24%, and so on), that is all you need to know. If you get a different answer, more work is needed: using small ($100 or so) changes in income to determine at what point(s) (change in tax) divided by (change in income) gets a new result. This can be done by hand, or using a tool such as the [[Tools_and_calculators#Personal_finance_toolbox|Personal finance toolbox]] that will provide answers in chart form.

==Estimating future marginal tax rate==

Estimating your future marginal tax rate is considerably harder than for today, and high accuracy should not be expected. There are two parts to the estimate: 1) your taxable income, and 2) how tax law will treat that income. While both parts may have high uncertainty, great precision is usually not needed to make a reasonable estimate.

For future tax law, using this year's version is generally recognized as a good starting point, but if you have strong feelings for how tax rates and laws will change in the future, you could make your own calculations. If you are willing to use this year's law, follow the procedure in [[#Calculating_marginal_tax_rate_now|Calculating marginal tax rate now]] but use your estimated future income, filing status, number of dependents, and similar.

There are many methods to estimate future income. Below are two, labeled as "simple" and "detailed". Those looking to retire early and expect their future taxable income will be predominantly from pre-tax withdrawals (that is, little-to-no pension income, dividends, Social Security, and so on) might benefit from a simpler method. Those closer to retirement, or in a career characterized by long periods of low-income training followed by much higher earnings, might benefit from a more detailed method. As with many things, the method [https://quoteinvestigator.com/2011/05/13/einstein-simple/ Should Be Made as Simple as Possible, But Not Simpler].

Whatever method you use:
* To be consistent with using today's tax rates you should ignore inflation by using [https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/investing-basics/glossary/real-return real] [[Historical and expected returns#Expected future returns|expected rates of return]] instead of [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nominal-rate-of-return.asp nominal returns] for investment growth.
* The more conservative your estimates (rates of return, career length, number and size of other retirement income streams, withdrawal rates, and so on), the more likely "use traditional now" will be the answer, and ''vice versa''. Whether those answers will have been correct, only time will tell, because we do not know whether "conservative" or "optimistic" will have been "correct".

===Simple method===

Use &lt;math&gt;Future\ annual\ income = (current\ pretax\ balance) \times (1+r)^t \times WR&lt;/math&gt;

You can do this quickly on any calculator (hand-held, Windows, and so on) that does exponents (for example, the x&lt;sup&gt;y&lt;/sup&gt; button on the Windows calculator).

In this equation,
:''r'' = [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/realrateofreturn.asp Real rate of return] on pre-tax investments, %&lt;br&gt;''t'' = Number of years until withdrawals start (for example, at retirement)&lt;br&gt;''WR'' = Withdrawal rate from pre-tax accounts, % per year

Reasonable guesses for ''r'', ''t'', and ''WR'' can vary widely within (and even outside) the following ranges:&lt;br&gt;
:''r'' - from 2% to 6% (depends on market behavior and asset allocation within the pre-tax accounts)&lt;br&gt;''t'' - from 0 to ? (very dependent on individual circumstances)&lt;br&gt;''WR'' - from 3% (for example, those who think the “[https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Safe_withdrawal_rates 4% rule]” is optimistic) to 8% (such as, those who want to reduce pre-tax balances before starting Social Security and Required Minimum Distributions)

For example, with current pre-tax balance = $375,000, r = 4%, t = 25 years, and WR = 5%, Future annual income = $50,000 per year in today's dollars. The federal tax bracket for $50,000 per year [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/agi.asp Adjusted Gross Income (AGI)] using current tax law is 12%. What the marginal rate will be depends on all the taxpayer's circumstances.

For comparison, if you assume
:r = 2%, t = 20 years, and WR = 3%, Future annual income = $17,000 per year&lt;br&gt;r = 6%, t = 30 years, and WR = 7%, Future annual income = $151,000 per year&lt;br&gt;
In other words, changed assumptions can produce very different results, so take a best guess now and update annually.

You could also choose to assume that some future annual contributions to traditional accounts will be made, for the purpose of deciding whether to make a traditional contribution this year. See the [[#Pre-tax_withdrawals|Pre-tax withdrawals]] section in the detailed method for using a spreadsheet function to do that.

===Detailed method===

A more detailed analysis may give a better answer, but is also more complex to perform. Assumptions about contribution type in the current year, and similar future years, affect the predictions for future income and tax rates, so more than one iteration may be required. See below for a method to estimate each common type of future income.

====Pre-tax withdrawals====

If you plan for the current year to be about the same financially as every year between now and withdrawal, the Future Value function ("=FV" in Excel) is useful for estimating future income:

:&lt;math&gt;Income = FV(r, t, -c, -b) \times WR&lt;/math&gt;

In this equation,
:''r'' = Expected real rate of return on pre-tax investments, %&lt;br&gt;''t'' = Number of years until withdrawals start (such as, at retirement)&lt;br&gt;''c'' = Planned annual pre-tax contributions, including employer contributions/match&lt;br&gt;''b'' = Current aggregate pre-tax balance &lt;br&gt;''WR'' = Withdrawal rate from pre-tax accounts, % per year

If your plan is more complex, involving contributions changing in future years (for example, income expected to rise, catch-up contributions after age 50, large Roth conversions before age 70-72, and so on) then you may need a more complex estimate using a spreadsheet.

Note that this estimate requires an expected pattern of traditional contributions. Begin with a "guess", which can be taken from the list of typical cases, or a prior year's analysis. If, at the end, this "guess" looks to be the wrong choice, you may need to revise that estimate and repeat the analysis.

====Taxable investments====

Investors with significant [[Taxable account|taxable accounts]] should account for yield income (interest, dividends, capital gains distributions) from these investments. At a minimum, the expected yield from taxable investments is:

:&lt;math&gt;Income = FV(r - y \cdot tr_{div}, t, -c, -b) \times y&lt;/math&gt;

In this equation,&lt;br&gt;
:''r'' = Expected real rate of return on taxable investments, %&lt;br&gt;''y'' = Expected yield from investments, %&lt;br&gt;&lt;math&gt;tr_{div}&lt;/math&gt; = Average tax rate on investment yield&lt;br&gt;''t'' = Number of years until withdrawals start (such as, at retirement)&lt;br&gt;''c'' = Planned annual taxable contributions&lt;br&gt;''b'' = Current aggregate taxable balance

If you plan on taking taxable withdrawals, the additional capital gains should also be included.

For a portfolio of mostly passive stock-based mutual funds, a yield of 2% is a reasonable estimate. Bonds and bond-based funds tend to yield higher, so this number should be adjusted upward if your taxable portfolio has a significant bond allocation.

Note that qualified dividends and long-term capital gains are taxed at reduced rates, and these forms of income stack "on top" of other income that is taxed at ordinary rates. So, this income may have little effect on your marginal tax rate for pre-tax withdrawals. However, qualified dividends and long-term capital gains are taken into account for taxation of Social Security benefits, and can add marginal rate to pre-tax withdrawals if the latter shifts the former up into a higher bracket.

====Social Security====

If you plan to retire near the age when you expect Social Security payments will begin, include the expected payment, in the percentage that will be taxable according to the laws for [[Taxation of Social Security benefits|taxation of Social Security benefits]].

Note that taxation of Social Security benefits phases in at a rate of either 50% or 85% for each dollar of other income. Therefore, if your total income is in the phase-in range, you can expect a marginal tax rate 1.5x or 1.85x your tax bracket. Typical planning strategies are to come in either just below, or far above, this rate "spike." If your plan has your income around this spike, reconsider your choice of contribution type and rerun the analysis if necessary. An example of this planning is shown [[#Social_Security_benefits|below]].

Several online tools exist for estimating your future Social Security benefit, on the [https://www.ssa.gov/benefits/calculators/ Social Security Administration (SSA) website] and elsewhere.

====Other income====

Include any other expected forms of taxable income, such as a pension, income from part-time work, royalties, inherited traditional distributions, and rental property income not expected to be sheltered by depreciation.

====Standard deduction====

As of 2025, the standard deduction is '''$17,000''' (single) or '''$33,200''' (married filing jointly) for taxpayers age 65 and older, or '''$15,000''' (single) or '''$30,000''' (married filing jointly) for taxpayers under age 65. Subtract the most appropriate value from your expected future income.

It is uncommon (but not impossible) for retirees to itemize deductions, so assuming the standard deduction is usually safe. If you expect to itemize deductions, for example due to large charitable donations, an estimated itemized deduction may be used instead.

If you predict you will be in the range of the 1st through 3rd of the IRMAA tiers, add a representative tax rate to your overall marginal tax rate, about '''5%''' as of 2025. If you are confident you will be in the 4th IRMAA tier or above, or well below the 1st IRMAA tier, do not add any tax rate for IRMAA.

The "spike" behavior of IRMAA makes planning difficult, as actual IRMAA marginal tax rates will be either large (if an IRMAA tier threshold is crossed) or zero. Applying an average tax rate give as much accuracy as is possible for a long-term analysis. For a shorter-term analysis, such as Roth conversions in early retirement, using exact tier thresholds may make sense, although there is still the problem of the [[Income-Related_Monthly_Adjustment_Amount_(IRMAA)#Managing_IRMAA_Costs|two-year delay]].

====Analysis====

Look up the total income minus deductions in today's tax rate table for your expected filing status, including any Social Security phase-in, and adding any expected [[State income taxes|state tax rate]] and IRMAA rate, as applicable.

Compare your estimated future marginal tax rate to your marginal rate today, making any adjustments for [[#Maxing_out_your_retirement_accounts|maxing out accounts]], [[#Saver's_credit|Saver's credit]], and/or [[#Employer_match|not getting the full employer match]] as applicable. If the numbers are close or equal, it likely will not make much difference which you pick, so you might choose to mix traditional and Roth contributions, to take advantage of [[#Tax diversification|tax diversification]].

If this analysis shows that your planned contribution choices were correct, you can be confident in that result. If not (for example assuming traditional contributions in the current year and similar future years says Roth is preferred), then rerun with different assumptions. If neither choice appears correct (for example assuming traditional contributions says Roth is preferred, and assuming Roth contributions says traditional is preferred), the optimal choice is some split; see [[#Stradding brackets|Straddling brackets]].

===Results===

Most investors will find that traditional contributions are better during their normal working career, for two reasons:
* Retirees usually need lower income than while working to maintain the same standard of living, because they are no longer saving for retirement, expenses for children have ended, the mortgage is probably paid off, many retirees relocate to lower cost-of-living areas, work-related expenses have ended, or life and disability insurance are no longer needed.
* Retirees pay a lower tax rate on the income they do draw, because [[Progressive tax|lower income usually means lower tax rates]], many retirees live in [[State income taxes|low-tax or tax-free states]], Roth withdrawals and return of basis from [[Taxable account|taxable]] investments are tax-free, [[Capital gains distribution|capital gains]] are taxed at a reduced rate, [[Payroll tax|payroll taxes]] have ended, [[Taxation of Social Security benefits|Social Security]] is 15-100% federally tax-free and not taxed by many states, [[HSA]] withdrawals for medical expenses are tax-free, and so on.

There are plenty of exceptions to this rule, however, including those with very high or very low incomes, planning to move from low-tax to high-tax states, heavy savers who expect more taxable income in retirement than while working, planning to leave money to higher-tax heirs, working around unusual tax laws, and others. A non-exhaustive list of cases where Roth contributions are preferred is [[#Typical_cases|above]].

If you currently have very little tax-deferred retirement savings, your calculated retirement tax rate will be very low, so you will get a big value by contributing more. In fact, due to the federal standard deduction, the first $17,000 or $33,2000 you withdraw in retirement each year (assuming you are over age 65 at the time) should be tax-free. (These values decrease slightly, but not much, with significant [[Taxation of Social Security benefits|Social Security income]]). Assuming a 4% withdrawal rate, that corresponds to an account balance of $425,000 (= $17,000 / 4%) or $830,000 (= $33,200 / 4%) that can be accessed federally tax-free, and these figures should grow with inflation.

As your tax-deferred balance rises, so will your expected tax rate, but as long as it is less than your marginal tax rate now it still makes sense to contribute to tax-deferred accounts. If your expected retirement marginal tax rate ever reaches or exceeds your current marginal tax rate, and you still want to save more, then additional savings should be done in a Roth account.

===Example===

A single investor earns $240,000 gross income and has a marginal tax rate of 32%. He plans to retire in 25 years at age 65. He currently has $600,000 in traditional (tax-deferred) savings, contributes $20,000 per year to this account, and expects it to grow at 8% after fees, and assumes 3% inflation. He expects to take $3,300 per month inflation-adjusted Social Security benefit immediately after retiring, of which he expects 85% to be taxable. He has a taxable account, but the income from that account stacks on top of traditional withdrawals and should be taxed at 15%, and should not affect taxation of Social Security benefits as that will be at 85% regardless, so it can be ignored for this analysis. He does not expect any other additional income in retirement.

His 401(k) allows either traditional or Roth contributions; which should he be making?

Given his relatively high income compared to his savings, it is reasonable to guess that continuing to make 100% traditional contributions will be best. Assuming he continues to make $20,000 traditional contributions, his ''predicted'' retirement marginal tax rate could be calculated as follows:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Taxable income source !! Excel calculation !! Value
|-
| Traditional savings withdrawals || =FV(8%-3%,25,-20000,-600000) * 4% || $119,454
|-
| Taxable Social Security benefits || =3300*12*85% || $33,660
|-
| Single standard deduction (age 65+) || N/A || -$17,000
|-
| '''Predicted taxable income''' || '''=SUM(''above values'')''' || '''$136,114'''
|}
 
Under the current tax bracket structure, his future marginal rate with that income is predicted to be only 24%, which is less than his current marginal rate is 32%. The assumptions in this analysis (maximum ongoing traditional contributions, and maximum Social Security taxation) represent a "worst case" for taxable income in retirement.

Because his marginal rate is still predicted to be less than today, the guess was correct, and he should prefer traditional contributions to Roth for the current year. He should repeat this analysis each year, accounting for actual investment growth and tax law changes.

==Other tax considerations==

===State taxes===
{{Main|State income taxes}}

Consider state taxes as well as federal taxes in your tax rate comparisons, both for the state you live in and for the state you expect to retire in.

Some states do not allow deductions for traditional account contributions, or only allow them for some types of contributions (New Jersey, for example, allows deductions for 401(k) but not 403(b) or IRA contributions); if you live in such a state, the Roth has an advantage.

If your state allows a deduction but you might retire in a state which has no tax or will not tax your traditional IRA withdrawals, then the traditional IRA has a potential advantage.

Conversely, if your state has no income tax but you might retire in a state which taxes traditional IRA withdrawals, the Roth has a potential advantage.

===Estate planning===

If you plan on leaving a significant estate to their heirs, consider multi-generational effects.

For example, if you are a high earner in the 32% tax bracket, and expect to be throughout retirement, but your heirs are lower earners in the 12% tax bracket, you should prefer traditional contributions - your heirs will receive a larger inheritance after tax.

Likewise, if you are in a lower tax bracket than your heirs, you should prefer to contribute to Roth accounts. If you plan to bequeath assets to a tax-exempt charity, that bequest should be from a traditional account as opposed to a Roth, because neither you nor the charity will pay taxes on the funds, and the charity will receive a larger donation.

The [https://waysandmeans.house.gov/sites/democrats.waysandmeans.house.gov/files/documents/SECURE%20Act%20section%20by%20section.pdf SECURE Act of 2019] now requires most non-spouse [[Inheriting_an_IRA|inherited IRAs]] to be completely distributed by the end of the tenth calendar year following the year of the owner's death. If you expect to leave large [[IRA|IRAs]] as part of your estate on a ''per heir'' basis, such that withdrawals will likely push your heirs into a tax bracket higher than yours is now, favor Roth contributions and [[Roth IRA conversions|conversions]] during your lifetime.

Furthermore, in 2022 the IRS proposed regulations that would require RMDs during years 1-9 for some (not all) beneficiaries affected by the 10 year depletion rule. Roth IRAs subject to the 10 year rule do not require RMDs year 1-9.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.morningstar.com/retirement/faqs-about-inherited-iras
| title=Be Aware of These New Rules for Inherited IRAs| author=Christine Benz| publisher=Morningstar|date=March 20, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

See the [[Stretch IRA]] page for strategies if you expect to leave large inherited IRAs. For small IRAs that will not affect your heirs' tax status, simply comparing your marginal tax rate to your heirs' current rate will be sufficient.

For those who choose to leave large IRAs to beneficiaries in testamentary or other irrevocable trusts, the tax rates of income recognized within most such trusts are accelerated and the brackets are compressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1041es.pdf
| title= 2024 Form 1041-ES | author=IRS|p=5|date=2024}}&lt;/ref&gt; For 2025, trust taxable income over $15,650 is taxable at 37% (for income held within the trust, not distributed from the trust). For those that choose to keep the income in trust as long as possible in order to take advantage of trust protections, having a Roth within a trust avoids recognizing future RMDs within the trust at a potentially much higher tax rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=

====Estate tax====

The federal estate tax exemption, $13.99&amp;nbsp;million for individuals and $27.98&amp;nbsp;million&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/estate-tax Small Businesses and Self-Employed: Estate Taxes], IRS.&lt;/ref&gt; for married couples as of 2025, is calculated without regard to whether the accounts are traditional or Roth. This would suggest that Roth contributions and [[Roth IRA conversion|conversions]] would be beneficial in lowering your total tax liability even when the owner's and heir's marginal tax rates are the same, because fewer dollars would be subject to estate tax. Under this assumption, Roth contributions and conversions would be beneficial when:

:&lt;math&gt;MTR_h &gt; MTR_n \cdot (1 - MTR_e)&lt;/math&gt; (derived [[Retirement_plan_analysis_(math)#Conversions_on_estates_subject_to_estate_tax|here]])

where

:&lt;math&gt;MTR_n = \text{marginal tax rate now}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;MTR_e = \text{marginal tax rate on estate}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;MTR_h = \text{marginal tax rate on heirs}&lt;/math&gt;

However, the IRS allows heirs to take a deduction for [[Income in respect of a decedent|Income in Respect of a Decedent (IRD)]] on estate taxes paid when withdrawing from a traditional account,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.kitces.com/blog/understanding-the-irc-section-691c-income-in-respect-of-a-decedent-ird-deduction-for-the-beneficiary-of-an-inherited-ira/ |title= Understanding the IRD Deduction That Inherited IRA Beneficiaries Often Miss |publisher=Kitces Nerd's Eye View|accessdate= May 21, 2023 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this deduction theoretically equalizes the taxes when marginal income tax rates are the same. However, the IRD deduction comes with several caveats that can make it less valuable:

*The deduction is taken below-the-line, meaning some deduction may be lost because it competes with the standard deduction, and it does not reduce the heir's Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) which is used to calculate certain credits
*The deduction is a fixed number of dollars, meaning there is a time-value-of-money loss between when the estate taxes are paid and when the are effectively refunded over the 10-year [[Stretch IRA|stretch]] period
*If your heir owes state income tax, the deduction may not be allowed on the state income tax return
*The federal deduction does not apply to any [[Estate_and_inheritance_tax#State_estate_and_inheritance_taxes|state estate taxes]] paid.&lt;ref&gt;{{forum link| p=7276768 |title=Re: Proposed update to the Roth Conversion wiki page| author=bsteiner| date=May 20, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; The state estate tax rate could be used in the above formula in this case if your heirs will get a deduction for federal but not state estate taxes.
*Heirs have to know to take it. Even some professional accountants may not think to ask your heirs whether they may be entitled to this deduction. If you expect to leave traditional accounts in your estate and to owe estate taxes, make sure your heirs and their accountants know they can take this deduction.

All these factors may mean Roth contributions and conversions are beneficial for an estate subject to estate tax even if the income tax rates are similar.

===Opportunity to convert later===

If you contribute to a traditional IRA, you can convert to a Roth IRA in a later year. If you contribute to a traditional 401(k) and leave your employer, you can roll the 401(k) into a traditional IRA and then convert it later, or roll it directly to a Roth IRA. Your income (and therefore marginal tax rate) might be lower in a year when you separate from an employer. In either case, you may come out ahead if you can convert in a lower tax bracket, because you pay the taxes in the year of conversion instead of the year of contribution. There is no analogous "traditional conversion" whereby you can move money from a Roth account to traditional and reduce your taxable income, so this is an advantage for traditional accounts.

This increases the benefit from using traditional accounts when you retire in a low tax bracket. If you retire in a 12% tax bracket before taking Social Security, and do not need the whole 12% tax bracket for living expenses, you can convert part of your traditional IRA to a Roth at 12%, reducing the amount you will have in the IRA when you start taking Social Security.

But if you expect to retire in the same tax bracket, this is not a significant extra advantage for the traditional accounts. If you are usually in a 22% tax bracket and retire in a 22% tax bracket but happen to have some years in a 12% bracket (large deductions, unemployed part of the year, one spouse takes off from work or works part-time to care for children), you can convert up to the top of the 12% bracket in those years, and you can make those conversions from any traditional accounts you have, whether or not you have Roth accounts.

===Required Minimum Distributions===

Traditional accounts have the disadvantage of having [[Required Minimum Distribution|Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs)]] begin at age 73 for most investors. RMDs are a reasonable percentage of the account balance, but if you expect to want to leave large IRAs as part of your estate and RMDs would hinder this goal, then prefer Roth contributions. Any unspent RMDs would presumably be reinvested in a [[taxable account]], where they would be subject to tax drag.

===Tax risk===

If all else is equal (that is, you expect to retire in the same bracket, and never to have the opportunity to convert in a lower bracket), the Roth account has a slight advantage because there is less tax risk. You might not retire with the same marginal tax rate that you expect, either because tax rates change or because your taxable income is higher or lower.

Traditional accounts have a slight advantage when future income is uncertain. Choosing traditional today and being wrong usually means you have [[Progressive tax|more money]] than you expected in retirement, which is not the worst problem to have. But choosing Roth today and being wrong means you had a significant shortfall in savings for some reason. The size of this asymmetry and whether it should impact decisions today is [https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&amp;t=318512 debated].

Another risk for MFJ filers is the death of one spouse, leaving the survivor with single filing status and its higher marginal rates. Especially if one or both spouses has health issues, it may make sense to bias toward Roth accounts to insure against this possibility.

===Tax diversification===

Tax Diversification is the principle that having assets spread across different kinds of accounts (traditional, Roth, [[Taxable account|taxable]], etc). The further you are from retirement, the harder it is to predict what tax law will be.

By diversifying between current and future tax rates, you effectively provide yourself insurance against large tax rate changes (up or down). Also, it may be the case that there will be certain steep phase-outs, or "bumps" in marginal rates in the future (for example, the current Social Security taxation bumps). Having the flexibility to control your taxable income to some degree might allow you to better optimize around future tax laws.

Conversely, if you only have traditional investments, you will be required to withdraw RMDs or whatever you need to live on, and pay whatever tax results. Even if the traditional vs. Roth analysis described above favors one type or the other, there is a potential advantage to having a mix.

==Investment options==

You may have different investment options in traditional and Roth accounts. If your employer offers a traditional 401(k) but not a Roth 401(k), then you must use traditional accounts if you invest in the 401(k). If you are over the income limit for a deductible traditional IRA, then you must use a Roth account if you invest in an IRA (a non-deductible IRA cannot be better than either a deductible or Roth account). The choice of account, or benefits within the account, may be more important than the different tax treatment of traditional and Roth accounts.

===Employer match===

If your employer matches 401(k) contributions, this is by far the [[Prioritizing investments|best investment]] you can make, as it has an immediate return equal to the match rate. Therefore, regardless of the quality of your employer's plan, you should get the maximum match before investing anywhere else.

If your employer offers both traditional and Roth accounts, any match goes to a traditional account, and the match is calculated without regard to whether your contribution is traditional or Roth. Therefore, if you cannot contribute enough to a Roth account to get the maximum match, you can get a larger match for the same out-of-pocket cost by choosing traditional contributions. You should choose traditional contributions when:

:&lt;math&gt;MTR_w &lt; \frac{(1+m) \cdot MTR_n}{m \cdot MTR_n + 1}&lt;/math&gt; (derived [[Retirement_plan_analysis#Employer_match|here]])

where:

:&lt;math&gt;MTR_n = \text{marginal tax rate now}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;MTR_w = \text{marginal tax rate at withdrawal}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;m = \text{employer match rate}&lt;/math&gt;

Note that if &lt;math&gt;m=0&lt;/math&gt;, then the equation simplifies to a simple comparison of current and future marginal rates.

====Example====

You can afford to contribute $3,000 out-of-pocket (after taxes) to an employer 401k, with both traditional and Roth options, that matches 100% of the first $4,000 of contributions. Your current marginal tax rate is 12%, and your expected marginal tax rate at withdrawal is 18.5% due to [[#Social Security benefits|taxation of Social Security benefits]]. You can contribute $3,000 to the Roth account and receive a $3,000 traditional match, or $3,409 (=$3,000 / (1 - 12%)) to the traditional account, and receive a $3,409 traditional match. The break-even marginal tax rate at withdrawal is calculated as:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{(1+100%) \cdot 12%}{100% \cdot 12% + 1} \approx 21.4%&lt;/math&gt;

Because the predicted marginal tax rate at withdrawal (18.5%) is less than this value, traditional contributions are preferred. If the match rate were only 50%, or if the marginal tax rate at withdrawal were 22%, then Roth would be preferred instead.

===Investment quality and fees===

Many 401(k) plans, and even more retirement plans of other types such as 403(b) plans, have inferior investment options.

If you invest in high-cost funds in a 401(k), you will usually lose more to the high costs than you can gain from any tax difference between the 401(k) and IRA.

Some plans have only high-cost options; in such a plan it is better to max out your IRA (traditional or Roth) before making unmatched contributions to the 401(k).

Other plans have some low-cost options, but have no options or high-cost options in some asset classes. In such a plan, you should prefer to invest enough in an IRA (traditional or Roth) to cover the asset classes with no good option in the 401(k).

Once your IRA is maxed out, it is usually worth contributing even to a bad 401(k). Conversely, some retirement plans, such as the [[Thrift Savings Plan]], have better options than are available to retail investors in IRAs. If you have such a plan, you may prefer that plan to an IRA, even at a tax cost.

Investment quality and tax considerations can be combined into the same calculation, by using the Growth_factor in addition to the marginal tax rates. See also: [[IRA#Comparison_to_employer_accounts|Comparison between IRAs and employer accounts]].

====Example====

You can either contribute $5,000 pre-tax earnings to a traditional 401(k) or a Roth IRA. Your marginal tax rate is 22% now, predicted to be 12% in retirement. The investment is expected to grow at 8% before fees in either case, but the traditional 401(k) charges a 1.00% expense ratio, and the Roth IRA charges a 0.04% expense ratio. Either investment would be withdrawn in 20 years. The future after-tax values of the two investments will be as follows:
:Traditional 401(k): $5,000 * (1 + 8% - 1%)^20 * (1 - 12%) = '''$17,026.61'''
:Roth IRA: $5,000 * (1 + 8% - 0.04%)^20 * (1 - 22%) = '''$18,043.56'''.

Assuming the investments are held for the full 20 year term, the fees in the 401(k) outweigh the tax savings, and the Roth IRA is a superior investment.

However, the tax savings from the traditional contribution is immediate, whereas the fees reduce performance gradually over time. In this circumstance, if you expected to separate from your employer well before the 20 year term, you could roll the 401(k) into either a low-expense traditional IRA, or the 401(k) at your new employer.

Depending on how long the money remained in the high-expense 401(k), you might come out ahead contributing to the 401(k) now.

==Complex cases==

===Social Security benefits===
{{Main|Taxation of Social Security benefits}}

One important exception is the phase-in of taxation of Social Security benefits. If you are in the phase-in range, you may experience a marginal rate in retirement of 22.2% or 40.7% despite being in the 12% or 22% brackets.

The 22.2% "bump" affects Social Security recipients with annual Social Security benefits less than '''$27,236''' (Single) or '''$69,044''' (Married Filing Jointly), and the 40.7% bump affects those receiving more than these values. See the [[Taxation of Social Security benefits|main article]] for more details on where these formulas come from, and for useful visualizations of the phase-in effects.

As a function of annual Social Security benefit (SS), the 22.2% bump begins and ends at the following levels of income from other sources:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Filing status !! 22.2% bump begins !! 22.2% bump ends
|-
| Single || $34,000 - 0.5 * SS || $28,706 + 0.5 * SS
|-
| Married Joint || $47,811 - 0.2297 * SS || $36,941 + 0.5 * SS
|}

As a function of annual Social Security benefit (SS), the 40.7% bump begins and ends at the following levels of income from other sources:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Filing status !! 40.7% bump begins !! 40.7% bump ends
|-
| Single || $48,581 - 0.2297 * SS || $28,706 + 0.5 * SS
|-
| Married Joint || $87,324 - 0.2297 * SS || $36,941 + 0.5 * SS
|}

The 40.7% bump is more abrupt, because it is bracketed by 22.2% below and 22% above. The 22.2% bump is bracketed by 18% below and 12% above. If you are reasonably close (10-15 years or less) to retirement and are in the benefits and income range where you may be affected by either bump, you should try to either come in under the bump, or go far above it, depending on which option is easier.

For those making traditional contributions, switching to Roth to lower taxable income in retirement might be the easiest option.

====Example====

A single investor, age 55, earns $80,000 gross income and has a marginal tax rate of 22%. He plans to retire in 10 years. He currently has $750,000 in traditional (tax-deferred) savings, expected to grow at 6% after fees, and has been making $15,000 annual contributions. He has no significant taxable investments. He expects to receive a $3,400 per month inflation-adjusted Social Security benefit starting upon retirement at age 65. He does not expect any additional income in retirement, from part-time work, investments income, rental properties, or pensions.

His 401(k) allows either traditional or Roth contributions; which should he be making? Because he receives more than $27,236 annual benefit, he is susceptible to the 40.7% bump. Using the above formulas, the bump begins and ends at the following levels of other income:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! 40.7% bump !! Calculation !! Value
|-
| Begins || $48,581 - 0.2297 * $40,800 || $39,208
|-
| Ends || $28,706 + 0.5 * $40,800 || $49,106
|}

If he continues to make traditional contributions and withdraws 4% per year in retirement, his total non-Social Security income will be '''$47,196''' (=FV(6%-3%,10,-15000,-750000)*4%). This toward the top of the 40.7% bump. If he instead contributes $11,700 per year to his 401(k) as '''Roth''' for the next 10 years, his future non-SS income will be reduced to '''$40,317''' (=FV(6%-3%,10,'''0''',-750000)*4%). This is still in the bottom of the 40.7% bracket, but avoids having about $7,000 of income taxed at 40.7%. Roth contributions are by far the better choice.

===Straddling brackets===

Note that the marginal tax rates now and in the future can be affected by the amount contributed to traditional accounts. For example, contributing the full $23,000 to a traditional 401(k) might bring an investor down from the 32% bracket into the 24% bracket. Likewise, contributing more to traditional accounts might raise the predicted future marginal tax rate such that it might cross into a higher bracket.

In these cases, the traditional vs. Roth analysis should be done for ''each dollar'' invested; contributions can be divided in any proportion. The higher the investment performance, longer the time horizon, and higher the contribution limit to traditional accounts, the more likely straddling becomes.

====Example====

A married couple earns $450,000 gross income and plans to retire in 30 years. They currently have $600,000 in traditional (tax-deferred) savings, expected to grow at 9% after fees. They can contribute up to $47,000 total to their 401(k) accounts, and in addition they receive a combined $40,000 of employer contributions and match (not included in their gross income). They can afford to contribute all $47,000 if all contributions are traditional, or the equivalent lesser amount if some are Roth.

They also have a taxable account, but income from that account stacks on top of traditional withdrawals, and is expected to all be taxed at 18.8%, so it can be ignored. They expect to receive a combined $82,000 per year inflation-adjusted Social Security benefit, of which 85% will be taxable. They do not expect any additional income in retirement, from part-time work, investments income other than tax drag from the taxable account, rental properties, pensions, and similar.

Should they make traditional or Roth 401(k) contributions with their $47,000 per year? For fully traditional contributions, their ''predicted'' retirement marginal tax rate could be calculated as follows:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Taxable income source !! Excel calculation !! Value
|-
| Traditional savings withdrawals || =FV(9%-3%,30,-47000-40000,-600000) * 4% || $412,966
|-
| Taxable Social Security benefits || =82000*85% || $69,700
|-
| Married standard deduction (age 65+) || N/A || -$33,200
|-
| '''Predicted taxable income''' || '''=SUM(''above values'')''' || '''$449,466'''
|}
 
Assuming the current tax system remains in effect, their future marginal rate is predicted to be 32%. Their ''current'' marginal tax rate with full traditional contributions would be 24% (taxable income = $450,000 - $47,000 - $30,000 = $373,800). On these assumptions, it appears as though they should prefer Roth contributions.

However, if the calculation is run assuming maximum Roth contributions, the result is different:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Taxable income source !! Excel calculation !! Value
|-
| Traditional savings withdrawals || =FV(9%-3%,30,-40000,-600000) * 4% || $264,337
|-
| Taxable Social Security benefits || =82000*85% || $69,700
|-
| Married standard deduction (age 65+) || N/A || -$33,200
|-
| '''Predicted taxable income''' || '''=SUM(''above values'')''' || '''$300,837'''
|}

Their future marginal rate would therefore be only 24%, and their current marginal rate with full Roth contributions would be 32% (taxable income = $450,000 - $30,000 = $420,000), the opposite of before. The optimal solution is to split contributions between traditional and Roth contributions.

For simplicity, we can check six possible proportions for the elective portion of the contribution, although in practice, spreadsheet or optimization software could automate this calculation to be more precise:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Traditional contribution !! Roth contribution !! Taxable income now !! Taxable income future !! Marginal rate now !! Marginal rate future !! Result
|-
| $0 || $33,688 || $420,000 || $300,837 || 32% || 24% || Too much Roth
|-
| $9,400 || $27,296 || $410,600 || $330,563 || 32% || 24% || Too much Roth
|-
| $18,800 || $20,904 || $401,200 || $360,289 || 32% || 24% || Too much Roth
|-
| '''$28,200''' || '''$14,288''' || '''$391,800''' || '''$390,015''' || '''24%''' || '''24%''' || '''Close to optimal'''
|-
| $37,600 || $7,144 || $382,400 || $419,740 || 24% || 32% || Too much traditional
|-
| $47,000 || $0 || $373,000 || $449,466 || 24% || 32% || Too much traditional
|}

By splitting the contribution, this couple can lower their total taxes by staying within the 24% bracket both now ''and'' in retirement. Note that this analysis is extremely imprecise; it depends on future contributions being made, investments performing as expected, and the tax code remaining the same, most of which are very unlikely to occur.

However, current tax rates are well-known, so if the optimum traditional contribution is close to a step down in marginal rate, it is usually a good idea to contribute just up to that step, then contribute the rest to Roth. In this case, a traditional contribution of '''$25,400''' is probably best, as it puts the couple's taxable income exactly at the 24%/32% bracket boundary at $394,600.

They would therefore also contribute '''$16,416''' (=[$47,000 - $25,400] x [1 - 24%]) to Roth.

===Maxing out your retirement accounts===

The IRS sets a maximum contribution to retirement accounts. If you have reached this maximum, anything else you contribute must be in a taxable account that will (if you pay more than 0% on annual earnings or capital gains) lose money to taxes not incurred in either a traditional or Roth account.

The IRS contribution limits do not distinguish between traditional (pre-tax) and Roth (after-tax) accounts. Because after-tax money is worth more than pre-tax money, Roth accounts effectively allow you to contribute more than traditional accounts.

For example, if your marginal tax rate is 32%, a $23,500 Roth 401(k) contribution will tax-shelter '''$34,559''' (=$23,500 / (1 - 32%)) of pre-tax earnings, whereas a traditional 401(k) contribution can only tax-shelter $23,500.

A fair comparison between Roth and traditional contributions when at a fixed-dollar limit must therefore also take into account the performance of the remaining money in a taxable account.

The after-tax amount invested in the taxable account is simply the tax savings from the traditional contribution, in this case '''$7,520''' (=$23,500 * 32%).

The future after-tax values of the traditional account plus the taxable account can then be compared to the Roth account.

The equivalent conversion decision would be to convert a $23,500 traditional IRA to a Roth IRA, paying the $7,520 tax with money that would otherwise have been invested in a taxable account.

When contributing the maximum, traditional contributions have a higher after-tax value when:

:&lt;math&gt;MTR_w &lt; MTR_n \cdot \frac{v - (v - 1) \cdot {MTR_{cg}}^*}{(1 + r)^t}&lt;/math&gt;

with

:&lt;math&gt;v = (1 + r - y \cdot MTR_{div})^t&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;{MTR_{cg}}^* = MTR_{cg} \cdot \frac{r - y}{r - y \cdot MTR_{div}}&lt;/math&gt;

Variables are defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;MTR_n = \text{marginal tax rate now, for traditional contributions}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;MTR_w = \text{marginal tax rate for traditional accounts at withdrawal}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;MTR_{div} = \text{marginal tax rate on dividends}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;MTR_{cg} = \text{marginal tax rate on capital gains}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;{MTR_{cg}}^* = \text{effective marginal tax rate on capital gains assuming original basis}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;v = \text{growth factor on the taxable balance}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;b = \text{growth factor on the taxable basis}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;r = \text{total rate of return}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;y = \text{yield on the taxable balance}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;t = \text{time}&lt;/math&gt;

The formula is derived [[Retirement_plan_analysis#Maxing_out_retirement_accounts|here]]. That page also contains a more complex formula that includes different rates of return for different accounts.

Other factors affect this decision besides simply after-tax value. The combination of traditional and taxable money retains more flexibility than the Roth; traditional money can be converted to Roth in future years, and taxable money can be withdrawn at any time penalty-free. On the other hand, effectively sheltering more money inside retirement plans by choosing Roth can have [[Asset protection|asset protection]] benefits, and Roth accounts do not require [[Required Minimum Distribution|RMDs]].

====Typical values====

The following table calculates the break-even withdrawal tax rates for various sets of tax rates at different time horizons. All cases assume an investment with a total return of 8% and yield of 2%, of which 90% is taxed at long-term capital gains rates and 10% as ordinary income. If your withdrawal rate is predicted to be above the result in the table, Roth is preferred.

|}

Note how dramatic the effect is for investors with high tax rates; even with a marginal tax rate today of 50.3%, after 40 years Roth contributions give more money after taxes with a withdrawal rate above just ~27%.

====Very high income and wealth====

Investors with high income and wealth, who expect to be in the top tax bracket now ''and in retirement'', should usually prefer Roth contributions, for these reasons:

*Being in the same (top) tax bracket now and in retirement eliminates any tax rate arbitrage between contribution and withdrawal, which is a typical advantage of traditional accounts
*High tax rates on dividends and capital gains heavily degrade the performance of taxable investments, and shift the advantage more toward Roth accounts
*The asset protection benefits of sheltering more money in Roth accounts are probably more significant for those with high income and wealth, and the higher liquidity of taxable accounts is probably less significant

====Example====

You are deciding between traditional and Roth contributions in your 401(k), with a contribution limit of $23,500. Your marginal rate now is 24%, your marginal rate in retirement is predicted to be 22%, your tax rate on qualified dividends and long-term capital gains are both 15%.

Your investments in any account are expected to have annual capital growth of 6% and a yield of 2%, for 8% total return, compounding annually. The yield is comprised of 90% [[Qualified dividend|qualified dividends]] and long-term [[Capital gains distribution|capital gains distributions]]; the remaining 10% yield is taxed as ordinary income.

You plan to withdraw the money in 25 years. Are traditional or Roth contributions preferred?

The dividend tax rate on the taxable investment is:

:&lt;math&gt;MTR_{div} = 90% \cdot 15% + 10% \cdot 24% = 15.9%&lt;/math&gt;

The growth factors for the balance and basis of the taxable investment are:

:&lt;math&gt;v = (1 + 8% - 2% \cdot 15.9%)^{25} \approx 6.362&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;{MTR_{cg}}^* = 15% \cdot \frac{8% - 2%}{8% - 2% \cdot 15.9%} \approx 11.72%&lt;/math&gt;

The withdrawal rate below which traditional contributions are preferred is:

:&lt;math&gt;24% \cdot \frac{6.362 - (6.362 - 1) \cdot 11.72%}{(1 + 8%)^{25}} \approx 20.09%&lt;/math&gt;

Despite the predicted withdrawal tax rate (22%) being less than the current tax rate, Roth contributions have a higher after-tax value. The spreadsheet linked above gives a similar value for a dividend tax rate of 15%. Refer to Figure 1.

[[File:Maxing contribution comparison.PNG|frame|none|Figure 1. Maximizing Contribution Comparison|alt=Maximizing Contribution Comparison]]

You should decide whether the tax savings (about 2% of the contribution) is worth the partial loss of liquidity.

===Saver's credit===

[[Saver's credit]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irs.gov/uac/Get-Credit-for-Your-Retirement-Savings-Contributions Get Credit for Your Retirement Savings Contributions], and [http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f8880.pdf IRS Form 8880: Credit for Qualified Retirement Savings Contributions]&lt;/ref&gt; is effectively a match from the IRS on your retirement contributions if you have a relatively low income. The credit is given for contributions to either traditional or Roth accounts. However, there are two advantages which may make traditional contributions more attractive.

If you cannot afford to contribute $2,000 to a Roth account, then you can contribute more to a traditional account for the same out-of-pocket cost to get a larger match. In addition, the credit is based on your adjusted gross income. Contributions to a traditional IRA or 401(k) reduce your adjusted gross income and may make you eligible for the credit, or for a larger credit.

While qualifying for the saver's credit, traditional or Roth can be decided upon using the following analysis. Traditional contributions are preferred when:

:&lt;math&gt;MTR_w &lt; \frac{MTR_{n,T} - MTR_{n,R}}{1 - MTR_{n,R}}&lt;/math&gt; (derived [[Retirement_plan_analysis#Saver.27s_Credit|here]])

where:

:&lt;math&gt;MTR_{n, T} = \text{marginal tax rate now, for the traditional contribution, including Saver's Credit}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;MTR_{n, R} = \text{marginal rate now of Saver's Credit for the Roth contribution}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;MTR_w = \text{marginal tax rate for traditional contributions at withdrawal}&lt;/math&gt;

====Example====

Consider a single filer with $30,000 gross income. For that person, up to a $2,000 contribution, &lt;math&gt;MTR_{n,T} = 22%&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;MTR_{n,R} = 10%&lt;/math&gt;

For a $2,000 traditional contribution, the equivalent Roth contribution is &lt;math&gt;R = $2,000 \cdot (1 - 22%) / (1 - 10%) = $1,733&lt;/math&gt;

The withdrawal marginal tax rate for equivalent results is:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{22% - 10%}{1 - 10%} \approx 13.33%&lt;/math&gt;

If this investor expects the actual withdrawal marginal tax rate will be less than 13.3%, traditional is better. If more than 13.3%, Roth is better.

===Non-progressive tax rates===

The methods described earlier in this article assume that your marginal tax rate vs. contribution curve is either [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monotonic_function flat or decreasing], and your marginal tax rate vs. withdrawal curve is flat or increasing. This behavior would be typical of a simple [[Progressive tax|progressive tax]] system.

The US tax code, however, is not simple. Some credits, for example the [[w:Earned_income_tax_credit|Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC)]] and the [[Saver's credit]], may apply only after a certain amount of low benefit contributions. Similarly, the [[Taxation of Social Security benefits]] may cause high rates on some portion of withdrawals, but past that portion the rates decrease.

The following example illustrates the general method for dealing with real-world non-progressive tax curves. Consider a couple with two children earning $66,000 per year gross income. Their marginal tax rate curve is shown in Figure 2.

[[File:NonMonotonicMarginalRate2.png|frame|none|Figure 2. Tax Rate vs. 401k Contribution (negative values because tax decreases as contributions go up)|alt=Tax Rate vs. 401k Contribution]]

The plot was generated by the [[Tools_and_calculators#Personal_finance_toolbox|Personal Finance Toolbox]], an Excel spreadsheet useful for a wide variety of tax situations, including generating tax rate plots like shown above. The plot has negative values because the tax goes down as the 401(k) contribution goes up. The rest of this example follows the convention of ignoring the negative sign and refers to the rate at which tax was avoided.

Their marginal tax rate goes through regions of 22%, 43%, 33%, 31%, and 21%, and there are $200 and $600 spikes due to a change in the Saver's Credit tier from 10% to 20% to 50%.
* 22%: 12% bracket plus 10% saver's credit
* 43%: 12% bracket plus 10% saver's credit plus 21% Earned Income Tax Credit phase-in
* 33%: 12% bracket plus 21% Earned Income Tax Credit phase-in (saver's credit maximum contribution reached for this example)
* 31%: 10% bracket plus 21% Earned Income Tax Credit phase-in
* 21%: 0% bracket plus 21% Earned Income Tax Credit phase-in

In order to capture the effect of the various peaks, valleys, and spikes, remember the operative definition of marginal tax rate: '''[total additional tax] / [total additional contribution]'''. In the chart above, the "Cumulative" curve shows that calculation starting at $0 contribution.

For example, even though the marginal tax rate is 43% for contributions between $1,500 and $2,000, this couple would have to contribute $1,500 at only 22% in order to achieve that benefit. A $2,000 401(k) contribution would result in a tax decrease of $530.56, for a marginal tax rate of about 26.5% ($530.56 / $2,000).

====Method====

When analyzing non-progressive rates, the key is to find particular points on the tax curve that have especially favorable tax rates. You can then contribute chunks of savings to reach these points until you reach your savings limit. These points can be found using the following method:

# Starting at a traditional contribution of $0, calculate the marginal tax rates ([total additional tax saved] / [total additional contribution]) for all contributions between the starting point and the maximum contribution (limited by either IRS rules, or how much you can afford to save).
# Find the maximum marginal rate and the corresponding contribution. This contribution range may be a normal bracket (if the marginal rates within the range are flat) or a ''pseudo-bracket'' comprised of non-progressive regions and spikes. A pseudo-bracket behaves like a regular bracket if you contribute only at the top of the bracket.
# If the maximum marginal rate is greater than your predicted marginal tax rate at withdrawals, make that traditional contribution. Then return to Step #1 with the starting $0 reset to the traditional contributions so far. If the contribution marginal tax rate becomes lower than the expected withdrawal tax rate, contribute remaining retirement savings to Roth accounts.

The [https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=417229 Effective Bracket Calculator] tool linked in the forums automates this calculation, and can take inputs from the tax rate tables generated by the Personal Finance Toolbox.

====Analysis====

The married one-earner couple described above predict a 22% marginal tax rate in retirement. They can afford to save $15,000 after taxes to retirement accounts. How much should they contribute to traditional and Roth accounts?

Plugging the tax rate table output from the Personal Finance Toolbox into the Effective Bracket Calculator finds the three effective brackets and calculates the first three columns of this table:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Cumulative traditional contribution !! Incremental traditional contribution !! Maximum tax rate !! Incremental tax savings !! Net after-tax cost !! Invest?
|-
| $18,500 || $18,500 || 35.992% || $6,658.47 || $11,841.53 || Yes
|-
| $20,000 || $1,500 || 31.060% || $465.90 || $1,034.10 || Yes
|-
| Up to $25,000 || Up to $5,000 || 21.060% || Up to $1,053.00 || Up to $3,947.00 || No
|}

The $0-$18,500 pseudo-bracket and $18,500-$20,000 normal bracket both have rates higher than expected at withdrawal, so this couple should contribute '''$20,000''' traditional for a net after-tax cost of $12,875.62 (=$11,841.53 + $1,034.10).

Additional traditional contributions beyond $20,000 only save at a rate of 21.06%, less than the expected withdrawal rate, so the remaining contributions should be Roth. For a total after-tax cost of $15,000, Roth contributions should be '''$2,124''' (=$15,000.00 - $12,875.63).

Additional examples may be found in [[Traditional versus Roth examples]].

====Current and future non-progressive rates====

For situations where ''both'' the marginal savings rate and marginal tax rate at withdrawal are irregularly shaped (perhaps due to [[Taxation of Social Security benefits|taxation of Social Security benefits]]), one possible method could be as follows:

# For every possible traditional contribution, calculate the maximum amount of Roth and [[Taxable account|taxable]] contributions that can be made while still having enough spending money to cover expenses.
# For each case, calculate the future value (using "=FV" in Excel, or similar) of the traditional, Roth, and taxable accounts at retirement.
# Calculate the total taxes due in retirement, and the after-tax value of investment withdrawals. The set of contributions with the highest after-tax value is best.
# The analysis should be repeated every year.

The [https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=352921 Future Value] tool linked in the forums provides this capability and automates calculation of future non-progressive tax rates due to [[Income-Related Monthly Adjustment Amount (IRMAA)|IRMAA]] and Social Security taxation phase-in.

      <text bytes="19770" sha1="a4kfomdvh3t5lrth4vpif11tb98xa2r" xml:space="preserve">A '''safe withdrawal rate''' (SWR) is the quantity of money, expressed as a percentage of the initial investment, which you can withdraw per year from a portfolio, for a given quantity of time, including adjustments for inflation, without portfolio failure, where 'without failure' is a 95% probability of not running out of money at any time within the specified period.

'''Usage:''' A "safe withdrawal rate" is typically an approximation of the probability that a given portfolio can support a given annual spending component for a required period, with a reasonable confidence. To do this, you would use variables such as the allocation of assets within a model portfolio, the beginning balance, and/or the number of years expected in retirement are varied, apply a model to them, and then compare the results of altering these variables to optimize for the best outcome. 

'''Controversy:''' Unfortunately, the term "safe withdrawal rate" is ambiguous. This is because initial methods used historical data to statically determine what ''would have been'' safe, given the actual results that past portfolios would have generated with the variables given. The next logical step, of course, was to use that information to predict ''future'' SWRs. Either use is technically correct, but to avoid unnecessary arguments, you need to be clear if you use the term for past SWRs or projected SWRs.

==Studies and papers==
=== Trinity study === 
Philip L. Cooley, Carl M. Hubbard and Daniel T. Walz authored an early and influential paper, ''Retirement Savings: Choosing a Withdrawal Rate That Is Sustainable.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://incomeclub.co/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/retirement-savings-choosing-a-withdrawal-rate-that-is-sustainable.pdf| title=Retirement Savings: Choosing a Withdrawal Rate That Is Sustainable| publisher=AAII Journal| date=February 1998| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150702114906/https://incomeclub.co/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/retirement-savings-choosing-a-withdrawal-rate-that-is-sustainable.pdf| archive-date=July 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the authors were professors at Trinity University in San Antonio, Texas, it is often referred to as "the Trinity study." The authors studied actual historical stock and bond returns from 1926 through 1995 to determine sustainable withdrawal rates. The study has gained renewed significance in light of recent turbulent economy.

Using all of the historical data, the professors looked at five possible portfolio compositions, from 100 percent stocks to 100 percent bonds - the three other portfolios had a stock/bond allocation of: 75/25, 50/50, and 25/75 - and evaluated the impact of fixed annual withdrawals ranging from three percent to twelve percent. The [[S&amp;P 500 index]] represented stocks, and long-term high grade domestic bonds represented bonds.

Payout periods were in five-year intervals, from 15 to 30 years. In the study, the professors considered a portfolio successful if it ended a particular withdrawal period with a positive (not zero, and not negative) value.

The study produced a number of conclusions, including:

* Withdrawal periods longer than fifteen years dramatically reduced the probability of success at withdrawal rates exceeding five percent.
* Bonds increase the success rate for lower to mid level withdrawal rates, but most retirees would benefit with at least a 50 percent allocation to stocks.
* Retirees who want inflation-adjusted withdrawals must expect a substantially lower withdrawal rate from the initial portfolio.
* Stock-dominated portfolios using a three to four percent withdrawal rate may create rich heirs at the expense of the retiree's current standard of living.
* For a payout of fifteen years or less, a withdrawal rate of eight to nine percent from a stock-dominated portfolio appears sustainable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| publisher=New York Life| url=https://www.newyorklife.com/cda/0,3254,14198,00.html| title=Key to Making Retirement Savings Last: The Withdrawal Rate}}{{dead link}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="restud1"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.retireearlyhomepage.com/restud1.html| title=The Retire Early study on safe withdrawal rates| publisher=Retire Early Home Page| accessdate=November 13, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Limitations of the Trinity study===
One scenario backtested in the Trinity study suggests that a retiree with a suitably allocated $1&amp;nbsp;million portfolio could withdraw $40,000 the first year, give themselves a cost-of-living adjustment every year afterwards, and have a 98% chance of the portfolio lasting at least 30 years.

Taken literally, such a plan has been criticized as unrealistic. Even if the tests showed that the plan had a 98% success rate over all past time periods, would a prudent person blindly go on steadily increasing withdrawals in a prolonged bear market? It also leads to apparent absurdities. Suppose retirees Alice and Bob have saved $1&amp;nbsp;million in 2008, and the market crash reduces their portfolios to $800,000 in 2009. Alice, however, retires in 2008 while Bob waits until 2009. The Trinity study bases withdrawals the dollar value of the portfolio at the start of retirement. The value fluctuates with the vagaries of the stock market. As a result, even though their situations are almost identical, in the Trinity scenario, because Alice retired in 2008 she is allowed to withdraw $40,000 plus COLA in 2009; while Bob, despite being in an almost identical situation, would be allowed only $32,000. 

The authors of the paper, however, did not mean for their scenarios to be applied rigidly or uncritically. The article makes this very important statement:
{{quotation|The word ''planning'' is emphasized because of the great uncertainties in the stock and bond markets. Mid-course corrections likely will be required, with the actual dollar amounts withdrawn adjusted downward or upward relative to the plan. The investor needs to keep in mind that selection of a withdrawal rate is ''not'' a matter of ''contract'' but rather a matter of ''planning''.}}

[[User:Nisiprius | Nisiprius]] requested clarification from Professor Philip L. Cooley, senior author of the Trinity study:&lt;ref name="SWR"&gt;{{forum link| t=53956| title=What the Trinity Study authors meant}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quotation|What the "4% SWR" means is not that you can treat a portfolio as if it were a guaranteed annuity.

I think all the [Trinity] authors meant is that if it is late 2008 and your stocks halve in value, you don't need to halve your spending instantly. It's OK to cross your fingers and continue spending according to the 4%-then-COLAed plan, even though it means dipping into capital, and it's OK to go on doing that for a while.}}

This rule and its variants finance a constant, non-volatile spending plan using a risky, volatile investment strategy. As a result, retirees accumulate unspent surpluses when markets outperform and face spending shortfalls when markets underperform. The previous work on this subject has focused on the probability of short falls and optimal portfolio mixes. We will focus on the rule’s inefficiencies—the price paid for funding its unspent surpluses and the overpayments made to purchase its spending policy. We show that a typical rule allocates 10%-20% of a retiree’s initial wealth to surpluses and an additional 2%-4% to overpayments. Further, we argue that even if retirees were to recoup these costs, the 4% rule’s spending plan often remains wasteful, since many retirees may actually prefer a different, cheaper spending plan.}}

==Trinity Study and asset allocation==

[[Asset allocation | Asset allocation]] for retirees is a very important issue. Choosing your asset allocation will depend on a number of important factors, including your desired retirement income level and your retirement income sources. The income levels you want will be affected by whether or not you are supporting others (such as a spouse) with your retirement income, and whether you might want to leave an inheritance or bequeath a charitable donation. Primary sources of retirement income include Social Security and any other employer-based defined benefit pensions you receive, as well as any income from annuitizing part of your wealth. Other income is available if you have the flexibility to return to work, should the need arise.

The income you need from an investment portfolio must cover any money you need to regularly withdraw over your life expectancy, any additional money you may want to withdraw if possible, and the taxes you will pay on the income you withdraw. The costs of administering the portfolio are also a critical factor.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;{{forum link| p=1007284| title=Trinity Study Authors update their results| author=Wade Pfau| quote=The 50-50 portfolio over 30 years with 4% withdrawals had a 96% success rate without fees, 84% success rate with 1% fees, and 65% success rate with 2% fees. This, in and of itself, is a reason to be cautious about using 4%.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These withdrawals will give you the percentage of your wealth these needs and wants imply, and can give an idea of how much flexibility you might have to let your withdrawals fluctuate over time. The Trinity and other studies look at what percentage portfolio withdrawal rate (over a number of portfolio asset allocations) is sustainable without being prematurely depleted (the early studies suggested a sustainable withdrawal rate of 4%). Entire books can and have been written on this topic.

The question addressed here is not "What should my asset allocation be in retirement?," but rather ''"What do the Trinity study and other related studies imply about asset allocation?"''

Early studies which helped develop the 4% rule recommended asset allocations for retirees that were on the aggressive side. In the conclusion of William Bengen’s original 1994 article that started research in this area, he wrote:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=William P. Bengen| date=1994| url=https://spwfe.fpanet.org:10005/public/Unclassified%20Records/FPA%20Journal%20March%202004%20-%20The%20Best%20of%2025%20Years_%20Determining%20Withdrawal%20Rates%20Using%20Histo.pdf| title=Determining Withdrawal Rates Using Historical Data| publisher=Journal of Financial Planning 7, 4 (October): 171-180}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
{{quotation|Despite advice you may have heard to the contrary, the historical record supports an allocation of between 50-percent and 75-percent stocks as the best starting allocation for a client. For most clients, it can be maintained throughout retirement, or until their investing goals change. Stock allocations below 50 percent and above 75 percent are counterproductive.}}

Meanwhile, in their 2011 update, the Trinity authors conclude:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author1=Philip L. Cooley| author2=Carl M. Hubbard| author3=Daniel T. Walz| date=2011| url=https://www.onefpa.org/journal/Pages/Portfolio%20Success%20Rates%20Where%20to%20Draw%20the%20Line.aspx| title=Portfolio Success Rates: Where to Draw the Line| publisher=Journal of Financial Planning 24, 4 (April)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quotation|The sample data suggest that clients who plan to make annual inflation adjustments to withdrawals should also plan lower initial withdrawal rates in the 4 percent to 5 percent range, again, from portfolios of 50 percent or more large-company common stocks, in order to accommodate future increases in withdrawals.}}

Boglehead’s Forum user ''traumamoma'' noticed in the updated Trinity study’s Table 2 for inflation-adjusted withdrawals that a 75% stock allocation maximized the probability of success, writing:
{{quotation|I guess the only question left to be asked is how many of us approaching retirement ( I am 6-7 years away ) are prepared to head into the great unknown of retirement with 75 percent in equities? It scares the hell out of me, to be honest. It is gonna take some real intestinal fortitude. I would have a tough time with that allocation now with 2 paychecks coming in every few weeks. Once the paychecks stop, it will be exponentially tougher. I would love to know if people are prepared to jettison "age in bonds" and actually act on the data presented above...}}
Fortunately for those who feel the same way as ''traumamoma'', more recent work in this area has shown a reduced need for such an aggressive asset allocations for retirees.

First, regarding the Trinity study itself, the fact that 75% stocks increased the probability of success for 4% inflation-adjusted withdrawals is not a strong reason to choose this allocation. The difference between 100% success for 75/25 and 96% for 50/50 is just that in two years (1965 and 1966) the maximum withdrawal rate fell slightly below 4% with 50/50, but stayed slightly above 4% with 75/25. It is not that big of deal when considering your overall return requirements and tolerance for risk. 

As well, already by 1996, William Bengen produced a figure showing that the safe withdrawal rate from a historical perspective varied very little for stock allocations between 35% and 90%. Using data for the S&amp;P 500 and intermediate-term government bonds, he found that the historically-safe withdrawal rate was always above 4% for rolling 30-year periods since 1926 for stock allocations between 35% and 90%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=William P. Bengen| date=1996| url=http://www.bobsfinancialwebsite.com/pdfs/1996_Bengen_15388_1.pdf| title=Asset Allocation for a Lifetime| publisher=Journal of Financial Planning 9, 8 (August): 58-67| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100702203054/http://www.bobsfinancialwebsite.com/pdfs/1996_Bengen_15388_1.pdf| archive-date=July 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The difference in data choice for the fixed income component between William Bengen's work and the Trinity study deserves mention. William Bengen used intermediate-term government bonds, which allows for a 100% success rate for the inflation-adjusted 4% withdrawal rate rule. Meanwhile, the Trinity study uses more volatile long-term corporate bonds, which caused the maximum inflation-adjusted withdrawal rate for new retirees in 1965 and 1966 to dip below 4%.

In 2010, [[Wade Pfau]] produced a similar figure (see Figure 1) using data between 1900 and 2008 for 17 developed market countries.&lt;ref name="international"&gt;{{cite web| author=Wade Pfau| author-link=Wade Pfau| title=An International Perspective on Safe Withdrawal Rates from Retirement Savings: The Demise of the 4 Percent Rule?| publisher=Journal of Financial Planning 23, 12 (December): 52-61| url=https://ssrn.com/abstract=1699526| accessdate=November 13, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S. case, with this dataset, the choice of stock allocations between 30% and 80% had very little impact on the safe withdrawal rate. This 2010 article also notes that the United States experienced very favorable asset returns during the 20th century relative to most other developed market countries. Hoping for a repeat performance of this in the 21th century may be overly optimistic. Specifically on the issue of whether future U.S. asset returns will be as high as past returns, [[John Bogle]] wrote in 2009, "Please, please please: Don't count on it" (page 60). This viewpoint suggests caution about expecting an overly aggressive stock allocation to work out as well as it has in the past.

==Monte Carlo simulations and sensitivity analysis==

[[File:Pfau-Figure-2.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Figure 1. Maximum sustainable withdrawal rate by percentage allocation to stocks&lt;ref name="international" /&gt;]]

The above discussions were based on rolling 30-year periods from the historical data. Bogleheads Forum member Dick Purcell used the "Portfolio Pathfinder" software to investigate this issue using Monte Carlo simulations, which are simulated data based on the same underlying characteristics (means, standard deviations, and correlations) as the updated Trinity study. He reported the following results through private correspondence:
{{quotation|Applying Monte Carlo with the Trinity return-rate-probability data you provided, I get success probabilities well below what I’ve seen reported from historical-sequence simulation, and remarkable insensitivity to allocations. Here is a summary of what I get: 

*30 years, withdrawal 4% inflation-adjusted (no fees): 
#Considering all allocations, the best success probability is 87%. 
#That 87% success probability is achieved at any allocation that is at least 60% stocks. 
#An 86% success probability is achieved with stocks allocation 40% or 50%. 

*Reduce withdrawal to 3.5% inflation-adjusted (no fees): 
#Considering all allocations, the best success probability is 92%. 
#That 92% success probability is achieved at any allocation from 20% stocks to 80% stocks. 

*Reduce withdrawal to 3% inflation-adjusted (no fees): 
#Considering all allocations, the best success probability is 98%. 
#That 98% success probability is achieved only with 0% stocks. 
#A 97% success probability is achieved with any allocation from 20% stocks to 80% stocks.}}

Also relevant to this issue, in 2011, Wade Pfau produced a figure which looked at the issue of optimal asset allocation over the working phase of a career and measured the expected satisfaction received from the distribution of wealth accumulation possibilities at retirement for different asset allocation strategies that varied over time as retirement approaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Wade Pfau| author-link=Wade Pfau| title=An Optimizing Framework for the Glide Paths of Lifecyle Asset Allocation Funds.| publisher=Applied Economic Letters. Vol. 18, No. 1 (2011), 55-58| url=https://ssrn.com/abstract=1488670}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the most aggressive of investors may wish to keep 100% stocks at their time of their retirement, the range of investors from somewhat aggressive to quite conservative would find their optimal asset allocations at retirement as ranging between 30% and 70% stocks.

Before concluding, a few key assumptions for these studies must be understood. ''First, they are based on historical data from the U.S., and so the applicability of these success probabilities depends on future stock and bond returns behaving with the same patterns as we have seen historically.'' Second, because these studies rely on long periods of historical data, they tend to only include stocks and traditional bonds. Retirees may wish to consider including TIPS in their retirement portfolios, as well as international assets, real estate, and other alternative assets. Third, though it is beyond the scope of this discussion to be considered further, retirees may wish to investigate whether they can benefit from purchasing nominal and/or inflation-adjusted annuities with a part of their retirement wealth.

These points aside, generally speaking, the studies mentioned above together tend to suggest that stock allocations anywhere between 20% and 80% will keep retirees within their area where maximum sustainable withdrawal rates will be at their highest. Beyond this, you should consider your own return needs and risk tolerances to decide on which asset allocation is most appropriate. One final point is that these studies almost uniformly discourage a 0% stock allocation, although the results may or may not be different if TIPS could be incorporated into the analysis.

      <text bytes="22577" sha1="l0vx2jsfzxzou3nw0lbgv6r2htwgh6f" xml:space="preserve">When it comes time to start taking withdrawals from your retirement portfolio, there are several '''withdrawal methods''' you can use.  What is most important to you?  Is it having a constant withdrawal amount?  Do you need the amount adjusted for inflation each year? Is protection of your principal more important, or do you want to spend it all and be flat broke just in time for the grim reaper?  Maybe you want something in-between. Here we will explain some complicated-sounding strategies, such as “constant-dollar” and “constant-percentage.” But don’t worry - it won't be as difficult as it sounds.

==Constant-dollar==
A constant-dollar withdrawal is the most commonly discussed method.   The famous [[Safe withdrawal rates#Trinity Study:|Trinity Study]] considered  what annual rate of retirement withdrawals retirees can sustain. In other words, what is the rate at which the retiree is not likely to run out of money?  

When you apply this method, you take your first yearly withdrawal based on a percentage of your investment portfolio value (Trinity says 4%). In the second year your withdrawal amount will not be based on your portfolio’s value. Instead, you return to the first year withdrawal amount and adjust it upward at the rate of inflation. For the third and each subsequent year, you go back to the previous year’s withdrawal amount and then adjust it upward using the current rate of inflation.

The advantage of this method is that your withdrawals are predictable and constant in “real dollars.”  This means your annual withdrawal amount maintains the same real spending power after inflation.  The disadvantage is if the market starts a prolonged downturn just before or during your first few years of retirement, your assets could be substantially or entirely depleted as you continue to take a larger inflation-adjusted withdrawal each year.

You might prefer this method if you have relatively high fixed expenses, and you want the predictability of a constant 'paycheck.'

|+'''Figure 1: Graph of constant-dollar yearly withdrawals and remaining portfolio value.'''
|-

|}

==Constant-percentage==
Let’s consider a constant-percentage withdrawal. Do you need to ensure you always have some savings left?  If so, withdraw the same percentage annually based on your current portfolio balance. Because the value of your portfolio will change annually with the ups and downs of the financial markets, keep in mind the dollar amount you withdraw will also fluctuate from year-to-year.

Annual withdrawals are not automatically increased for inflation; instead, this method counts on long-term portfolio growth to take care of inflation.

The advantage of this method is its simplicity -  just multiply your portfolio balance each year by your withdrawal percentage. Your portfolio still might decrease in value, depending on market conditions and the rate of withdrawal you choose, but you will never run out of money. The disadvantage is your withdrawal amounts will always fluctuate with your portfolio’s value. You'll have to spend less in years when your portfolio value drops, and unless portfolio returns are good, you may not have enough in later years to keep up with inflation.
You might prefer this method if you have lower fixed expenses - that is, year-to-year flexibility in spending.

:{| style = "width:500px;"
|+'''Figure 2: Graph of constant-percentage yearly withdrawals and remaining portfolio value.'''
|-
|align = "center"|[[File:Constantpercentage.jpg|450px]]
|}


==Variable-percentage==
You would like to spend more but without fear of running out of money? Have a look at [[Variable percentage withdrawal]] (VPW). This method lets you withdraw an increasing percentage annually based on your current portfolio balance. Because the value of your portfolio will change annually with the ups and downs of the financial markets, keep in mind the dollar amount you withdraw will also fluctuate from year-to-year.

The [[Variable percentage withdrawal]] spreadsheet takes into account the projected maximal length of your retirement and your portfolio's asset allocation (division between stocks and bonds) to compute a table of increasing withdrawal percentages for each projected year of retirement. Each year, multiply your portfolio balance by that year's percentage to get the actual withdrawal dollar amount.

The advantage of this method is its ability to let you spend most of your portfolio, but with the assurance of never running out of money before the end of the selected depletion period. It is also very simple to use: just multiply your portfolio balance each year by that year's withdrawal percentage. The disadvantage is your withdrawal amounts will always fluctuate with your portfolio’s value. You'll have to spend less in years when your portfolio value drops. But, as you are spending an increasing percentage of your portfolio each year, you'll have more than if you had selected a constant-percentage withdrawal. You might prefer this method if you have year-to-year flexibility in spending, and you have no bequest motives.

|-
|align = "center"|[[File:Variablepercentage.png|450px]]
|}

==Spend only the dividends==
If you wish to keep your principal investment amount intact, you might consider using a method where you only spend the dividend and interest income from your investments.

The advantage is clear, but like the constant percentage method, it may result in fluctuating income amounts as dividend and interest income rates for your investments change. Also, while having a large bond percentage will increase your interest income with this method, having too few growth investments exposes you to the risk of not keeping up with inflation over the long term.
You might prefer this method if your expenses are small in relation to your portfolio size, and if you wish to leave a large amount to your heirs.

:{| style = "width:500px;"
|+ '''Figure 4. Graph of dividends-only yearly withdrawals and remaining portfolio value.'''
|-
|align = "center"|[[File:Dividends.jpg|450px]]
|}

==Asset allocation during withdrawal==
When you take money out of your portfolio, you should consider more than just the method of withdrawal.  Consider your current asset allocation between stocks and bonds, and decide if your allocation will be changed during the withdrawal phase.
Most withdrawal method studies, including the famous [[Safe withdrawal rates#Trinity Study|Trinity Study]], assume annual rebalancing of the portfolio using a constant ratio between stocks and bonds. 

However, the reality is many retirees prefer not to keep a static stock/bond allocation throughout retirement.  They gradually reduce their stock allocation and increase their bond allocation – they move toward a more conservative allocation.  One popular method Bogleheads use is to adjust the stock/bond allocation each year so that the bond percentage is equal to the owner’s age. This means you would make a 1% portfolio allocation adjustment every year.

===Constant-dollar (age in bonds)===
Let’s look at how changing your allocation each year would work, and particularly what happens when you combine age-in-bonds with the [[#Constant-dollar | constant-dollar method detailed before]]. First, let’s quickly review constant-dollar. Your first yearly withdrawal will be based on a percentage of your investment portfolio (say 4%). In subsequent years, the withdrawal is no longer based on your portfolio value, but is your first year’s withdrawal amount, adjusted for inflation each year thereafter.

Look at the Figure 5 below and compare it to the first constant-dollar graph, Figure 1 above. You can see the effect from changing the stock/bond allocation each year to be equal to the person's age. The graph shows this change for ages 55-90.

:{| style = "width:500px;"
|+'''Figure 5: Graph of constant-dollar yearly withdrawals and remaining portfolio value. Bond percentage adjusted each year to equal age.'''
|-
|align = "center"|[[File:ConstantDollarAgeInBonds.jpg|450px]]

|}

Again, the advantage is that your withdrawals are predictable and constant in real dollar terms - always equal to your first withdrawal, and then adjusted each year for inflation. But a new disadvantage is that your overall portfolio value will decline at a faster rate, especially during the later years.  The reason is because each year you are increasing your withdrawals at the same time you are reducing the growth part of the portfolio - stocks.  Therefore, you have to use a greater portion of your principal in the later years to keep up with inflation.  On average, the more in bonds you hold each year the lower will be your overall returns.  If you do not intend to leave a lot on the table for your heirs and you would rather not deal with market volatility in your final years, this might be a good approach.

===Constant-percentage (age in bonds)===
Next, let’s use the same age-in-bonds approach just demonstrated for the Constant-Dollar method and apply it to the [[#Constant-percentage|constant-percentage method]]. First, let’s review constant-percentage.  You withdraw the same percentage annually from your current portfolio balance. Recall that the value of your portfolio will change based on the ups and downs of the financial markets, so the dollar amount you withdraw will fluctuate from year-to-year.

Look at the Figure 6 below and compare it to the first constant-percentage graph, Figure 2 above. You can see the effect from changing the stock/bond allocation each year to be equal to the person's age. The graph shows this change for ages 55-90. 

:{| style = "width:500px;"
|+ '''Figure 6: Graph of constant-percentage yearly withdrawals and remaining portfolio value. Bond percentage adjusted each year to equal age.'''
|-
|align = "center"|[[File:ConstantPercentageAgeInBonds.jpg|450px]]
|}

Again, your annual withdrawals aren't automatically increased for inflation; instead, this method counts on long-term portfolio growth to take care of inflation. Since the portfolio allocation becomes more conservative each year, its growth in total value will be less since you have a higher bond allocation each year based on age. However, the year-to-year portfolio withdrawal differences are also minimized because the increased bond allocation improved the stability of returns. Look at the down market of 2000-2002. In this chart example, the person was older and had a larger allocation to bonds.  When you combine Constant-Percentage with age-in-bonds, changes in your annual withdrawal amounts are more smoothed than if you use Constant-Percentage alone. 

==Alternative withdrawal methods==
===Combination===
There are many alternative withdrawal methods. The following method is based on the Galeno Strategy and is intended to be representative of many of the alternative methods which are generally designed to overcome one or more disadvantages of the constant-dollar or constant-percentage withdrawal methods.

:'''Constant-dollar'''
::&lt;u&gt;Disadvantage&lt;/u&gt;: Does not take into account the fluctuations of overall portfolio value. Many people would like to be able to take out a bit more during a big bull market when their portfolio value is climbing. Those same people would also likely feel uncomfortable taking an ever-increasing inflation-adjusted withdrawal during a multi-year bear market.
::&lt;u&gt;Alternative&lt;/u&gt;: Take the market value of your portfolio into account by moving a fixed percentage of your stock allocation over to your bond allocation every year.

:'''Constant-percentage'''
::&lt;u&gt;Disadvantage&lt;/u&gt;: Withdrawal amount may have considerable year-to-year fluctuations.
::&lt;u&gt;Alternative&lt;/u&gt;: Smooth fluctuations by having yearly withdrawals be an average of 7½ years of bond allocation value.

Using this particular example alternative withdrawal method, 7½ years worth of withdrawals are held in bonds, the rest of the portfolio in stocks. Refer to Figure 6. As an example, to match up initial withdrawals and initial portfolio allocations with the graphs relating to the other methods, we will start with a $1,000,000 portfolio. The initial allocation being 70% stocks and 30% bonds. The initial yearly withdrawal being $40,000 (or 4% of initial portfolio value). The 30% in bonds would equate to $300,000 of the portfolio, which would be 7½ years worth of withdrawals, assuming $40,000 being withdrawn each year ($300,000 divided by $40,000 = 7½).

:{| style = "width:500px;"
|+ '''Figure 7: Graph of the alternative combination method Galeno Strategy yearly withdrawals and remaining portfolio value.'''
|-
|align = "center"|[[File:Galeno.jpg|450px]]
|}

In subsequent years, 6% of the stock allocation of the remaining portfolio is sold and moved to the bond allocation. This is done each and every year, and will result in a differing amount being moved each year depending on stock market performance. This is the part of the method that is an alternative to the constant-dollar method not taking into fluctuating account value.

The 6% of the stock allocation that is sold each year is added to the bond allocation. The new yearly withdrawal amount is then figured by dividing the total bond amount by 7½. The fluctuating amount that is moved from stocks to bonds each year is smoothed by having the bond allocation contain 7½ years worth of withdrawals. As stocks go up, the bond allocation will gradually be increased and allow higher yearly withdrawals. Conversely, as stocks go down, the bond allocation will gradually be decreased and slowly result in lower yearly withdrawals. However, since there is a 7½ year buffer of withdrawals in bonds, year-to-year withdrawal amounts are smoothed and do not fluctuate greatly. This is the part of the method that is an alternative to the constant-percentage method having considerable year-to-year fluctuations of withdrawal amounts.

Overall, an alternative method is usually preferred by someone who would like to keep relatively smooth year-to-year withdrawals while also taking into account fluctuations in their overall portfolio value.

===Glide-path allocation===
As mentioned above in the [[#Asset allocation during withdrawal|asset allocation during withdrawal]] section, many people prefer not to keep a static stock/bond allocation throughout their retirement, but to gradually have their portfolio become more conservative by reducing the stock allocation and increasing the bond allocation as they age. However, the rule-of-thumb method where your bond percentage is equal to your age is sometimes seen as a bit too conservative. Another method, similar to the allocations used by some retirement-date funds is to follow a ''glide-path'' allocation change that isn't necessarily directly linear, as is the bonds=age method. Often, a glide-path method will add bonds to the portfolio mix more slowly in the early years before retirement, thus allowing the portfolio more possibility for growth before retirement. Then, after retirement, the glide-path may transition more quickly to a bond-heavy allocation, thus shielding the portfolio from stock market volatility during later retirement years.

Figure 8 below shows a graph comparing the ''(100-age)'' stock allocation and the ''Log(100-age)-1'' glide-path allocation. The blue (100-age) line is linear, changing the allocation by 1% each year. The glide-path allocation changes more slowly in the earlier years, presumably allowing for more portfolio growth during the accumulation years, and then turns quicker towards a more conservative allocation during the retirement years, eventually becoming more conservative and following a 100% bond allocation for age 90 and later.

:{| style = "width:500px;"

|-
|align = "center"|[[File:Logglidepath.jpg|450px]]
|}

As with the similar ''bonds equal age'' method in Figure 5 [[#Constant-percentage (age in bonds |above]], following a glide-path stock/bond allocation allows the overall portfolio to become more conservative each year. The results, shown in Figure 9 below, are similar to the bonds equal age method, but in the time-period shown in the graph, the slower transition to bonds allowed the overall portfolio to grow a bit more, resulting in slightly more money being withdrawn from the portfolio, while retaining a similar volatility.

|}

===1/N withdrawal amounts===
A common issue when using a typical retirement withdrawal method is that the percentage withdrawn usually assumes the worst-case scenario. That is, the recommended percentage is one that, in the past, would have allowed you to weather the storm of the worst bear market, should it have occurred during your period of retirement. While it is generally considered safe and prudent to assume the worst, what often happens during a retirement period is that the markets perform better than the worst-case scenario, thus increasing your portfolio more than may have been forecast in that worst-case scenario - sometimes much more. If one continues to follow a withdrawal method based on their initial portfolio value at retirement, this unexpected growth may result in their leaving a significant amount of money unspent during their retirement. And while it is often a goal to leave some money to children or relatives, people may also wish that they had spent a bit more money while they had the chance.

One method to allow spending more money from the portfolio during the years you expect to draw from it is to not spend a percentage based on the portfolio's value, but rather spend a percentage based on how long you expect the portfolio to last. A simplistic example which assumes no portfolio growth or inflation concerns would be to imagine that you happen to have a million dollars under your mattress that you wish to make last for 10 years. A 'safe' withdrawal rate would then logically be that you could spend 1/10th of the portfolio each year, giving you a steady withdrawal amount of $100,000 each year for the next 10 years.

A 1/N withdrawal method is similar to this. 'N' being equal to the number of years you need to draw on the portfolio. Each year the 'N' number is readjusted, resulting in a higher percentage being withdrawn from the portfolio. Normally, withdrawing a higher percentage is considered possibly unsafe, as it may result in the portfolio being eventually depleted. However, using a 1/N withdrawal method typically assumes spending the entire portfolio, so large withdrawal percentages aren't a concern. Suppose you had one year to live, then what would a 'safe' withdrawal percentage be? A typical 4%? No, since you know the portfolio only has to last one year, then that means you can, over the course of that year, withdraw 100% of the portfolio.

The N number is readjusted each year, meaning that for a portfolio that you wish to draw from for 20 years would allow a 1/20th of the total portfolio value to be withdrawn the first year, 1/19th the second, and so on. Figure 9 shows a graph of withdrawals over a 37-year period that is the same as shown in the other graphs in this article. One big difference you may notice in this graph is that while the amounts withdrawn are similar to other methods in the early years, the amounts grow rapidly and huge as time goes on. This is due to the fact that with a know expiration date of the portfolio, larger and larger percentages are withdrawn. In order to keep the same Y-axis size as the other graphs in this article, Figure 9 also shows yearly withdrawals only up to $400,000, but in actuality, over the time period in Figure 9, the last eight years all allowed for withdrawals over $400,000, and, in fact, ended in the last year with a withdrawal amount of nearly $600,000, clearly the highest of any method, albeit at the expense of leaving no remaining portfolio.

:{| style = "width:500px;"
|+'''Figure 10: Graph of ''1/N'' of portfolio value yearly withdrawals and remaining portfolio value. Stock percentage decreased each year according to a ''Log(100-age)-1'' glide-path.'''
|-
|align = "center"|[[File:Logoneovern.jpg|450px]]
|}

Now you may have noticed in the last paragraph the one potential monkey-wrench in a 1/N withdrawal method - the N number (i.e. how long you will live) can't be forecast with perfect accuracy. It's all well and good to plan on needing to withdraw from your portfolio for 27 years, but if you spend it all down in that time and then happen to live 28 years, that's certainly going to be a problem! This problem can be solved by considering the 1/N withdrawal amount to be a maximum for the particular year, as in "I can withdraw ''up to'' 1/N this year". Since the withdrawal amounts using this method, or any similar method which uses up the portfolio, can become so large, it is quite easy to spend less than the full amount, thus preserving a portion of the portfolio for potential years beyond 'N'. So while this method, like the others, still involves making some assumptions about the future, it can result in your being able to withdraw much more from your portfolio during retirement, as long as you don't plan on leaving a large legacy.

      <text bytes="5306" sha1="fbqe2ujknjemxs5399jwfxddvvhmqpw" xml:space="preserve">'''{{PAGENAME}}''' poses several challenges, such as restrictions on withdrawals from tax-advantaged accounts and more retirement years. This page lists some considerations for anyone thinking of retiring early.

==Challenges==

*Savings - you have fewer years to earn a retirement nest egg, and will have to stretch that nest egg over more years than a normal retiree, necessitating a lower [[#Safe_withdrawal_rates|withdrawal rate]]. Having less time for your nest egg to grow means a larger percentage will be contributions, as opposed to investment earnings, when you retire.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;For example, if you work for 40 years saving $20,000/year and earning a 5% real (after-inflation) return, you will have about $2.4M (=FV(0.05,40,-20000). If you make the same assumptions but retire after working only 20 years, you will have about $661k, only 27% of the former amount despite working 50% as long. Using a lower safe withdrawal rate for early retirement (for example, 3.5% rather than 4%) widens the income gap even further.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Health insurance - most investors get their health insurance through their employer, but you will have to purchase a health insurance plan in the retail market.
*Lack of [[Social Security]] - while normal retirees can begin collecting Social Security between 62 and 70, early retirees will have to fund their retirement for years or decades with no Social Security income.
*Access to retirement accounts without penalty - you will need to plan more and take special steps to access money inside retirement accounts before age 59½ without paying a penalty; see [[#Withdrawing_from_your_portfolio|below]].

==Traditional versus Roth decision==
{{Main|Traditional versus Roth}}

If you plan to retire early (before age 55-60), the traditional versus Roth decision tends to favor traditional (also known as pre-tax) for these reasons:

*Early retirees tend to have a larger spread between income while working and income in retirement, because they need to save a higher percentage of their income, and stretch that savings over a longer period of time. This spread makes the tax rate arbitrage between working years and retirement even bigger, and this arbitrage favors traditional accounts.
*Roth accounts tend to have less favorable early distribution rules than traditional. For example, a [[substantially equal periodic payments]] (SEPP) plan from a Roth account will waive the early withdrawal penalties, but withdrawn growth will still be taxed. This is not as good as a traditional account, where withdrawals are fully taxable but contributions were tax-free. 
*Early retirees tend to have higher medical expenses, because they do not get health insurance through an employer. These medical expenses are tax-deductible, and so can be effectively paid for tax-free with traditional withdrawals.
*There is less time for the [[Traditional_versus_Roth#Maxing_out_your_retirement_accounts|maxing out your retirement accounts]] effect to work in favor of Roth.

==Withdrawing from your portfolio==
{{Main|Early withdrawal}}

There are several ways to withdraw from your portfolio without incurring the 10% penalty applicable to retirement accounts.

* Withdraw from a taxable account.
* Use [[substantially equal periodic payments]].
* Withdraw of contributions and conversion amounts from a [[Roth IRA]]. Note that contributions can be withdrawn penalty free at any time while a conversion amount must stay in a Roth IRA for five years since the first day of the year in which a conversion is done.
* Use a [[457(b)]]. Non-rollover contributions to 457(b) are exempt from the early withdrawal penalty. 
* Withdraw from a [[401(k)]] at age 55. If you leave the company offering the 401(k) plan at age 55 or later, you do not have to pay the 10% penalty to withdrawal an amount from your 401(k). See [[Rule of 55]] for details.

==Safe withdrawal rates==

You may need to re-evaluate [[safe withdrawal rates]] (SWR) if you are retiring early. [http://www.firecalc.com/ FIRECalc] shows that withdrawing 4% of the initial portfolio value plus inflation adjustments in 49 subsequent years (for a total of 50 years) results in the success rate of 85.1% using the default configuration. Running the same scenario with the 3.5% initial withdrawal rate results in the success rate of 98.9%.

On the other hand, the SWR logic may be uncertain for early retirees. Early retirees often have some level of flexibility in their spending (for example, using a [[Introduction_to_retirement_spending_models#Dual_budget_models | dual budget]]), and in their income (point jobs or part-time jobs remain a possibility), making them good candidates for variable [[withdrawal methods]]. This could allow higher withdrawal rates, but without taking undue risks.

      <text bytes="15074" sha1="ea1hdolvlcrv7jxrf5v7filxms5s3r9" xml:space="preserve">'''{{PAGENAME}} (VPW)''' is a method which adapts portfolio withdrawal amounts to the retiree's retirement horizon, [[Asset allocation|asset allocation]], and portfolio returns during retirement. It combines the best ideas of the constant-dollar, constant-percentage, and 1/N [[Withdrawal methods|withdrawal methods]] to allow the retiree to spend most of the portfolio using ''return-adjusted'' withdrawals. By adapting withdrawals to market returns, VPW will never prematurely deplete the portfolio.

The VPW method uses an increasing percentage to determine withdrawals from a portfolio during retirement. Each year, the withdrawal is determined by multiplying that year's percentage by the current portfolio balance at the time of withdrawal.

The VPW method and spreadsheets were collaboratively developed and improved by a group of Bogleheads&amp;reg;.&lt;ref&gt;VPW was developed in the {{forum post|t=120430|title=Variable Percentage Withdrawal}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[#VPW_Accumulation_And_Retirement_Worksheet | VPW Accumulation And Retirement Worksheet]] calculates ''variable portfolio contributions'', during accumulation, and ''variable portfolio withdrawals'', during retirement, while taking into account current and future pensions with and without cost-of-living adjustments.

The [[#Backtesting Spreadsheet | VPW Backtesting Spreadsheet]] contains two data sets: U.S. (1871-2022)&lt;ref&gt;[[Simba's backtesting spreadsheet|Simba's backtesting spreadsheet]], Bogleheads wiki.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Shiller, [http://www.econ.yale.edu/~shiller/data.htm long term stock, bond, interest rate and consumption data since 1871].&lt;/ref&gt; and Canada (1970-2022)&lt;ref&gt;Libra Investment Management, [http://www.libra-investments.com/re01.htm returns spreadsheet].&lt;/ref&gt;.

==How to use variable percentage withdrawals during retirement==

VPW is best used in conjunction with guaranteed base income from [[Social Security]]&lt;ref&gt;Social Security benefits can be estimated using the Social Security Administration [https://www.ssa.gov/planners/retire/AnypiaApplet.html Online Calculator] or using the [[Tools_and_calculators#Personal_finance_toolbox | personal finance toolbox]] (macros don't need to be activated for estimating Social Security benefits).&lt;/ref&gt;, a pension (if any), and (if necessary) a SPIA&lt;ref name="spia" group="note"&gt;[[Immediate fixed annuity|Single Premium Immediate Annuity]] with fixed payments for life.&lt;/ref&gt; (possibly with annual cost-of-living adjustments).

Portfolio withdrawals are preferably calculated [[#With_the_VPW_Accumulation_And_Retirement_Worksheet | with the VPW Accumulation And Retirement Worksheet]]. Users who don't want to use a spreadsheet can calculate portfolio withdrawals [[#With_the_VPW_table | with the VPW table]] instead.

===With the VPW Accumulation And Retirement Worksheet===
====Steps====
# Open the [[#VPW_Accumulation_And_Retirement_Worksheet | worksheet]].
# Click on the '''Instructions''' tab and read its content.
# Click on the '''Retirement''' tab and:
## '''Each year''':
### Enter (or update) your '''Age''' (or, for a couple, the age of the younger spouse), '''Portfolio Balance''', '''Portfolio Allocation''', and the desired withdrawal frequency (annual, quarterly, or monthly).
###* Note that it is important to update the Age and Portfolio Balance, every year of retirement, as they change.
### Enter (or update) the '''Monthly Payment''' of all '''current and future pensions''', including '''Social Security'''.
###* Note that it is important to update monthly pension payments every year when they change due to cost-of-living adjustments.
### On the chosen frequency, '''withdraw the suggested amount''' and, once during the year, ''rebalance'' your portfolio.
###* Note that the suggested withdrawal amount changes every year as soon as the age and portfolio balance are updated.
## Every few years, you should ''review'' your overall retirement plan.
## At age 80, if you're still alive, it's important to consider using part (but not all) of your remaining portfolio to buy a SPIA&lt;ref name="spia" group="note"/&gt; (possibly with annual cost-of-living adjustments) so that the estimated '''Income Floor After 100''' is sufficient to live comfortably, independently of future portfolio withdrawals. This aims to reduce financial risks associated with living past age 100.
## The withdrawal percentage stops growing when it reaches 10%.
The [[#VPW_Accumulation_And_Retirement_Worksheet | worksheet]] provides for missing payments between retirement and the start of pensions as part of its suggested withdrawal amounts. There's '''no''' need for managing a high-interest savings account or [[CD]] ladder to provide these payments.

====Detailed Example====
A detailed illustration of how to use the the ''VPW Accumulation And Retirement Worksheet'' during retirement to generate monthly income is presented in {{forum post|t=284519|title=A Simple Bogleheads Retirement Using Variable Percentage Withdrawals (VPW Forward Test)}}.

===With the VPW table===
# To simplify calculations when using the [[#VPW_Table | VPW Table]] with a pen and paper, missing payments between retirement and the start of a pension such as Social Security (possibly delayed to age 70&lt;ref name=ForumThread102509&gt;{{forum post|t=102609|title=Delay Social Security to age 70 and Spend more money at 62}}.&lt;/ref&gt;) can be provided by using a simple high-interest savings account or a [[certificate of deposit]] (CD) ladder. For the purposes of VPW calculations, the money set aside in this savings account or CD ladder should '''not''' be considered as part of the portfolio.
# The following procedure should be repeated '''each year''' of retirement:
## Lookup the '''withdrawal percentage''' for your age (or, for a couple, the age of the younger spouse) and the planned asset allocation of your portfolio for the upcoming year in the table below. (For example, a 65-years old retiree with a 30% Stocks / 70% Bonds portfolio would find '''4.4%''' on line 65 under the appropriate column).
##*Note that the ''withdrawal percentage'' changes every year. It must be looked up, as your age has increased by one since the previous year.
## Multiply the current balance of your portfolio by the looked up percentage to calculate the '''withdrawal amount'''. (For example, if the portfolio Balance is $1,200,000 and the percentage is 4.4%, the withdrawal amount is $52,800).
##* Note that the ''withdrawal amount'' changes every year. It must be recalculated because both the ''portfolio balance'' and the ''withdrawal percentage'' have changed since the previous year.
## Withdraw the '''withdrawal amount''' and ''rebalance'' your portfolio.
# Every few years, you should ''review'' your overall retirement plan.
# Around age 80, if you're still alive, it is important to consider using part (but not all) of your remaining portfolio to buy a SPIA&lt;ref name="spia" group="note"/&gt; (possibly with annual cost-of-living adjustments) so that total ''non-portfolio'' income (including Social Security, pension, and other lifelong income) is sufficient to live comfortably, independently of future portfolio withdrawals. This aims to reduce financial risks associated with living past age 100.
# It is suggested to limit the withdrawal percentage to no more than 10%.

===Compatibility===
The spreadsheet is developed using the open-source ''LibreOffice Calc'' software, available [http://www.libreoffice.org/ here]. As a result, some compatibility issues may arise when using other spreadsheet products.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Details on LibreOffice calc can be found [http://www.libreoffice.org/discover/calc/ here]. Another open-source spreadsheet is from [http://www.openoffice.org/ Apache OpenOffice]&lt;/ref&gt;
====Microsoft Excel====
*''Microsoft Excel'' may raise an '''Office File Validation''' security error. This is because the spreadsheet was not built using ''Microsoft'' software; it was built using ''OpenOffice Calc'' and saved as ''Microsoft Excel'' format. Consequently, Excel raises a warning to the user. This error can be safely ignored.
* There is a difference in the way Excel and LibreOffice Calc displays charts. Excel does a nicer job.

      <text bytes="14037" sha1="rljtgvbkiqq0k9dj9ek90gzce50y0lr" xml:space="preserve">'''{{PAGENAME}} (ADD)''' is a percentage withdrawal method that reduces the risk of withdrawal volatility. It can be used as an extension of either [[Withdrawal methods#Constant-percentage|constant percentage withdrawal]] or [[Variable percentage withdrawal|Variable percentage withdrawal]]. To manage short term withdrawal volatility, ADD uses smoothing of the asset. For medium term, it uses an increase cap. For long term, it uses a reserve.  

Each year, the regular withdrawal is determined by the smoothed value of the fund. The regular withdrawal is capped if there was excessive return on asset. A reserve withdrawal is determined to maintain 95% of previous high water mark withdrawals.

==Spreadsheet compatibility==
The spreadsheet is relatively heavy. It may take a while to load (5 min). The spreadsheet is developed using the Excel. It is also tested using google sheet for compatibility. As a result, some compatibility issues may arise when using other spreadsheet products.

|}
==Reserve==
ADD set aside 25% for provision for adverse deviation. This reserve will then be used if regular withdrawal falls below 95% of the high water mark of prior withdrawal. A maximum reserve withdrawal of 10% is established to prevent reserve fund depletion. The objective is to allow withdrawal drops during market downturn up to a predetermined level. If market never recovers, further cuts must be made. We may want to see 5% (100%-95%) of the yearly regular withdrawal as a bonus which may not be available next year.  Any excessive reserve can be used for any emergencies without worrying too much about it repercussion.

Ex: 
* Highest prior withdrawal = 50,000$
* Current regular withdrawal = 40,000$
* Reserve withdrawal = 7,500$ = 50,000 * 95% - 40,000
==Capping==
ADD caps the withdrawal or expected withdrawal based on last year. The cap serves as a protection against adverse deviation in the middle terms. Different caps levels are used for before, on and after retirement. During prolong economic growth the cap increase by 1% for each previous year cap. 

Ex: 
* Prior regular withdrawal = 50,000$
* Current cap regular withdrawal = 52,500$ = 50,000 * 105%

==Smoothing==
ADD smooths the short-term withdrawal by doing a [[linear smoothing]] (similar to moving average) of the average fund value over the last 5 years, adjusted for inflation. This smoothed market value can be considered as the average market value over the last 5 years. Short term fluctuations are delayed through the following years. If market goes up and down during the period, the smoothed value reduces some short-term volatility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.dropbox.com/s/1r214t09ub6j6mg/AccumulationDecumulationStrategyV1.4.pdf |title=Accumulation-Dynamic Decumulation study |date=  |website= |publisher=  |access-date= |last=Leblanc |first=Patrice |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
We should not only look at decumulation, but also at the accumulation phased. By leveraging our knowledge of the past, we lessen retirement date risk and sequence of return risk. Retiring before or after a crash should not produces drastically different withdrawal. Instead, decumulation strategy should be long term based without too much focus on current market value. Decumulation strategy has to endure many decades of market fluctuation. 

While smoothing and increase cap may be and are used as “timing market strategy”, the purpose in this strategy is not to time the market. Smoothing is used to reduce the volatility of withdrawal. Increase cap and the reserve are used to create a provision for adverse deviation. The unsmoothed, uncapped and without reserve may provide more cash flow than the alternative. With these strategies, we try to reduce withdrawal volatility regardless of market condition.

Inflation used to be a greater risk than it is now. Most federal banks around the world have pledged for low inflation target (&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/5D58E72F066A4DBDA80BBA659C55F774.htm |title=What is an acceptable level of inflation? |date= July 25, 2011 |website= |publisher= US Federal Reserve System |access-date= |quote=}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bankofcanada.ca/core-functions/monetary-policy/ |title=Monetary Policy |date=  |website= |publisher= Bank of Canada|access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;). This strategy default focuses on nominal terms. However, there’s an option to adjust for real terms. 

==Parameter==
There are four major decisions to make: 
* Asset allocation (Data tab cell B21): This should be based of your need, ability and willingness to take on risk. 
* Withdrawal pattern (Data tab cell I17): Select Constant Percentage Withdrawal or Variable Percentage Withdrawal. CPW allows for endowment like cash flow which never depletes the funds and may have more funds at death than at retirement.  VPW instead tries to withdraw increasing amount of money through retirement. This allows using most of the available funds prior to death, but it leaves less for bequest motives. 
* Protecting against inflation (Data tab cell J26): Retiree are known to need less year to year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://business.financialpost.com/personal-finance/family-finance/why-your-retirement-income-doesnt-need-to-keep-pace-with-inflation |title=Why your retirement income doesn’t need to keep pace with inflation |date= October 21, 2015 |website= |publisher= Financial Post|access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the current target inflation (2%), it is reasonable to not protect against inflation and enjoy greater withdrawal now and less latter. If you rather enjoy more or the same real value later, than this parameter should be set to “On”. 
* Withdrawal percentage (Data tab cell H20, J20): It depends on the previous three decisions and on risk tolerance. For ADD+CPW, 5.5-6.5% provided low to medium risk without inflation protection. With inflation protection, 3.5-4.0% provided low to medium risk. For ADD+VPW, we multiply the VPW prescribed withdrawal rate by 100-130% to provide low to medium risk without inflation protection. With inflation protection, the multiplication factor is 70%-90% to provide low to medium risk. While these seem high withdrawal rates, the effective withdrawal will be about 75% of it due to the 25% reserve. 
Other parameters can be found under the advance parameter tab. 

===ADD manual process===
ADD is best used in conjunction with guaranteed base income from [[Social Security]], pensions, and, if necessary, inflation-indexed [[Immediate fixed annuity|Single Premium Immediate Annuity]] (SPIA). 

Missing payments, between retirement and the start of Social Security pension, can be provided by using a simple [[CD]] ladder. For the purposes of ADD calculations, the money set aside in this [[CD]] ladder should '''not''' be considered as part of the portfolio.

It has been suggested to delay the Social Security pension to age 70 to increase base income in {{Forum post|t=102609|title=Delay Social Security to age 70 and Spend more money at 62}}.

# Split the retirement fund into regular fund (75%) and reserve (25%). 
# The following procedure should be repeated '''each year''' before retirement and after retirement:
## Calculate the smoothed regular fund value
## Multiply the '''regular withdrawal percentage''' by the smoothed regular fund value. Use the '''regular withdrawal percentage''' based of either [[Variable percentage withdrawal]](prescribed withdrawal rate * 70% to 130%). or [[Withdrawal methods#Constant-percentage|constant percentage withdrawal]](3.5% to 6.5%). 
## Multiply last year withdrawal or expected withdrawal by the increase cap to limit the previous result. If before retirement, use a cap of 115%. If at retirement, use a cap of 108%. If after retirement, use a cap of 105%. 
## Find the maximum previous withdrawal after retirement.  
## Multiply maximum previous withdrawal multiply by reserve protection (95%). 
## Subtract the previous result over the regular withdrawal. The difference is the reserve withdrawal amount. 
## Cap this reserve withdrawal amount to 10% of the reserve fund. 
## Withdraw the '''withdrawal amount''' from the regular fund, ''' reserve withdrawal amount''' from the reserve fund and ''rebalance'' your portfolio.
# Every few years, you should ''review'' your overall retirement plan.
# Around age 80, if you're still alive, it is important to consider using part (but not all) of your remaining portfolio to buy an ''inflation-indexed'' Single Premium Immediate Annuity (SPIA), so that total ''non-portfolio'' income (including Social Security, pension, and other lifelong income) is sufficient to live comfortably, independently of future portfolio withdrawals. This aims to reduce the financial risks associated with living past age 100.
# It is suggested to limit the withdrawal percentage to no more than 10%, after buying the inflation-indexed SPIA.

==Amortization==

===Understanding amortization===

Amortization is the process of converting the value of a lump sum into a series of payments over time. Most people encounter it when they take out a mortgage or car loan. Amortization is used to calculate the monthly payment required to pay back the loan. The value of the monthly payments has to be made equal to the value of the initial loan.

If the interest rate is zero, amortization is just simple division: If $100,000 has to be paid back over 10 years, then the payment is $100,000 ÷ 10 = $10,000 per year.

But if the interest rate is positive, as is usually the case, then the payment in the above example would have to be more than $10,000 per year. That's because $10,000 in the future is worth less than $10,000 today. This is referred to as the time value of money. If the interest is 5% per year, then $10,000 today is worth:

* &lt;math&gt;$10,000*1.05^1=$10,500&lt;/math&gt; one year from now
* &lt;math&gt;$10,000*1.05^2=$11,025&lt;/math&gt; two years from now

and so on. We will have to adjust for the differences in value. The amortization formula makes the necessary adjustments and tells us that if the interest rate is 5% per year, then the payments will have to be $12,950 per year for the next ten years for the total value of the payments to be equal in value to the $100,000 that was borrowed today.

==Amortization based withdrawal==

To calculate portfolio withdrawals, enter the following inputs in the ABW calculator ([[#ABW calculator|below]]):

* &lt;math&gt;P=&lt;/math&gt; current portfolio value
* &lt;math&gt;n=&lt;/math&gt; number of years over which withdrawals are to be spread out
* &lt;math&gt;r=&lt;/math&gt; expected return of the portfolio.

===Example===

A 65 year old retiree with a $1 million portfolio expected to earn 3% per year and seeking to spread out withdrawals over 36 years (ages 65 to 100), would enter &lt;math&gt;P=$1,000,000, n=36, r=3%&lt;/math&gt;. The amortization calculator says that this retiree can withdraw $44,470 per year. This means that if the actual rate of return of the portfolio remains constant at 3% per year and the retiree withdraws $44,470 every year, then the portfolio will be fully depleted after 36 years.

===Real vs nominal rate of return===

If a real (inflation adjusted) rate of return is used, the withdrawal strategy becomes automatically adjusted for inflation. In the above example, if the real rate of return is 3%, the retiree will be able to take out $44,470 (inflation adjusted) each year. If instead, the retiree enters a nominal interest rate of 5%, the calculator says that they can take out $60,434 per year. But that's in nominal dollars, so real consumption will decline each year by the inflation rate. In practice, it is strongly recommended to use a real rate of return.

===Update and adapt===

Withdrawals are recalculated each year with updated information about portfolio value, expected rate of return, and number of years left. This allows withdrawals to continually adapt to new information and mitigates the impact of past incorrect assumptions. Amortization spreads the course correction required across all remaining years, thereby minimizing the impact on any one year.

====Example====

Consider what happens in our earlier example if, instead of gaining 3% as expected, the portfolio actually loses 10%. The shortfall relative to expectations is &lt;math&gt;(1-.10)/(1+.03)-1=-12.6%&lt;/math&gt;. Our retiree had expected to start age 66 with $984,196 in the portfolio. Instead, the portfolio contains only $859,977, which is 12.6% less. Consider what happens in the following two scenarios:

=====Scenario 1: Expected return stays the same=====
Suppose that the retiree believes that this market drop has not impacted future expected returns, which in the retiree's opinion, remains at 3%. The retiree enters the new reduced portfolio value, &lt;math&gt;P=$859,977&lt;/math&gt;, number of years remaining &lt;math&gt;n=35&lt;/math&gt;, and expected real return &lt;math&gt;r=3%&lt;/math&gt;. The withdrawal is now reduced to $38,857 per year. That is a 12.6% reduction relative to the previously planned withdrawal of $44,470. So the 12.6% portfolio loss is being matched by a 12.6% spending cut across all remaining years.

=====Scenario 2: Expected return increases=====
If the market drop was due to a pure valuation change and the underlying earnings of the portfolio are not impacted, then the retiree might expect a higher rate of return going forward.

If expected return is based on an earnings yield model (e.g. 1/CAPE) for stocks and yield to maturity for bonds, a 12.6% reduction in valuation will result in a higher expected real return of &lt;math&gt;.03/(1-.126)=3.43%&lt;/math&gt;. With the higher expected return, the withdrawal becomes $41,181. That is a reduction of only 7.4% relative to the original plan of $44,470. A 12.6% reduction in the portfolio led to only a 7.4% reduction in income, because the higher expected return partially offset the loss in portfolio value.

So to the extent that market volatility is caused by valuation changes and gets incorporated into expected returns, withdrawals from the portfolio will be less volatile than the portfolio itself.

==Adding a terminal balance==

Instead of fully depleting the portfolio, the amortization can be modified to leave behind a terminal balance. This could be used to fund end of life care or a bequest, or it could simply serve as a general financial cushion. 

In the ABW calculator, enter:
* &lt;math&gt;B=&lt;/math&gt; terminal balance

===Example===

The 65 year old retiree in the earlier example wants to have $200,000 left at the end for a bequest. Enter &lt;math&gt;B=$200,000&lt;/math&gt; in the calculator to get a withdrawal of $41,401 per year. If the actual rate of return matches expectations, then after withdrawing $41,401 for 36 years (ages 65 to 100), the retiree will have $200,000 remaining in the portfolio at the end of age 100.

==Rising or falling withdrawal schedules==

Instead of aiming at a constant withdrawal schedule, some retirees may prefer to aim at a rising or falling withdrawal schedule. Retirees worried about incurring unexpected expenses or generally running out of money in later years may want to use a rising withdrawal schedule - take less early so they can have more later. Those wanting to fund an active early retirement may want to use a declining withdrawal schedule - take more early but have less later. (Note the similarity with savings. This can be viewed as a decision about how much to save in the early retirement years in order to fund late retirement consumption.)

In the ABW calculator, enter:
* &lt;math&gt;g=&lt;/math&gt; rate of growth of the withdrawal schedule

&lt;math&gt;g&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; generates a rising withdrawal schedule, &lt;math&gt;g&lt;0&lt;/math&gt; generates a declining withdrawal schedule, and &lt;math&gt;g=0&lt;/math&gt; generates a constant withdrawal schedule.

===Example===

If the 65 year old retiree in the earlier example wants withdrawals to grow at 1% per year, set &lt;math&gt;g=1%&lt;/math&gt; to get a withdrawal of $38,349. Withdrawals are scheduled to grow 1% per year, rising to $54,325 at age 100.

If instead the retiree wishes to spend more in early retirement and wants withdrawals to fall by 1% per year, set &lt;math&gt;g=-1%&lt;/math&gt; to get a withdrawal of $51,118. Withdrawals are scheduled to fall 1% per year, declining to $35,959 at age 100.

==Asset allocation==

===Fixed asset allocation===

The amortization formula assumes an expected rate of return on the portfolio which stays consistent over the retirement period. This is easier to justify if the retiree plans to maintain a fixed asset allocation (AA). If instead the retiree is planning to change the AA over time (e.g. glide down from 60/40 to 30/70 over the course of the retirement), then the expected return will display more variations over time, skewing the amortization computation. The calculator provided here is not designed for such a case. Entering the average expected return in the calculator may provide a rough estimate, but due to the potential for significant errors, more precise modeling is recommended. If you want to model a strategy with varying asset allocation, see [[Amortization based withdrawal formulas#Allowing_for_non-constant_expected_returns|Allowing for non constant returns]] for the amortization formula with non-constant returns.

===Fixed asset allocation with sub-portfolios===

The portfolio can be divided into multiple sub-portfolios and a different fixed allocation applied to each sub-portfolio.

Suppose the retiree is more risk averse over certain categories of consumption (e.g. food and housing), and less risk averse over other categories (e.g. vacations). The portfolio can be subdivided into a safer portfolio to fund food and housing and a riskier portfolio to fund vacations. The safe portfolio would get a safe fixed AA like 30/70, and the riskier portfolio would get a riskier fixed AA like 80/20. Multiple sub-portfolios could be created to fund different consumption goals, each with a different AA that matches the risk-reward considerations for that goal. Withdrawals would be calculated separately for each sub-portfolio.

An example of a strategy that uses sub-portfolios is the Liability Matched Portfolio (LMP) strategy. The portfolio is divided into a "liability matched portfolio" and a "risk portfolio". The liability matched portfolio has an AA of 0/100 and is used to fund non-negotiable consumption. The risk portfolio is given a riskier AA and is used to fund discretionary "nice to have" consumption.

==Estimating the expected return==

The expected return is the amount of profit or loss an investor can anticipate receiving on an investment. An expected return is calculated by multiplying potential outcomes by the odds of them occurring and then totaling these results.&lt;ref name="investopedia"&gt;[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/expectedreturn.asp Expected Return] - Investopedia&lt;/ref&gt; The expected return can be expanded to analyze a portfolio containing many investments. If the expected return for each investment is known, the portfolio's overall expected return is a weighted average of the expected returns of its components.&lt;ref name="investopedia"/&gt;

The expected return is usually based on historical data and is therefore not guaranteed into the future; however, it does often set reasonable expectations.&lt;ref name="investopedia"/&gt; Some models rely more on current data (e.g. market price).

The ABW calculation requires the user to input the expected rate of return of the portfolio. ABW does not recommend a specific model for this purpose. The user is free to use whatever model of expected return they prefer. Regardless of the method, the user must be aware if the estimate is in real (inflation-adjusted) or nominal (not inflation-adjusted) terms. Examples of models that can be used include:

===Models based on historical returns===

This model uses a fixed value equal to the long-term weighted average of historical results. The weights are the same as the components of the portfolio's asset allocation, applied to historical averages of each market segment of interest. 

For example, the Credit Suisse Global Investment Returns Yearbook provides 120 years of data on stocks, bonds, bills, inflation and currency for 23 national markets and for the world as a whole&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.credit-suisse.com/about-us-news/en/articles/media-releases/credit-suisse-global-investment-returns-yearbook-2020-202002.html Credit Suisse Global Investment Returns Yearbook] - 2020 edition&lt;/ref&gt;. As a rule of thumb, in real (inflation-adjusted) terms, stocks returned approximately 5% worldwide and bonds returned approximately 2%. If your portfolio uses a 60/40 asset allocation, then the expected return would be 5% x 60% + 2% x 40% = 3.8%.

===Models based on current yields===

This model uses a value computed on a periodic basis (e.g. annual) derived from recent yields metrics. Such variable models have historically displayed useful smoothing properties when used in the context of an amortization based withdrawal method, as illustrated in [[#Update_and_adapt|scenario 2 above]]. 

For stocks, the earnings yield E/P (the inverse of a price to earnings ratio P/E) can be used. Given earnings volatility, it is typically preferred to average earnings over a longer time period than just one year. The inverse of the [[P/E#Shiller PE10|Shiller PE10 ratio]] (also known as CAPE) for a given stock market gives an earnings yield that averages earnings over the last 10 years. For the US, [https://www.multpl.com/shiller-pe multpl.com] provides the latest CAPE. For international markets, [https://www.starcapital.de/en/research/stock-market-valuation/ Star Capital] provides a monthly update. Stocks earning yields are real (inflation-adjusted) values.

For bonds, the [[SEC Yield]] can be used. Yields for regular bonds are nominal values and need to be adjusted for expected inflation (e.g. the US Federal Reserve 2% target) to obtain a real value. For [[TIPS]], the SEC Yield is a real value. As bonds yields tend to provide short to mid term expected returns (e.g. a decade at most), it might be beneficial to compute the average of historical returns and current yields.

===Models based on experts estimates===

Multiple well-known expert sources provide expected returns for various market segments, while regularly updating corresponding models. Care should be exercised about the exact nature of such estimates (e.g. real vs. nominal, mid-term vs. long-term, etc.)

As an example, [https://institutional.vanguard.com/VGApp/iip/site/institutional/researchcommentary/article/InvResVEMO2021 Vanguard] and [https://interactive.researchaffiliates.com/asset-allocation#!/?category=Multi-Country&amp;currency=USD&amp;group=all&amp;model=ERYPG&amp;scale=LINEAR&amp;selected=32&amp;terms=REAL&amp;type=Equities Research Affiliates] are often cited as credible sources.

==Extra income and expenses==

Besides their savings portfolio, retirees may have other sources of present or future income such as [[Social Security]], pensions, annuities, rental income, part-time wages and lump sum payouts ("extra income"). Retirees may also plan for exceptional expenses such as college tuition, a lingering home mortgage or long-term care expenses that may require funds beyond what is provided by regular budgeting ("extra expenses"). Such future extra income and expenses can be amortized by computing the present value of such future sums (see Wiki article on calculating present value by discounting future cash flows:  [[Comparing_investments#Present_value|Comparing Investments]]) and converting in an additional series of payments, beyond the regular payment derived from the savings portfolio's balance. It is strongly recommended to perform such computations in real (inflation-adjusted) terms. Funding such additional payments in the short-term can be achieved in different ways, e.g. structuring financial assets according to the retiree's personal risks/rewards goals. ABW is neutral and does not take a position on how best to do it. Below are some of the strategies which can be used:

===Separate sub-portfolio focused approach===

The retiree can choose to keep funds for some or all of the extra income and expenses outside the regular amortization process. They can allocate extra income and budget for extra expenses, separate from the ABW calculation. This is effectively a partitioned portfolio approach where extra income and expenses are being handled in a separate safe sub-portfolio.

A retiree formally pursuing the separate portfolio approach described [[User:Willthrill81/Amortization_based_withdrawal#Fixed_asset_allocation_with_sub-portfolios|earlier]] may find it convenient to use conservative estimates of social security and pensions to fund the safe sub-portfolios. For more complex cases, sizing the sub-portfolio can be achieved by a present value computation of future extra income and expenses (e.g. when using a bonds ladder, use the bonds interest rate to discount future income/expenses). The income streams are typically duration matched. Gaps remaining can be filled with duration matched bonds. Depending on the asset allocation, there may be little to no rebalancing needed in safe sub-portfolios.

===Savings portfolio focused approach===

The retiree funds the additional payments through additional withdrawals from the savings portfolio, while maintaining a fixed asset allocation on the savings portfolio. The discounting and amortization rate used should then be the savings portfolio's expected rate of return. Care should be exercised about the additional burden on your savings portfolio and possible consequences of market crises before steady future income (e.g. SS/Pensions) materializes.

Calculate the extra net income (extra income minus extra expenses) for each year of the planned withdrawal period, using conservative estimates of extra income and exceptional expenses. Calculate its aggregate present value using the portfolio's expected rate of return &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.kitces.com/blog/net-present-value-discount-rate-formula-retirement-plan-pension-lump-sum-or-social-security-breakeven/ Choosing An Appropriate Discount Rate For Retirement Planning Strategies] Michael Kitces, July 2017&lt;/ref&gt;. Calculate amortized additional withdrawals based on such present value, in the same manner as the savings portfolio balance is amortized. Such computation is independent from the portfolio's rebalancing procedure and doesn't change the expected return computation. More information on this approach is available here: [https://www.bogleheads.org/blog/2019/02/01/early-retirement-and-time-value-of-money/ Early Retirement and Time Value of Money], a blog article which comes with a [http://bit.ly/2WuNmvf companion spreadsheet].

===Total portfolio focused approach===

The retiree adds the present value of safe extra net income (extra income minus extra expenses) to the savings portfolio to arrive at the value of the total portfolio. Asset allocation and withdrawal calculations are done on the total portfolio, counting the value of the safe extra net income as a bond. When the withdrawal scheduled for a given year exceeds the extra net income for that year, the difference is withdrawn from the savings portfolio. Conversely, when the withdrawal scheduled for a given year is less than the extra net income for that year, the difference is contributed to the savings portfolio.

Calculate the extra net income (extra income minus extra expenses) for each year of the planned withdrawal period, using conservative estimates of extra income and exceptional expenses. Calculate its aggregate present value using bond interest rates. Add this value to the savings portfolio for all calculations, counting it as a bond. Include it when calculating withdrawals. Include it when calculating the asset allocation of the total portfolio (for rebalancing) and the expected return of the total portfolio (to enter into the amortized payment computation). More information on this approach is available here: [[Total portfolio allocation and withdrawal]].

==ABW calculator==

===Basic calculator===

To calculate current withdrawal, use the Excel spreadsheet [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XOnBaUspLX_oaM2rquTPmLj5AKOm6yxV/view?usp=sharing ABW Calculator].

To simulate withdrawals for a particular sequence of returns, use the Excel spreadsheet [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ugmCh_2a21G2v0TVtjvuuHZt8SXPh3Tl/view?usp=sharing Amortization Based Withdrawal - Simulator].

To simulate withdrawals for 500 randomly generated sequences of returns (Monte Carlo Simulation), use the Excel spreadsheet [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IhGdB3pKU96gVvENWNPNZ5nwHWa21jLW/view?usp=sharing Amortization Based Withdrawal - Monte Carlo Simulator].

The formulas used in the calculator is described in [[Amortization based withdrawal formulas]].

===Advanced calculators===

These calculators expand the basic functionality to incorporate extra income and expenses.

An Excel spreadsheet that incorporates extra income and expenses using the "total portfolio focused approach" is available on Google Drive: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1n4eGYbejArntB6IvuhcSycyh41bxaGbd/view?usp=sharing Total portfolio allocation and withdrawal].

==Amortization formula==

If &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is the lump sum value, &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is the amount paid over &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; periods, and &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is the interest rate, then

: &lt;math&gt;
A = \frac{P*r}{1-\frac{1}{(1+r)^n}} \;
&lt;/math&gt;

Note that this formula assumes that the periodic payment &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; begins next period, not immediately. The lump sum &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is the value today (period 0), and the periodic payments &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; are being made in periods 1 through &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. This is natural in the context of a loan: the loan is taken out today and the repayments only start next period.

The formula does not work for &lt;math&gt;r=0&lt;/math&gt;. You can input &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; close to zero in the above formula to get an approximate answer. Or you can use simple division to get the exact answer.

In Excel, the PMT function can be used for this calculation:

: &lt;math&gt;
A=\operatorname{PMT}(r,n,-P,0,0)
&lt;/math&gt;

==Amortization based withdrawal formula==

To calculate portfolio withdrawals, set &lt;math&gt;P=&lt;/math&gt; current portfolio value, &lt;math&gt;n=&lt;/math&gt; number of years over which withdrawals are to be spread out, and &lt;math&gt;r=&lt;/math&gt; expected return of the portfolio.

The amortization formula above assumes that payments begin next year, not immediately. If withdrawals are to start this year, the formula needs to be divided by &lt;math&gt;(1+r)&lt;/math&gt;:

: &lt;math&gt;
A = \frac{P*r}{1-\frac{1}{(1+r)^n}}*\frac{1}{1+r} \;
&lt;/math&gt;

In Excel, the PMT function can be used for this calculation:

: &lt;math&gt;
A=\operatorname{PMT}(r,n,-P,0,1)
&lt;/math&gt;

==Adding a terminal balance==

Instead of fully depleting the portfolio, the amortization can be modified to leave behind a terminal balance. If the target terminal balance is &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; dollars, withdrawal is:

: &lt;math&gt;
A = \frac{(P-\frac{B}{(1+r)^n})*r}{1-\frac{1}{(1+r)^n}}*\frac{1}{1+r} \;
&lt;/math&gt;

In Excel, the PMT function can be used for this calculation:

: &lt;math&gt;
A=\operatorname{PMT}(r,n,-P,B,1)
&lt;/math&gt;

==Allowing for rising or falling withdrawal schedules==

Instead of a constant withdrawal schedule, the amortization can be modified to generate a withdrawal schedule that grows at a rate of &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; per year. First year's withdrawal is:

: &lt;math&gt;
A = \frac{(P-\frac{B}{(1+r)^n})*(r-g)}{1-(\frac{1+g}{1+r})^n}*\frac{1}{1+r} \;
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;g&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; generates a rising withdrawal schedule, &lt;math&gt;g&lt;0&lt;/math&gt; generates a declining withdrawal schedule, and &lt;math&gt;g=0&lt;/math&gt; generates a constant withdrawal schedule.

The formula does not work for &lt;math&gt;r=g&lt;/math&gt;. You can input &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; close to &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; in the above formula to get an approximate answer. Or you can use simple division to get the exact answer.

In Excel, the PMT function can be used for this calculation:

: &lt;math&gt;
A=\operatorname{PMT}(\frac{1+r}{1+g}-1,n,-P,\frac{B}{(1+g)^n},1)
&lt;/math&gt;

==Allowing for non-constant expected returns==

Instead of a constant expected return, the amortization can be modified to allow for expected returns that vary over time. This will happen for example when the asset allocation changes over time.

Suppose the expected return between year 1 (now) and year 2 is &lt;math&gt;r_1&lt;/math&gt;, between year 2 and year 3 is &lt;math&gt;r_2&lt;/math&gt;,..., between year &lt;math&gt;n-1&lt;/math&gt; and year &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;r_{n-1}&lt;/math&gt;. First year's withdrawal is:

: &lt;math&gt;
A = \frac{P-\frac{B}{(1+r_1)...(1+r_{n-1})}}{1+\frac{1+g}{1+r_1}+\frac{(1+g)^2}{(1+r_1)(1+r_2)}+...+\frac{(1+g)^{n-1}}{(1+r_1)...(1+r_{n-1})}}\;
&lt;/math&gt;

==Net Present Value (NPV) calculations==

To include future income in the amortization, some methods add the net present value (NPV) of future net income to the savings portfolio.

Future net income constitutes a cash flow, which is a stream of payments over time. The payments could be positive (inflow, as in income) or negative (outflow, as in expenses). The NPV of a cash flow, discounted by the rate &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;, is the lump sum amount required today that, if it grows at the rate &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;, can reproduce the cash flow.

Suppose the cash flow is &lt;math&gt;Y_0&lt;/math&gt; in period &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; (present), &lt;math&gt;Y_1&lt;/math&gt; in period &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;Y_2&lt;/math&gt; in period &lt;math&gt;2,...,Y_T&lt;/math&gt; in period &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;. If the discount rate is &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;, then the NPV of this cash flow is given by

: &lt;math&gt;
NPV = Y_0 + \frac{Y_1}{(1+r)^1} + \frac{Y_2}{(1+r)^2} + ... + \frac{Y_T}{(1+r)^T}
&lt;/math&gt;

In Excel, this calculation can be performed using the NPV function

: &lt;math&gt;
\operatorname{NPV}(r,Y_0:Y_T)*(1+r)
&lt;/math&gt;

or the XNPV function

: &lt;math&gt;
\operatorname{XNPV}(r,Y_0:Y_T,D_0:D_T)
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;D_0:D_T&lt;/math&gt; contains the dates of the cash flow &lt;math&gt;Y_0:Y_T&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text bytes="8557" sha1="cmi9x6gmi8lx1m5459dfxx9p8vs8f2x" xml:space="preserve">'''{{PAGENAME}}''' (TPAW) describes the "total portfolio" approach to asset allocation and withdrawal.

The total portfolio approach means that the present value of future savings and retirement income, valued using the safe bond rate, is counted as safe bonds in the portfolio. A fixed asset allocation is maintained on this "total portfolio." Retirement withdrawals are calculated by amortizing the total portfolio over retirement years ([[amortization based withdrawal]]).

The advantage of the total portfolio approach is that total risk is kept consistent from year to year. This has two benefits: 

# Risk is spread more evenly across years, reducing the total risk that the retiree would need to take to achieve a given expected return. 
# It prevents surprises like risk increasing unexpectedly as the real value of a pension declines and the retiree relies more heavily on the savings portfolio.

==Theory==

=== Relation to Merton's strategy ===
The allocation and withdrawal strategy of TPAW aligns with the optimal allocation and withdrawal derived in Merton (1969)&lt;ref&gt;Merton, R. C. (1969). "Lifetime Portfolio Selection under Uncertainty: the Continuous-Time Case". ''The Review of Economics and Statistics''. '''51''' (3): 247–257&lt;/ref&gt;. This spreadsheet shows the link between the two strategies. You can enter the inputs for Merton's strategy and obtain the corresponding inputs for TPAW:

* Merton's inputs matched to TPAW inputs: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wj3hM-BCL0U0FOd9_nf-uz3_Vq0_1Jy4/edit?usp=sharing&amp;ouid=102598494905177370665&amp;rtpof=true&amp;sd=true Excel] or [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e1GUsfDn6CHEh8XpTyDJN0q1DmWz7UDIW2xHhUHZOyg/edit?usp=sharing Google Sheets]

=== Deviations from Merton's strategy ===
TPAW deviates from Merton's strategy in the following ways:

* ''No borrowing'': While Merton assumes borrowing, TPAW assumes no borrowing. If Merton's strategy calls for borrowing to invest (that is, an asset allocation of more than 100% stocks, likely early on in a career), TPAW uses an an asset allocation of 100% stocks instead. And if Merton's strategy calls for borrowing to consume (a possibility in early retirement before pensions begin), TPAW only withdraws whatever is available in the savings portfolio.

* ''Extra withdrawals'': Merton's model assumes no extra spending needs in any year. TPAW allows the user to schedule extra withdrawals in desired years through the "essential expenses funded by safe bonds" and the "extra withdrawals funded by risk portfolio" columns.
* ''No savings strategy'': Besides the optimal withdrawal strategy during retirement, Merton's model also gives the optimal savings strategy when working. TPAW takes savings as given and does not model the savings decision.

===Model with borrowing===
This spreadsheet implements TPAW with borrowing, which brings it closer to Merton's strategy. The assumption that you can borrow as much as you want simplifies calculations. Answers can be obtained with formulas and do not require simulations (for example, what is the probability of withdrawals falling below $40,000 at age 70?). But it is not directly implementable in a world with borrowing constraints, so be careful when using the spreadsheet to understand if and when borrowing is being assumed and the consequences of not being able to borrow as assumed. The larger the savings portfolio is relative to future income, the less likely the model is to require borrowing. The model is most likely to call for borrowing (to invest) in early career when the savings portfolio is at its lowest and future savings is at its highest. For people with large pensions relative to savings, it might also call for borrowing (to consume) in early retirement before Social Security and pensions start. You should use the "Planner with Monte Carlo Simulation" above to ensure that your strategy will work well without borrowing. If you do not want to explore the theory behind TPAW and are looking for the quickest route to an implementable strategy that does not involve borrowing, you can ignore this spreadsheet and rely solely on the "Planner with Monte Carlo Simulation" above to devise your strategy.

===Sequence of Return Risk===
Sequence of return risk is the risk that poor returns occur when a savings portfolio is large (typically around the start of retirement) and are not fully compensated by good returns that occur when the savings portfolio is small (typically early career and late retirement).  This leads to concern that a market crash right around retirement can permanently damage a retirement because portfolios are at their peak value and very sensitive to returns. TPAW manages this risk by maintaining a fixed asset allocation on the total portfolio and employing amortization based withdrawals. This results in a strategy that is well diversified across time, making the outcome less sensitive to the timing of returns. A crash and subsequent recovery would have no harmful effect on retirement even if it occurred just prior to retirement when the savings portfolio is at its peak. During retirement, no matter when the crash occurs, the loss would be limited to reduced income during the depressed years. The income will recover fully if and when the market recovers. There would be no permanent damage to the portfolio that persists after the market has recovered.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' data describing typical retiree spending patterns are an important resource for the retirement planning process.  Careful analysis of such data provides important guidance for individuals, financial planners, economists, as well as for developers of retirement planning software.

The two major sources of retirement spending data for U.S. retirees come from the annual U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' ''Consumer Expenditure Survey'' and from the biennial ''Health and Retirement Study'' survey conducted by the Survey Research Center at the University of Michigan.  Both of these survey datasets allow estimates of retirement spending for the median U.S. retiree as well as for retirees from a range of lower and higher income subgroups.  Since both surveys have been conducted repeatedly over long time periods, they allow changes in retirement spending patterns over time to be examined.  The ''Health and Retirement Study'' actually follows the &lt;u&gt;same people&lt;/u&gt; over time, in what is known as a ''panel'' design, allowing even more detailed examination of the effects of retirement on individuals.  Examples of such longitudinal studies include spending pattern changes as individuals transition into retirement, and spending changes during recessionary periods as a function of retirement income level.

Retirement spending trends observed for the &lt;u&gt;average&lt;/u&gt; U.S. retiree include the following:

* Spending drops modestly (14%) immediately after retirement, partly due to the cessation of work-related expenses (e.g. special clothing and transportation) and changes in food expenditures.
* Inflation-adjusted spending continues dropping slowly afterwards as retirees age into their late 70s.
* Housing + Related is by far the largest spending category for all age groups.
* Health Care expenses rise with age, but remain substantially lower than housing expenses.
* Increases in health care spending are not sufficient to change the downward trend in total inflation-adjusted spending, at least not until late in retirement.

Studies of retirement spending patterns across racial and income level subgroups reveal measurable heterogeneity in U.S. retirement spending.  Since housing is the largest retirement expense, it is not surprising that such differences are clearly seen in this category.  The size of the typical spending drop upon retirement is inversely related to household wealth (poorer hourseholds exhibiting on average a much larger spending drop).   However not all retirees exhibit a spending drop: about 53% of households exhibit a drop in spending at retirement, another 35% report a negligible change in spending at retirement, while 12% reported an &lt;u&gt;increase&lt;/u&gt; in spending at retirement.

A significant percentage of individuals (25-28%) enter retirement involuntarily. The overwhelming number of involuntary retirements can be traced back to major health difficulties or extended unemployment. For such retirees spending at retirement exhibits a much stronger drop than for the average retiree.


==Importance of retirement spending data==
Access to actual spending data for retirees can be valuable to several categories of people:

* '''Individual Pre-retirees'''.  Individuals planning for their future are often perplexed about how their spending might change as they enter into and progress through retirement.  For them, having access to typical retirement spending data can be extremely helpful in thinking through their own future spending.
* '''Financial Planners'''.  Access to such data assists them in developing retirement plans for their clients that have a better factual basis than anecdotal spending rules based on limited personal experience.
* '''Economists'''.  Without such data they are unable to test the validity of their economic models describing consumer behavior.  Such models often find their way into retirement planning software. &lt;ref&gt;For example, the software [http://www.esplanner.com/ ESPlanner] is based on the economic research published by Prof. Laurence Kotlikoff of Boston University.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Developers of Retirement Planning Software'''.  They need to be confident that the spending input portions of their programs are flexible enough to accommodate a broad socio-economic range of potential users.  Access to retiree spending data allows them to test their software against reality and make improvements where needed.

Most reliable information on U.S. retiree spending is derived from two survey databases: the annual '''Consumer Expenditure Survey''' (CE) and the biennial '''Health and Retirement Study''' (HRS).&lt;ref&gt;There are also a number of smaller surveys that provide insight into pre- and post-retirement spending.  A few of these are also referred to in the text and in these references.&lt;/ref&gt;  These surveys provide very detailed economic data covering a broad range of the U.S. population. Working directly with these databases can be difficult.  It is usually easier to refer to academic research articles that analyze just the portion of the data that is of interest.  The remainder of this article provides an introduction to each survey, presents some representative data for the "average retiree", and also presents some information covering non-average retiree spending patterns.


==U.S. Consumer Expenditure Survey (CE)==
The main source of comprehensive spending data for U.S. retirees is the annual Consumer Expenditure Survey (CE) conducted by the Census Bureau for the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).  As stated on their website,&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, [http://www.bls.gov/cex Consumer Expenditure Survey website].&lt;/ref&gt;

:"''The CE is important because it is the only Federal survey to provide information on the complete range of consumers' expenditures and incomes, as well as the characteristics of those consumers.  It is used by economic policymakers examining the impact of policy changes on economic groups, by businesses and academic researchers studying consumers' spending habits and trends, by other Federal agencies, and, perhaps most importantly, to regularly revise the Consumer Price Index market basket of goods and services and their relative importance''."

The BLS publishes numerous tabulated summary sheets of CE data &lt;ref&gt;The BLS Consumer Expenditure Survey data, [http://www.bls.gov/cex/tables.htm tabulated format].&lt;/ref&gt; as well as short summary articles describing the extensive database.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bls.gov/cex/csxann09.pdf Consumer Expenditures in 2009 Annual Report], U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Report 1029.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Survey methodology - CE===

The methodology for the Consumer Expenditure (CE) Survey is described in chapter 16 of the BLS Handbook of Methods.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bls.gov/opub/hom/pdf/homch16.pdf Consumer Expenditures and Income], Chapter 16 in the '''BLS Handbook of Methods'''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Briefly, the CE is a combination of data from two separate surveys having different data collection techniques and covering different samples of the U.S. population.  The ''Interview Survey'' collects data from about 7,100 ''consumer units'' (households) every quarter for 5 quarters.  This survey focuses on household spending that is either relatively large (e.g. cars, major appliances) or that occurs on a regular basis (e.g. rent, utilities).  After the 5 quarters a household is dropped and a new one added in its place.  The ''Diary Survey'' focuses on spending for small, frequently purchased items (e.g. food, personal care products).  Each year about 7,100 consumer units fill in paper questionnaires which they use to record all spending over a 2 week period.  The BLS combines data from these 2 surveys to generate the final CE tables.

===Average spending by age ranges - CE===

General data for retirement age spending can be gleaned from the CE survey Expenditure Tables which organize the data by age ranges.&lt;ref&gt;The Expenditure Table [http://www.bls.gov/cex/csxstnd.htm ''Age of reference person''] contains the data organized according to age groups. From this web page you can access Expenditure Tables back to 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;  Key information from these tables for 2007 (pre-recession) and 2009 (late-recession) is summarized in the table below.  Spending data for the "pre-retirement" age group 55-64 have been added for comparison.  Spending in the sub-categories is shown as a percentage of the total.

If conversion of the dollar amounts to those for single (consumer unit = 1.0) or married (consumer unit = 2.0) is desired, the so-called ''square root rule'' can be used.&lt;ref name="CUDiff"&gt;According to the square root rule, a family of 2 needs only 1.414 (= square root of 2) as much money as a single person to maintain the same standard of living.  To convert dollar amounts for a consumer unit of 1.6 to those for a married couple (consumer unit  = 2), multiply by 1.414 / 1.265 = 1.118.  Refer to Fisher ''et.al.'', reference [11].&lt;/ref&gt;  

Key observations on spending for the average person in these age ranges are:

* Total Spending dropped during the transition into retirement (ages 55 - 64 to ages 65 – 74), and continued dropping into ages 75 and older.
* Both income and spending dropped slightly from 2007 to 2009, possibly as a response to the economic uncertainty surrounding the housing bubble recession.
* Housing + Related is by far the highest spending category for all age groups.
* There is very little percentage change in spending for food, clothing and entertainment for all the age ranges.
* Transportation spending drops for the 75+ age range.
* Health care spending rises steadily across the age ranges, becoming almost twice as large for the 75+ age range as for the 55-64 age range.
* Spending as a percentage of the pre-retirement, pre-tax average income (corrected for consumer unit differences&lt;ref name="CUDiff"/&gt; was about 66% (ages 55-64), 62% (ages 65-74) and 50% (ages 75+).

===Influence of spending (income) level - CE===
The BLS also publishes "Cross-tabulated" tables.&lt;ref&gt;The BLS Cross-tabulated data tables are at [http://www.bls.gov/cex/csxcross.htm http://www.bls.gov/cex/csxcross.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; Using these it is possible to examine how spending patterns change according to retiree income.&lt;ref&gt;Refer to the BLS CE Survey's [http://www.bls.gov/cex/csxcross.htm Cross-tabulated tables] for "Age of reference person by income before taxes" and the "65 or older" cohort.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the CE Expenditure Tables separate retirees into two age groups (ages 65-74 and ages 75+), the cross tabulated tables lump together spending for all person 65 and over.  The following table shows the spending data from the combined 2006-2007 (pre-recession) surveys.

|}&lt;br clear="all"&gt;

Notice for the lower three household income ranges that Total Spending &lt;u&gt;''exceeds''&lt;/u&gt; pre-tax Income.  The BLS survey methodology includes as Income only taxable dollar flows (e.g. the taxable portion of Social Security benefits, pension and annuity payments, traditional IRA withdrawals, bank interest).  This indicates that people within the lower three ranges are receiving substantially tax-free Social Security benefit payments and/or are withdrawing non-taxable personal savings to meet their spending needs.

Key observations on average spending across these income ranges are:

* Food spending, expect for the very lowest income group, constitutes a relatively constant percentage of Total Spending.
* Housing + Related is by far the highest spending category for all age groups.  The lowest income group spends about 45% more on housing relative to the higher income groups (48% versus 33%).
* The absolute necessities of living (Food and Housing) consume about 64% of spending for the lowest income group, versus about 46% for the highest three income groups.  This suggests that lower income retiree spending gets squeezed by somewhat inflexible lower limits for Food and Housing.
* Clothing spending constitutes a relatively constant percentage of Total Spending.
* Higher income groups spend a considerably higher percentage on Transportation than the lower income groups.
* Healthcare spending as a percentage is slightly higher for the middle income groups.

===Overcoming difficulties in data interpretation===
There are difficulties in using age as a proxy for retirement status.  The BLS Consumer Expenditure tables contain data for both "retired" and "non-retired" individuals within each age range.  For example, Fisher ''et.al.''&lt;ref name="Fisher"&gt;J. Fisher, D. Johnson, J. Marchand, T. Smeeding and B. Torrey, [http://crr.bc.edu/working-papers/the-retirement-consumption-conundrum-evidence-from-a-consumption-survey/ The Retirement Consumption Conundrum: Evidence from a Consumption Survey], '''Economics Letters Vol.99''', Issue 3 (Jun. 2008), pp.482-485 &lt;/ref&gt; determined the percentage of persons retired within CE data and how that percentage changed with age for several cohorts of individuals.&lt;ref&gt;A '''''Cohort''''' is defined as a group of people who were born within the same limited time range and whose characteristics are studied across an extended time frame.  See the [http://www.bls.gov/bls/glossary.htm BLS Glossary of Terms]. &lt;/ref&gt;  The percentage retired for just one of these cohorts is shown in the following table:

:{|border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4"
|align = "center" |'''Age Range'''
|align = "center" |'''CE Study Year'''
|align = "center" |'''% Retired'''
|-
|align = "center"|55 - 59

|-
|align = "center"|75 - 79

|align = "center"|79.5%
|}&lt;br clear="all"&gt;

The definition of "retired" they used was rather strict: no work income for the past year and self-identified as retired.  Thus individuals even at older ages who derive some income from outside work were counted by Fisher ''et.al.'' as non-retried.  Nevertheless, the transition from non-retired to retired status between ages 60 and 75 shown in this table seems entirely reasonable.  It is probably wise to consider spending data for ages 65-74 in the previous CE tabulations to represent mostly ''but not completely'' retired individuals.

Researchers with the energy to analyze the original BLS CE database more thoroughly are able to make important refinements to their retirement spending conclusions.  For example Fisher ''et.al''. use such refined analysis techniques and determine a "real dollar" median spending drop at retirement of 2.5%, followed by about a 1% per year median spending drop over the next 15 years.&lt;ref name="Fisher"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Hatcher has reported on an analysis of the raw CE database in which retirees were separated out from non-retirees for all households over age 50.&lt;ref name="Hatcher"&gt;Charles B. Hatcher, [http://www.soa.org/library/monographs/other-monographs/2007/october/mono-2007-m-as07-2-hatcher.pdf  A Decomposition of the Various Effects of Retirement on Consumption], talk presented at the Needs and Spending in Retirement Symposium, the 2007 Society of Actuaries Meeting (Oct. 15-17, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;  He used the same rule as Fisher ''et.al''. (above) to distinguish these two groups.  Hatcher found a much stronger spending drop at retirement than Fisher ''et.al''.: retired households spend about 25% less per quarter than non-retired households in the same age range.  He also found that spending during retirement dropped slowly with age.  But in his estimation the drop in spending at retirement would have a stronger affect on a calculated retirement savings target than the drop in spending as retirement progressed.

Bernheim ''et.al''.&lt;ref name="Bernheim"&gt;Douglas Bernheim, Jonathan Skinner and Steven Weinberg, [http://www.dartmouth.edu/~jskinner/documents/SkinnerWhatAccounts.pdf What Accounts for the Variation in Retirement Wealth Among U.S. Households?], '''American Economic Review, Vol. 91''', No. 4 (2001), pp 832-857.&lt;/ref&gt; found that expenditures dropped by 14% at retirement, midway between the results reported by Hatcher and Fisher ''et.al''.  Bernheim used panel data &lt;ref name="panel"&gt;A '''Panel Study''' follows the same group of households as they age.&lt;/ref&gt; on U.S. households from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics &lt;ref name="psid"&gt;The [http://psidonline.isr.umich.edu Panel Study of Income and Dynamics] (PSID) focuses on U.S. household socioeconomics and health over lifetimes and across generations.&lt;/ref&gt; in their analysis.  Therefore their result would not be tainted by questions of retirement status.

==The Health and Retirement Study (HRS) survey==
The Health and Retirement Study (HRS) is a biennial survey of Americans over the age of 50.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hrsonline.isr.umich.edu/ Health and Retirement Study website].&lt;/ref&gt;  It is conducted by the Survey Research Center at the University of Michigan for the National Institute on Aging.  The HRS provides retirement spending data that complement those from the BLS Consumer Expenditure Surveys.  The National Institute on Aging publication '''''Growing Older in America: The Health and Retirement Study''''' contains many general observations on retirement living (through 2002) derived from the HRS surveys.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hrsonline.isr.umich.edu/index.php?p=dbook Growing Older in America: The Health and Retirement Study], The National Institute on Aging.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Survey methodology - HRS===
The methodology for the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) survey is described in a series of documents posted at the HRS website.&lt;ref&gt;The HRS website has documents describing the [http://hrsonline.isr.umich.edu/index.php?p=sdesign&amp;jumpfrom=II survey methodology].&lt;/ref&gt;  The HRS focuses only on households having persons over 50 years old.  In contrast to the CE surveys, the HRS survey interviews the ''same household units'' every other year until their death.   Every six years (every third survey) a new cohort of household units covering the ages 51-56 is added to the survey set.  This new set of household units is referred to as a ''wave''.  In 2004 more than 26,000 individuals were contacted as part of the survey.  In order to ensure that the survey results are representative for minority subgroups within the U.S. population, oversampling is employed for African Americans and Hispanics.


Similarly to the CE database, researchers interested in the spending habits of American retirees perform and publish detailed studies of the HRS database.  The Survey Research Center at the University of Michigan maintains a searchable bibliography of these studies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hrsonline.isr.umich.edu/index.php?p=biblio Searchable bibliography] of articles based on the HRS survey data.&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the more recent broad examinations of retiree spending based on the HRS database was published by B. Butrica, J. Goldwyn and R. Johnson in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara A. Butrica, Joshua H. Goldwyn and Richard W. Johnson, [http://crr.bc.edu/working-papers/understanding-expenditure-patterns-in-retirement/ Understanding Expenditure Patterns in Retirement], Center for Retirement Research at Boston College (CRR) Working Paper No. 2005-03. Jan. 2005, 41 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;  The most relevant portions of their paper are summarized here.

===Spending categories===
In order to simplify their data analysis, Butrica ''et.al''. subdivided the survey spending data into the 8 broad categories shown in the table below.  These categories are similar in many respects to the CE database categories, expect that the HRS pulls purchases of Consumer Durable Goods out of separate CE categories and groups them together.

|}&lt;br clear="all"&gt;

===Median spending by age ranges - HRS===
Using the 8 spending categories tabulated above, Butrica ''et.al'' performed a wide range of data analyses with the goal of identifying spending trends from pre-retirement through the later years of life.  As shown in the following table, the spending data for the "Median Retiree" were grouped into three age ranges and were expressed as a percentage of total spending.  The spending data were further subdivided by marital status, since this turned out to be a significant variable.

General Median Spending Observations (&lt;u&gt;married&lt;/u&gt; adults):

* The median ''per capita'' spending fell with age (in 2001 dollars): $17,409 at ages 53 - 64, $15,414 at ages 65 - 74, and finally $13,678 at ages 75+.
* The median expenditure dropped by 21% from youngest to oldest group, and by 11% from middle to oldest group.
* Per capita spending in retirement was 50% (or less) of ''pre-tax'' income before retirement.
General Median Spending Observations (&lt;u&gt;non-married&lt;/u&gt; adults):

* The median retiree ''per capita'' spending was higher than for married persons.
* In contrast to married individuals, median spending barely dropped from the ages 53 - 64 group ($17,196) to the ages 65 - 74 group ($17,083), and then was lower for the ages 75 + group ($15,390) by only about 10%.
* Per capita spending in retirement was 70% (or less) of ''pre-tax'' income before retirement.
Housing Observations:

* Spending within the Housing category represented the largest expense regardless of age or marital status.  On a per capita basis, non-married persons spent a larger percentage on Housing than did married persons.
* The spending going to mortgages declines with age, but spending for utilities and maintenance increases with age.
* Blacks and Hispanics devote a larger percentage of spending to Housing than do Whites.
* 25% of married adults ages 65 and older are homeowners with mortgages.
* Non-married individuals are nearly 3 times more likely to rent their homes in retirement.
Health Care Observations:

* Spending for Health Care increases between the youngest and oldest age groups for both married and non-married adults.  But even in later life (ages 75+), spending for Health Care still remains significantly lower than for Housing.  The popular stereotype of Health Care being the largest expense for older retirees does not appear to be correct.
* Insurance premiums are the largest spending sub-category, followed by prescription drugs, health services and medical supplies.
* Retirees who complement Medicare using non-group insurance spend more for insurance premiums and prescription drugs than do those with access to group insurance.
* For older married persons in poor health, the per capita Health Care spending is almost twice as large as for those in excellent health.  In contrast, for non-married person there is only a nominal increase.
Observations for Other Spending Categories

* Per capita Food spending for married persons is only slightly lower than for Health Care.  For non-married persons spending for Food is slightly higher than for Health Care during the earlier years of retirement.
* Spending for clothes drops off after retirement but then remains fairly stable on a percentage basis.
* Transportation and Entertainment spending are roughly equal and decline slightly through retirement for both married and non-married.
* For retired married persons, spending for Gifts and Other Consumer Durables increase in later retirement, but not for non-married persons.
A regression analysis of a subset of the HRS data for 2001, 2003 and 2005 that separated out retired from non-retired individuals was presented by Chen ''et.al''.&lt;ref&gt;Yung-Ping Chen, John C. Scott and Jie Chen, [http://www.soa.org/library/monographs/other-monographs/2007/october/mono-2007-m-as07-2-chen.pdf Retirement Spending and Changing Needs during Retirement: Summary of Regression Analysis], presented at the 2007 Society of Actuaries Annual Meeting.&lt;/ref&gt;  They confirmed that moving from the 65-69 age group to the 70+ age group led to a decline in Total Spending.  Within subcategories, the only significant increase in spending with age was for Health Care.

===Influence of spending (income) level - HRS===

The same survey data can be looked at from a different perspective by grouping them according to the absolute level of ''per capita'' spending.  The following two tables show how retiree spending changes when moving from a very low spending sub-population (5&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; – 15&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; percentile range) to a very high spending sub-population (85&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; – 95&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; percentile range).  The data for married and non-married persons are grouped into separate tables in order to highlight the differences between these groups.  Note that the Total Spending row shows 2001 dollar amounts.

Spending observations across spending (income) groups:

* For married persons the ''per capita'' Total Spending in the highest percentile range (85&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; – 95&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;) is about 6 times larger than for the lowest range (5&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; – 15&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;).  For non-married persons, the difference is 8 times.
* For both married and non-married persons the ''per capita'' spending percentage for Housing is greatest for those in the lowest spending range.
* In spite of the increasing total spending levels, the percentage spending for Health Care shows only modest changes across the spending (income) groups.  Those persons with access to more money spend larger amounts on Health Care.
* The percentage spending on Food drops significantly for the higher spending groups.  This trend is more pronounced that seen in the BLS CE data.
* Clothing is a nearly constant percentage of spending for all spending groups.
* The percentage spending on Entertainment rises across the spending groups, particularly for non-married persons.
* The percentage spending on Other Consumer Durables rises across the spending  groups, particularly for the highest two percentile ranges.

===Heterogeneity in retirement spending===

A careful reading of the literature shows there to be a tremendous amount of heterogeneity between retirees in how their spending changes at retirement and as they age.&lt;ref name="hurst"&gt;Erik Hurst, [http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/erik.hurst/research/retirement_consumption_survey_wharton.pdf Understanding Consumption in Retirement: Recent Developments], Chapt. 3 in '''Recalibrating Retirement Spending and Savings''' (eds. [[John Ameriks]] and Olivia Mitchell), Oxford University Press (2008) pp 29-45.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although it is useful to understand spending patterns for the “average retiree”, it is also important to examine the distribution of spending around the average.  In this regard the data from long term panel studies&lt;ref name="panel"/&gt; such as the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) are more useful than data from rotating panel studies such as the Consumer Expenditure Survey (CE).&lt;ref&gt;The HRS, being a long term panel study, follows the same household units from their early 50s until death.  This allows a more detailed measurement of the distribution of spending habits among retirees.  In contrast the CE survey follows the spending of a household for only 5 quarters.  Conclusions about long term changes in retiree spending based on the CE database must be derived from changes in populations averages, which is not nearly as precise.&lt;/ref&gt;

Consider for example the spending drop that often accompanies retirement.  Bernheim ''et.al''.&lt;ref name="Bernheim"/&gt; used panel data on U.S. households from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics &lt;ref name="psid"/&gt; and estimated an average spending drop of 14% at retirement.  Hurd and Rohwedder &lt;ref name="Hurd2"&gt;Michael Hurd and Susann Rohwedder, [http://www.nber.org/papers/w9586 The Retirement Consumption Puzzle: Anticipated and Actual Declines in Retirement Spending], NBER Working Paper 9586 (March 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;  analyzed this spending drop in more detail using the CAMS supplement to the HRS survey.&lt;ref&gt;'''CAMS''' is the Consumption and Activities Mail Survey, which is collected biennially in odd-numbered years as a supplement to the Health and Retirement Study (HRS).&lt;/ref&gt;  Grouping the data by quartile of household wealth, they found that the households with the lowest 25% of wealth experienced the largest average drop in spending at retirement: 22%.  At increasing wealth quartiles the spending drop became progressively less: 17%, 13% and 7%.  These estimates are very consistent with the 14% overall average drop reported by Bernheim ''et.al''., even though a different panel study database was used.  The heterogeneity about the “average” is apparent.

When the above data are examined from a different perspective, a new type of heterogeneity is discovered.  Hurd and Rohwedder &lt;ref name="Hurd2"/&gt; also analyzed their CAMS data from the perspective of amount of spending drop regardless of household wealth.  They found that only about 53% of households studied exhibited a drop in spending at retirement, another 35% reported a negligible change in spending at retirement, while 12% reported an increase in spending at retirement.  

Another factor that can impact retirement spending is whether the retirement was voluntary or involuntary.  Involuntary retirement is a more common occurrence than is often appreciated: as many as 25% &lt;ref name="hurst"/&gt; to 28% &lt;ref name="Lachance"&gt;Marie-Eve Lachance and Jason S. Seligman, [http://glennschool.osu.edu/faculty/seligman/2009%2010%20Lachance%20&amp;%20Seligman%20--%20Involuntary%20Retirement.pdf Involuntary Retirement: Prevalence, Causes and Impacts], Paper presented at the annual meeting of the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management -APPAM (2009), 47p.&lt;/ref&gt; of retirements fall into this category.  The overwhelming number of involuntary retirements can be traced back to major health difficulties or extended unemployment.&lt;ref name="Lachance"/&gt;  Involuntary retirement typically is associated with a sharp drop in spending.&lt;ref name="hurst"/&gt;  66% of involuntary retirees report being bothered somewhat or a lot by not having enough income, whereas only 21% of voluntary retirees report similar feelings.&lt;ref name="Lachance"/&gt;

==The retirement consumption puzzle==
Many economists have noted with puzzlement that individuals exhibit a significant drop in their spending upon retirement.&lt;ref&gt;James Banks, Richard Blundell and Sarah Tanner, [http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~uctp39a/Banks-Blundell-Tanner-1998.pdf Is There a Retirement-Savings Puzzle?], '''The American Economic Review, Vol. 88''', No. 4 (1998) p.769.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Michael Hurd and Susann Rohwedder, [http://www.nber.org/papers/w13929 The Retirement-Consumption Puzzle: Actual spending change in panel data], NBER Working Paper No. 13929 (April 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;  The puzzlement derives from an economist's expectation that people will plan ahead in order to smooth their spending across predictable changes in income, such as accompany retirement.

E. Hurst, in reviewing much of the research on the topic of spending changes at retirement, has proposed 5 key facts:&lt;ref name="hurst"/&gt;
* Certain types of spending actually do drop sharply as households enter into retirement.
* The spending drops are mostly limited to 2 categories: work related items and food.  Drops in work related items are not at all surprising.
* Drops in food related spending have a straightforward explanation.  Retirees spend more time in food preparation and therefore need spend less money.  The actual types and quantities of food consumed do not substantially change.
* There are strong variations in spending patterns upon retirement across the spectrum of retirees.  For example, households showing the greatest drop in spending upon retirement tend to have the smallest personal savings.  Additionally, there does appear to be a small segment of retirees (no more than 25%) that not only spend less money upon retirement, but actually consume less.  That is, they are unable to maintain their pre-retirement lifestyle even by substituting their time for money.
* Households that experience such real drops in consumption often experienced involuntary retirement.  These may be caused by either extended job layoffs or by significant health issues that preclude continued work.  This is the segment of the retiree population that exhibits the largest drop in spending upon retirement.

==Race and retirement spending==

Both the Consumer Expenditure Survey (CE) and the Health and Retirement Survey (HRS) contain information on the respondent's race.  These databases reveal that there are differences in spending between the median White, African American and Hispanic retiree.&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Bahizi, [http://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2003/06/art3full.pdf Retirement expenditures for Whites, Blacks, and persons of Hispanic origin], '''Monthly Labor Review, Vol. 126''', No. 6 (2003) pp20-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

* &lt;u&gt;Housing&lt;/u&gt;: the homeownership rates for White retirees are significantly higher than for African American or Hispanic retirees.  But for all three groups housing is by far the largest percentage spending category.
* &lt;u&gt;Food&lt;/u&gt;: Hispanics allocate the largest percentage to total food and food at home, followed by African American and White retirees.  Whites allocate a larger percentage to food away from home and on alcoholic beverages.
* &lt;u&gt;Transportation&lt;/u&gt;:  African American retirees spend about half as much on new cars and trucks as Whites or Hispanics, but spend more on used cars and trucks.  Whites spend a larger percentage share on air transportation than the other groups.
* &lt;u&gt;Health Care&lt;/u&gt;: the median Hispanic retiree spends the highest percentage share on total health care, followed by African Americans and then Whites.

'''Replacement rates''' are a simple way to estimate your spending needs in retirement. The gross (pre-tax) income you will need in retirement is calculated as:

:'''Gross Income''' (retired) '''=''' '''Gross Income''' (pre-retirement) '''&amp;times; Replacement Rate''' 

As with any simplified method, its predicted retirement income might or might not be correct for you. This depends on how closely your individual situation matches the assumptions in the equation above.

The GSU/Aon RETIRE Project Report is the primary source of replacement rates for U.S. retirees. Aon Consulting publishes a summary and extension of this report in their ''Replacement Ratio Study&amp;trade;''. They calculated these replacement rates assuming that retirees want to maintain their pre-retirement lifestyle in retirement. They make some adjustments for expected spending changes spending (for example, work related expenses will disappear). These replacement rates depend on pre-retirement income and marital status. This article includes the main replacement rate tables from the latest Aon Consulting ''Replacement Ratio Study&amp;trade;''.

Both the RETIRE and the Aon Consulting reports are very explicit in pointing out that their replacement ratios are valid for the "average" retiree. ''They recommend that you adjust for your own specific circumstances.''

You can find many popular articles that recommend replacement rates of 0.75 to 0.85 for retirement planning. Typically the author simply states that these are commonly accepted estimates, but they rarely supply references to show how they got these numbers. The GSU/Aon replacement rates are based on the Bureau of Labor Statistics' [[Surveys of retirement spending#U.S. Consumer Expenditure Survey (CE) | Consumer Expenditure Survey]] database, derived transparently.

The GSU/Aon replacement rates ignore whether there is enough income to maintain that level of spending throughout retirement. By contrast, many articles look at what levels of spending retirees can sustain across their retirement lifespan. These &lt;u&gt;also&lt;/u&gt; use the term "replacement rate". Except in limited circumstances, these two definitions of ''replacement rates'' are ''not'' interchangeable. To help avoid confusion, think of them as ''desired replacement rates'' (GSU/Aon RETIRE) and ''achievable replacement rates'' (other than GSU/Aon RETIRE).

==The replacement rate concept==
''Replacement Rates'' (also referred to as ''Wage Replacement Ratios''&lt;ref group="note"&gt;See: Michael Dalton, ''Retirement Planning and Employee Benefits'', 4th ed., (ME Publishers, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; or simply as ''Replacement Ratios'') give you a simplified method to estimate your spending needs in retirement. The gross (pre-tax) income you will need in retirement is calculated as:

:'''Gross Income''' (retired)  '''=''' '''Gross Income''' (pre-retirement) '''&amp;times; Replacement Rate''' 

By rearranging this equation, the replacement rate is the ratio of (gross income received in retirement) divided by (a pre-retirement gross income):
 
:'''Replacement Rate  '''=''' Gross Income''' (retired) '''/ Gross Income''' (pre-retirement)

Working with a ratio lets you easily see if you will be spending more or less in retirement than when you are working. Spending more in retirement has a ratio greater than one; spending less in retirement has a ratio less than one. It is expressed either as a decimal or as a percentage formats; for example, "0.70" or "70%".

Pre-retirement gross income is often your income just before retirement. This might be for the year immediately before retirement, or for an average of a limited number of years before to retirement. But there is no reason why you could not calculate a replacement rate using a gross income received many years before retirement. For example, the economics-inspired [[Models of spending as retirement progresses#Life Cycle models | Life Cycle]] approach often averages pre-retirement income over an entire working lifetime.&lt;ref name="scholz"&gt;{{cite web| author1=John Scholz| author2=Ananth Seshadri| url=http://www.mrrc.isr.umich.edu/publications/papers/pdf/wp214.pdf| title=What Replacement Rates Should Households Use?| publisher=Univ. of Michigan Retirement research Center Working paper| date=2009| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091211093354/http://www.mrrc.isr.umich.edu/publications/papers/pdf/wp214.pdf| archive-date=December 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Replacement rate definitions===
Retirement planning literature uses two definitions of replacement rates: 
#''Desired'' retirement income
#''Achievable'' retirement income
To prevent confusion, this article will use ''desired replacement rate'' and ''achievable replacement rate'' respectively.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The terms ''desired'' and ''achievable'' are original to this article. They are here to highlight differences between the replacement rate definitions you can find in retirement planning literature.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Desired replacement rates====
You can use replacement rates based on a ''desired'' retirement income to develop retirement plans that ''target a specified lifestyle''. Most often, the specified lifestyle is the one you had just before retirement. In this case, the replacement rate maintains an unchanged standard of living upon retirement. However, a retirement plan (and associated replacement rates) could also target an enhanced or a simplified retirement lifestyle. Replacement rates must account for tax (that is, depend on tax rates), because you fund retirement with after-tax money.&lt;ref name="aon"&gt;{{cite web| publisher=Aon Consulting| url=https://www.aon.com/about-aon/intellectual-capital/attachments/human-capital-consulting/RRStudy070308.pdf| title=2008 Replacement Ratio Study: A Measurement Tool for Retirement Planning| accessdate=September 1, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To be clear, there is no upfront consideration to whether or not you can sustain this desired lifestyle (that is, desired retirement income) across your anticipated retirement lifespan. Trying to live at your desired income level could deplete your personal savings prematurely! Regardless, ''desired'' replacement rates are used to determine a savings and/or investing approach which eventually reaches your target retirement lifestyle.

====Achievable replacement rates====
Replacement rates based on an ''achievable'' retirement income focus on pre-tax income sources actually available you.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;See the definition of [http://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/replacement-rate.asp Replacement Rate], from Investopedia.&lt;/ref&gt; You find ''achievable'' replacement rates most commonly in studies of ''Retirement Preparedness'', where the goal is to better understand a retiree's ability to generate post-retirement income.
 
Some studies focus on a single source of retirement income, for example, only Social Security, or only pension income. When these studies give replacement rates, they consider only that source of income, relative to pre-retirement gross income. To give a realistic example, one study showed that Social Security benefits started at age 62 (in 2003) would have replaced 0.31 (31%) of the average recipient’s pre-retirement income.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;See Table A-2 in Benjamin Bridges and Sharmila Choudhury, [http://www.socialsecurity.gov/policy/docs/workingpapers/wp109.html Social Security as a Retirement Resource for Near-Retirees, by Race and Ethnicity, Nativity, Benefit Type, and Disability Status], ORES Working paper No. 109 (Oct. 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;
 
You can also add together several (or even all) sources of retirement income before calculating the corresponding achievable replacement rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Patricia Martin| url=https://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/ssb/v65n1/v65n1p17.pdf| title=Comparing Replacement Rates Under Private and Federal Retirement Systems| publisher=Social Security Bulletin, Vol. 65| date=2004| accessdate=September 1, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="munnell"&gt;{{cite web| author1=Alicia Munnell| author2= Mauricio Soto| url=https://ssrn.com/abstract=1150172| title=What Replacement rates do Households Actually Experience in Retirement?| publisher=Center for Retirement Research at Boston College Working Paper 2005-10| date=2005| accessdate=September 1, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, you can calculate a total replacement rate from the sum of annuitized personal savings, Social Security benefits and pension benefits.&lt;ref name="dalirazar"&gt;{{cite web| author1=Nasrin Dalirazar| author2=Marina Vornovytskyy| author3=David Hedengren| url=http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/wealth/Final%20Draft_Paper_Revised4_5_2011.pdf| title=Can Americans Afford to Retire?| publisher=US Census Bureau| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120503220357/http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/wealth/Final%20Draft_Paper_Revised4_5_2011.pdf| archive-date=May 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Paper presented at the Fall 2010 Annual Association for the Public Statistics Division, Labor Force Statistics Branch conference. Table 1 in this paper gives replacement rates for single individuals based on anticipated future financial resources.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;&gt;Scholz and Seshadri give an annuity formula for converting a lump sum portfolio into a stream of annual income payments.&lt;/ref&gt; Replacement rates using the same pre-retirement income in the denominator are additive: that is, the total replacement rate is the sum of the replacement rates from individual income streams.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The only restriction is that the same pre-retirement gross income is used in the denominator to calculate all the replacement rates. In this case, the additive property of replacement rates follows directly from the rule for adding numerators when fractions have the same denominator.&lt;/ref&gt;

When economists and social scientists study retirement preparedness, they want to estimate the total achievable replacement rate covering all sources of retirement income. Depending on assumptions, these achievable replacement rates can vary greatly. In a white paper, Blanchett reported that assumptions can cause replacement rates to vary widely, between 30% and 148%!&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=David Blanchett| url=https://www.davidmblanchett.com/Inaccurate%20Precision%2006.15.12%20FINAL.pdf| title=Inaccurate Precision: The Danger of Replacement Rate Calculations| date=June 15, 2012| publisher=Ibbotson Associates White Paper}}{{dead link}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
An economics-inspired [[Models of spending as retirement progresses#Life Cycle models | Life Cycle]] approach derives a special type of achievable replacement rate.&lt;ref name="scholz"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kotlikoff"&gt;{{cite web| author=Laurence Kotlikoff| url=http://spwfe.fpanet.org:10005/public/Unclassified%20Records/FPA%20Journal%20March%202008%20-%20Economics'%20Approach%20to%20Financial%20Planning.pdf| title=Economics’ Approach to Financial Planning| publisher=Journal of Financial Planning| date=2008}}{{dead link}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of this approach is to smooth consumption &lt;u&gt;both&lt;/u&gt; before and after retirement. It must therefore generate a &lt;u&gt;lifetime&lt;/u&gt; spending and saving plan. Specialized software usually does the calculations to create this lifetime plan.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The commercial software [https://esplanner.com/ ESPlanner] uses the Life Cycle approach to determine a spending and saving plan that covers both pre- and post-retirement.&lt;/ref&gt; The ratio of the resulting smoothed spending rate to some measure of pre-retirement income (for example, the average income across the entire working lifetime) gives the Life Cycle replacement rate.&lt;ref name="scholz"/&gt; A Life Cycle replacement rate example is shown [[:#Life Cycle replacement rates | below]].

===Relationship between desired and achievable replacement rates===
[[Image:Replacement_Rate_01.png|thumb|Figure 1. Replacement rate vs. savings]]
Figure 1 shows the relationship between desired and achievable replacement rates. (Note: ''RR'' is used as an abbreviation for ''replacement rate'' on the vertical axis.)

In an article that deals with ''achievable'' replacement rates, Dalirazar and others show in their Table 1 that these rates increase as the percentage of pre-retirement income saved increases.&lt;ref name="dalirazar"/&gt; This relationship makes perfect sense: the more you save before retirement, the higher the income you can maintain after retirement. The dashed line in Figure 1 shows this.

But for ''desired'' replacement rates, the relationship to savings is just the opposite. In Aon Consulting's ''Replacement Ratio Study'', Appendix I, the equation for replacement rate will force these rates to ''drop'' as savings increase.&lt;ref name="aon"/&gt; The desired replacement rate calculation starts with the gross income immediately before retirement. Taxes and savings are then subtracted to arrive at the pre-retirement spending. The more that is saved, the less that will be left for spending. Aon then assumes that the same spending will be maintained in retirement (that is, the desired spending in retirement is the same as before retirement). As pre-retirement savings increase, the post-retirement spending is forced to drop. This causes the calculated replacement rate to drop as savings increase. The solid line in Figure 1 shows this relationship.

As the savings percentage just before retirement is increases, the achievable RR curve rises and the desired RR curve drops. Eventually they intersect, as shown in Figure 1.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;If the desired RR curve starts out below the achievable RR curve at zero savings, the curves will clearly never intersect. This infrequent situation indicates that a persons existing annuitized savings, plus Social Security and pension benefits, are more than enough to maintain their pre-retirement lifestyle. They do not need to save any extra. In fact, they will receive excessive income in retirement. One potential response to this situation would be to borrow funds before retirement (that is, generate negative savings), planning to repay them after retirement with the excess income. This extends the desired and achievable RR curves along the negative Savings axis until they intersect.&lt;/ref&gt; ''At this savings percentage the retiree will be able to achieve their desired retirement lifestyle most of the time''. However, beware of being too confident in these results, because the achievable replacement rate depends on market returns.

===Replacement rate properties===
'''Additive'''. A total replacement rate can be split into its individual components (mathematically, it is "additive"). This is useful. It lets you combine both types of replacement rates in a single retirement plan. For example, suppose that you want a lifestyle corresponding to an 80% replacement rate. Further, suppose that your Social Security will only supply a 40% replacement rate. In this case, your personal savings must be able to safely supply the remaining 40% replacement rate (80% total – 40% Social Security = 40% from savings).

'''Inflation'''. You expect retirement spending to increase over time because of inflation. Therefore the "nominal" replacement rate (nominal retirement income divided by pre-retirement income) would also increase over time. But almost all approaches to retirement planning separate out inflation effects, so that the replacement rates being considered reflect only the relationship between ''real'' spending amounts.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;In economics ''real'' refers to the purchasing power net of any price changes over time. For more, see [[wikipedia:Real versus nominal value (economics)|Real versus nominal value (economics)]], from Wikipedia.&lt;/ref&gt; When retirement spending categories have strongly different inflation rates, it may be useful to separate out their ''real'' replacement rate components. For example, Steinberg and Lucas propose separating out medical spending from other spending in retirement.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;See: Allen Steinberg and Lori Lucas, "Shifting Responsibility: The Future of Retirement Adequacy in America," ''Benefits Quarterly, Vol. 20'', No. 4 (2004) pp.15-26.&lt;/ref&gt; This give two replacement rates: a non-medical rate and a medical rate. This would let you apply different inflation rates to each spending component individually.

'''Taxes'''. Federal and state income taxes have a major impact on desired replacement rates. Changes in the tax code will lead to changes in the size of replacement rates, as well as how these rates vary as a function of gross income level.&lt;ref name="palmer"&gt;{{cite web| author=Bruce A. Palmer| url=http://rmictr.gsu.edu/Papers/RR08-1.pdf| title=2008 GSU / Aon RETIRE Project Report| publisher=Center for Risk Management and Insurance Research (Georgia State Univ.)| date=2008| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140123135351/http://rmictr.gsu.edu/Papers/RR08-1.pdf| archive-date=January 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; When taxes in retirement increase (for example, on Social Security or pension benefits), the gross income needed to meet desired retirement spending also increases. This directly increases the corresponding desired replacement rates. Higher income households tend to be affected more by this, because low income households typically owe little to no income taxes in retirement. Changes in state income taxes on retirement income are also a factor.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;For example, in 2012 Michigan dramatically increased taxes on pension benefits for retirees born after 1945.&lt;/ref&gt;

Achievable replacement rates are unaffected by future changes in taxes on retirement income. This is because these replacement rates do not depend on an implicit tax calculation. In general, this is the accepted approach. However, according to Scholz and Seshadri, changes in average effective tax rates &lt;u&gt;do&lt;/u&gt; affect the ''Life Cycle'' replacement rate model.&lt;ref name="scholz"/&gt;

'''Income vs. Spending'''. Replacement rates connect most closely to ''pre-tax'' retirement ''income'' rather than ''after-tax'' retirement ''spending''. But you can derived absolute spending amounts from them. In fact, the more rigorous approaches to calculating replacement rates estimate absolute spending amounts as an intermediate step.&lt;ref name="aon"/&gt; Later sections of this article discuss approaches to calculating spending amounts from replacement rates.

==Qualitative influences on desired replacement rates==
It is quite common to find articles the recommend replacement rates less than 1.0 (100%). Factors making a lower retirement income (replacement ratio less than 100%) feasible include:&lt;ref name="munnell"/&gt;&lt;ref group="note" name="tacchino"&gt;For details, see: Kenn B. Tacchino, ''Determining the Amount a Client Needs for Retirement'', Chapter 5 in ''Financial Decisions for Retirement'', (The American College Press, 2005), pp5.1-5.55.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Reduction in payroll taxes. Without earned income, most retirees will no longer be paying a 6.2% OASDI or a 1.45% Medicare payroll tax on their salary.
* Similarly to the disability component of OASDI, private disability insurance is no longer needed.
* Similarly to the Social Security component of OASDI, the retiree is no longer saving for retirement. The part of pre-retirement salary that went into savings is no longer needed.
* Increased federal Standard Deduction.
* Partial [[Taxation of Social Security benefits | taxation of Social Security benefits]]. Depending on their modified adjusted gross income, Social Security recipients might not owe any taxes on these benefits. At most, they will be taxed on 85% of these benefits.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;See: [[Taxation of Social Security benefits]].&lt;/ref&gt;
* State income taxes may be lower, because many retirees move after retirement, and many states fully exclude Social Security income from taxes. Other states have partial tax exemptions for pension and IRA income.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Kiplinger offers [https://www.kiplinger.com/retirement/602202/taxes-in-retirement-how-all-50-states-tax-retirees state by state summaries] of retiree income tax rates.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The retiree may move, probably to a lower cost-of-living state, and this would decrease their expenses.
* Potential for higher medical deductibles. With lower taxable incomes, more of the medical expenses of older retirees will potentially exceed the 7.5% limit for itemizing.
* Mortgage payments may stop. Many retirees pay off their mortgage at about the time of retirement, so they need less income.
* Work-related expenses stop. What had previously been spent on commuting to work, special clothing and meal purchases is no longer required or is needed at a much lower amount.
* Senior Citizen Discounts. Some purchases may cost 5-15% less due to special discount programs available to older people.
* No dependent children. Many families are no longer spending for the education or living expenses of their children by the time they retire.

Not all retirement planners agree that a retiree's replacement rate will be less than 1.0 (100%).&lt;ref group="note" name="tacchino" /&gt; There are situations in which a rate of more than 100% might be appropriate. Factors making a higher retirement income (replacement rate more than 100%) necessary include:
* Medical expenses. Medical expenses increase steadily with age for almost all retirees. Those retiring before becoming Medicare eligible may see a substantial increase in medical insurance premiums until age 65.
* Travel, vacation and lifestyle changes. Soon after retirement many people increase their spending on special travel and extended vacations that were not feasible while they were still working.
* Dependents. In some cases retirees may support adult children having physical or mental disabilities. In other cases the retiree's elderly parents may require partial or complete support, sometimes for expensive long-term health care.
* Additional services. As retirees age they may need to hire people to help with chores that they can no longer accomplish independently. Such chores include yard upkeep, snow removal, minor house maintenance, and housekeeping. Sometimes a retiree's physical impairments may prevent them from driving themselves, requiring them to hire others to do so.

Thinking over the reasons cited for replacement rate reductions as well as increases, it is clear that the range of different retiree lifestyle and circumstances can easily lead to wide differences in the appropriate replacement rate. '''One retirement replacement rate does not fit everybody.'''

==GSU/Aon RETIRE project==
Aon Consulting teamed up with the Georgia State University's Center for Risk Management and Insurance Research to support the RETIRE Project. RETIRE is an acronym for '''Ret'''iree '''I'''ncome '''Re'''placement. Georgia State University publishes the results as the GSU/Aon RETIRE Project Report.&lt;ref name="palmer"/&gt; Aon Consulting publishes its summary and extension of the findings as the ''Replacement Ratio Study&amp;trade;''.&lt;ref name="aon"/&gt; The studies released in 2008 are the seventh update in the series. The primary question targeted by this study series is, ''"How much income will I need at retirement to maintain my standard of living?"'' The replacement ratios in this study assume no changes in lifestyle upon retirement. '''They are desired income replacement rates'''.

===Methodology===
The 2008 study derived its replacement ratios primarily from the Bureau of Labor Statistics' ''[[Surveys of retirement spending#U.S. Consumer Expenditure Survey (CE) | Consumer Expenditure Survey]]'' for 2003, 2004 and 2005.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;See: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, [http://www.bls/gov/cex Consumer Expenditure Survey]{{dead link}} website.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt; [[Surveys of retirement spending]] provides more information about the BLS Consumer Expenditure Survey, its methodology and typical recent data for retiree spending needs.&lt;/ref&gt; The replacement rates were calculated based on data for 12,823 "working" households and 6,498 "retired" households.

The baseline calculation is for a married couple with one wage earner who retires at age 65 (that is, when Medicare eligibility begins). Their non-working spouse is age 62. The calculation starts with an average, pre-retirement gross (pre-tax) income. From this income it subtracts average taxes and retirement savings. This gives the average pre-retirement spending. It then converts this into after-retirement spending by either adding or subtracting retirement-related average changes in spending. Finally, it estimates post-retirement taxes and adds them to the average spending to arrive at an average post-retirement income. The final replacement ratio is the post-retirement income divided by the pre-retirement income. Appendix II and III of the study show these calculations in detail.&lt;ref name="aon"/&gt;

===GSU/Aon replacement ratios===
The baseline replacement ratios for pre-retirement incomes ranging from $20,000 to $250,000 are shown in the "Total Ratio" column of the following table. The table also shows the average Social Security benefit for each family, expressed as a percentage of pre-retirement income. The middle column, "From Private and Employer Sources", is the difference between the other two column entries (that is, it is derived, not directly calculated).

Significant points:
* Total replacement rates are highest for the low income households, drop to a minimum for families with pre-retirement incomes of $70,000 to $80,000, and then rise again for extremely high income households.
* Social Security benefits supply a much higher portion of the retirement income stream for lower income households than for higher income households.
* Conversely, higher income families aiming to maintain their pre-retirement lifestyle in retirement will need to supply a correspondingly higher percentage of their income via pensions or private savings withdrawals.
* In general, high-income individuals can maintain their pre-retirement lifestyle only by having &lt;u&gt;substantial&lt;/u&gt; personal savings. Income from Social Security and employer pensions will typically not be nearly enough to maintain their lifestyle.

Besides the baseline scenario, the Aon study also calculates replacement ratios for other household types. The four types of households it considers are:
* Baseline - a married couple with one wage earner who retires at age 65. Their non-working spouse is age 62.
* Single person age 65
* Married couple with one wage earner who retires at age 65. Their non-working spouse is also age 65.
* Married couple ages 65 and 62. Both earn wages.

The following table shows the replacement ratios for all four scenarios.

Significant points:
* The replacement rates for singles show less variation across income levels than for any of the married scenarios.
* The replacement rates show minimal variations between the 3 married scenarios. Below the $60,000 pre-retirement income level there are &lt;u&gt;''no''&lt;/u&gt; differences. This is supposedly because such retirees do not pay significant income taxes.

===Adjustments to replacement ratios===
The RETIRE and Aon Consulting reports are very careful to point out that their replacement ratios (shown in the tables above) are valid for the "average" retiree. They recommend that you adjustment for your own circumstances. Adjustments include:
* Individual differences in savings rates. The calculation approach used in the GSU/Aon RETIRE study assumes an "average" savings rate in the years just before retirement. If a you or your family save &lt;u&gt;''more''&lt;/u&gt; than average, you can maintain your preferred lifestyle by spending &lt;u&gt;''less''&lt;/u&gt; than average. The replacement ratio should therefore be ''lowered'' to adjust for their higher saving rate. Conversely, if you or your family save less than average, you would need to adjust the replacement rate upward.
* Differences in types of savings. Withdrawals from tax-deferred retirement savings accounts (for example, traditional IRA or 401(k) accounts) are taxed, leading to a larger desired replacement rate. But withdrawals from Roth IRAs or brokerage (taxable) savings do not increase taxable income and therefore lead to a lower replacement rate.
* Changes in big-ticket spending items. Effective replacement ratios can be reduced for people who retire immediately after paying off their mortgage or immediately after finishing payments for a child's college expenses. Once again, their pre-retirement spending lifestyle was at a lower than average level.
* Specifics of retiree medical coverage. The Aon study's baseline calculation assumes that medical expenses increase by somewhere between $1,000 to $1,500 upon retirement. But in some cases medical expenses might increase by a significantly larger amount. For example, retirement before Medicare eligibility will lead to much larger increases in medical insurance premiums. A similar effect can arise when people who had employer-subsidized medical insurance while working lose that support after retirement.

Medical expense changes at retirement can have a particularly strong effect on the replacement ratio. The Aon study illustrates this by recalculating these ratios under three different medical expense scenarios:
* '''Best Case''': essentially no change in medical expenses upon retirement.
* '''Baseline Case''': medical expenses are assumed to increase by about $1,000 to $1,500 annually, depending on income.
* '''Worst Case''': medical expenses are assumed to increase by $400 per month upon retirement. This $400 represents the approximate monthly costs of Medicare part B and D premiums, plus a premium for supplemental ("Medigap") coverage.

As this table shows, the total replacement ratio for lower income level families can be substantially shifted by their actual retirement medical expenses.

If your individual spending situation is different from the averages used in the Aon study, you could calculate ''personalized'' (individually adjusted) replacement ratios from scratch. The calculation would follow the procedure explained in the appendices of the Aon Consulting report. This calculation is essentially the same as used in the Current Spending approach to estimating a simple retirement budget; see [[Budget models of retirement spending]].

===Replacement rate changes with aging===
Although often ignored, there are reasons to expect replacement rates to drop modestly over the course of retirement. Various [[surveys of retirement spending]] have shown that real spending in retirement typically drops steadily until at least the late 70s. For example Fisher and others analyzed the BLS [[Surveys of retirement spending#U.S. Consumer Expenditure Survey (CE) | Consumer Expenditure]] data and determined a "real dollar" median spending drop at retirement of 2.5%, followed by about a 1% per year median spending drop over the next 15 years.&lt;ref name="fisher"&gt;{{cite web| author1=J. Fisher| author2=D. Johnson| author3=J. Marchand| author4=T. Smeeding| author5=B. Torrey| url=http://crr.bc.edu/images/stories/Working_Papers/WP_2005-14.pdf| title=The Retirement Consumption Conundrum: Evidence from a Consumption Survey| publisher=Center for Retirement Research at Boston College Working Paper WP 2005-14| date=2005}}{{dead link}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a spending drop would also cause replacement rates to decrease over time. At even older ages spending and associated replacement rates might continue dropping if the retiree has adequate Medigap and long-term care insurance.&lt;ref group="note" name="tacchino" /&gt; But without adequate medical insurance, end-of-life medical costs can jump significantly, increasing the corresponding replacement rates.

Tacchino has proposed two methods to factor in spending and replacement rate reductions with aging.&lt;ref group="note" name="tacchino" "/&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;See: Kenn B. Tacchino and Cynthia Saltzman, "Do accumulation models overstate what’s needed to retire?", Journal of Financial Planning, Vol. 12 (Feb. 1999), pp 62-74.&lt;/ref&gt; If it is necessary to use one replacement rate for the entire retirement time period,&lt;ref group="note"&gt;This might be the case when using retirement software that only allows a single replacement rate to be entered.&lt;/ref&gt; a weighted-average of the various replacement rates might suffice.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Tacchino has published a table of so-called "Blended Replacement Rates" that allow you to skip this calculation; see K. Tacchino and C. Saltzman, ''Do accumulation models overstate what's needed to retire?'', ''Journal of Financial Planning, Vol. 12'' (Feb. 1999), pp 62-74. There is a copy [http://www.pitecreative.com/staging/latesavers/partone.html here]{{dead link}}. But beware; this table assumes a much higher rate of real spending decline with aging than seems consistent with the [[Surveys of retirement spending]].&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative approach would be to use one replacement rate before age 75 and a second, lower rate afterwards.

==Life Cycle replacement rates==
The RETIRE and Aon Consulting studies showed how desired replacement rates can change depending on gross income, marital status and medical spending assumptions. This section looks briefly at the dependency on measurement time period.

The GSU/Aon RETIRE study calculated desired replacement rates assuming an equivalent consumption lifestyle &lt;u&gt;immediately&lt;/u&gt; before and after retirement. If the time period of equivalent consumption is broadened, the replacement rates should change. This would be especially true if households tended to spend proportionally more on themselves just before retirement when compared to both early in life and after retirement. If this time period of equivalent consumption is expanded to cover the &lt;u&gt;entire&lt;/u&gt; working and retirement lifespan, then the calculation should become effectively identical to that used by the [[Models of spending as retirement progresses#Life Cycle models | Life Cycle]] approach.&lt;ref name="kotlikoff"/&gt;

From this perspective, replacement rates calculated using the Life Cycle approach are one extreme in a continuum of possible desired replacement rates. The GSU/Aon replacement rates are the other extreme. It is useful to compare a set of Life Cycle replacement rates to those published by Aon Consulting. The comparison uses Life Cycle replacement rates published by Scholz and Seshadri.&lt;ref name="scholz"/&gt; These are shown in Table 4 below.

{| class="wikitable"

|}

The first column in Table 4 categorizes households into income deciles: higher deciles represent higher gross incomes. Scholz and Seshadri chose to use two different pre-retirement gross incomes for the replacement rate calculations. The "Lifetime Income" column uses the ''real'' household income averaged over the entire working lifetime as the measure of pre-retirement gross income. The "Top 5 Earning Years" column uses the ''real'' household income averaged over the ninth through the fifth years before retirement (i.e. the years during which household income is usually maximized). Replacement rates calculated using the "Top 5 Earning Years" income are smaller, since for all income deciles except the lowest this is a larger average income.

Scholz and Seshadri did not give dollar amounts for each of their decile ranges in Table 4. But they did supply dollar amounts for the median (50%) incomes: about $35,000 for the Lifetime Income, and about $38,000 for the "Top 5 Years" income, both in 2004 dollars. From Table 1 above, the GSU/Aon median replacement rate for a $40,000 income is 0.85. This is substantially larger than either 50% decile Life Cycle replacement rate estimated from Table 4 (0.63 and 0.55). It is evident that the GSU/Aon replacement rates are systematically higher than the Life Cycle rates. As expected then, replacement rates also change depending on the time period covering the lifestyle equivalency.

On the whole, the GSU/Aon replacement rates are systematically higher than the Life Cycle rates. This suggests that a typical retiree tends to have a higher consumption lifestyle around the time period of retirement compared to earlier or later in life. After all, if they tended towards a steady consumption across their entire life, their replacement rates would be lower and closer to the Life Cycle approach values. This conclusion is consistent with the observation that ''real'' spending for the typical retiree drops steadily as they age.&lt;ref name="fisher"/&gt; Looked at another way, this indicates that, on average, people tend to spend proportionally more on themselves during their maximum earning years just before retirement. For Life Cycle planning, this tendency is less than optimum.&lt;ref name="kotlikoff"/&gt; People would be happier if they smoothed their consumption over their entire lifespan.

Kotlikoff has pointed out several weaknesses in the GSU/Aon RETIRE study replacement rates when compared to the [[Models of spending as retirement progresses#Life Cycle models | Life Cycle]] approach:&lt;ref name="kotlikoff"/&gt;
*Replacement rates assume that a household's spending after retirement will remain the same as before retirement. In particular this ignores a number of new spending needs that can arise in retirement.
*Replacement rates assume that a household's demographic composition will remain constant throughout retirement. This is inconsistent with the reduction in household unit size during aging that is shown in the [[Surveys of retirement spending#U.S. Consumer Expenditure Survey (CE) | Consumer Expenditure Survey]] data.
*Replacement rates assume that in general a household's retirement saving pattern is consistent with consumption smoothing at the time of retirement. There is no reason to believe that this is true.

==Calculating after-tax income from replacement rates==
It is important to estimate your after-tax income in retirement, which is the money you have available to spend. This is your gross retirement income after subtracting federal and state taxes. The following two equations, when combined, show the connection between after-tax income and replacement rates.

:'''Gross Income''' (retired)  '''=''' '''Gross Income''' (pre-retirement) '''&amp;times; Replacement Rate'''
:'''After-tax Income''' (retired)  '''=''' '''Gross Income''' (retired) '''&amp;minus; Federal taxes &amp;minus; State taxes'''

The first equation shows how the gross income in retirement is estimated by means of a replacement rate and a pre-retirement gross income. The second equation shows that the after-tax income, money available to spend in retirement, is related to the gross income in retirement by subtracting taxes.
 
To estimate your federal and state taxes, you will need to identify all your combined sources of income. You need this because different sources of income often are taxed at different rates. Typical sources of retiree income include [[Taxation of Social Security benefits | Social Security]], [[Defined Benefit Pension Plan | pensions ]], interest, [[Dividend | dividends]], capital gains, withdrawals from tax-advantaged savings (for example, [[401(k)]], [[:403(b) | 403(b)]], and [[:Traditional IRA | traditional IRAs]]), and withdrawals of tax-free savings ([[:Roth IRA]]s, principal in bank or brokerage accounts, and so on).

The easiest way to calculate your federal and state taxes is using commercial software. The drawback is that this software uses current tax rates. What if you anticipate future tax rate increases and want to include this in your projected retirement spending?

In this case you will need to either use software or a tax spreadsheet that allows you to change the tax rate assumptions, or do the tax calculation by hand.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;There is a second order correction to the calculation of retirement spending that you might need if you anticipate large future tax rate increases. This is because the GSU/Aon replacement rates are themselves functions of the tax rates. Suppose you use a replacement rate based on today’s tax structure to calculate your gross income in retirement. Working backwards to calculate the final spending in retirement with a different tax rates may introduce errors.&lt;/ref&gt;

This article is the entry point for the '''Retirement spending''' topic. It provides a high level summary of the information contained in the associated articles.

===Overview===
Many studies on retirement spending start with an assumed total savings at retirement and then estimate the spending that might be allowable each year afterwards. These studies are often especially concerned with estimating the maximum spending that will not lead to premature depletion of personal savings, known as the [[Safe Withdrawal Rates |safe withdrawal rate]]. These models treat the ''Total Savings at Retirement'' as the key independent variable. The spending for each year in retirement is adjusted so that the savings last as long as planned.

'''This article series takes the opposite approach'''. They treat ''Retirement Spending'' as the key independent variable. You first develop an estimate of your ''desired'' spending in retirement. Next the planning process incorporates assumptions about your longevity, inflation, and investment returns. Finally, it gives an estimate for the total savings at retirement necessary to maintain this desired retirement spending.

===Retirement spending===
In some cases, you might need to explore the types and amounts of spending that you might expect in retirement. The following articles are good starting points for further reading:

Article: ''[[Inflation and retirement spending]]
:An in-depth review of how price inflation is incorporated into retirement planning.

Article: ''[[Surveys of retirement spending]]''
:Discusses the recent results from the two main spending surveys conducted within the U.S.: The Bureau of Labor Statistics' ''Consumer Expenditure Survey'' and the ''Health and Retirement Study''. Includes tables with examples of retirement spending of average households across a range of income and marital status.

Article: ''[[Medical spending in retirement]]''
:Describes the impact medical spending could have on your retirement and how to incorporate it into your retirement planning.

Article: ''[[Retirement risk]]'' 
:Reviews the types of financial and health risks that might unexpectedly deplete your savings in retirement. Presents ways of incorporating these risks as optional spending in a retirement plan.

===Models===

'''''Budget'' (or ''expense'') ''models'' of retirement spending''' come in a variety of forms. Their common factor is that they estimate total retirement spending by working with estimates of spending in numerous, smaller budget categories. This general approach offers a lot of flexibility for modeling retirement spending patterns, but it has at a price. Specifically, it takes longer to assemble spending estimates for each budget category.

You usually start the budget modeling process by developing a single estimate of your total spending at the start of retirement. There are two typical approaches, which this article refers to as a ''Current Spending'' approach and a ''Bottom-up'' approach.

The Current Spending approach starts with your total (current) spending just before retirement. You then examine each spending category to see what adjustments, either up or down, you anticipate immediately after retirement. You then use these spending changes to arrive at a total spending just after retirement.

The Bottom-up approach develops a spending estimate for each expense category “from scratch”. Usually you would use a detailed budget worksheet to help ensure that you do not overlook any category of retirement spending. You then total these category estimates to give you the total spending estimate. This approach is more time consuming than the Current Spending approach, but can to produce a better estimate. The Bottom-up approach also gives you a better starting point for projecting how your budget might change as retirement progresses.

A ''Dual Budget'' model is a direct extension of the Bottom-up model, and incorporates &lt;u&gt;two&lt;/u&gt; total spending estimates. The first or ''Essential'' budget represents the lowest level of retirement spending that you can accept. The second or ''Preferred'' budget represents a higher level of retirement spending that you want to achieve. The difference between these two budgets is ''Discretionary'' spending. Your spending in any year is assumed to fall within the range bounded by these two budgets.

You can model changes in ''real'' (uninflated) spending as retirement progresses using budgets. Two popular approaches are ''Step Change'' budgets and ''Flexible Spending'' budgets.

The ''Step Change'' approach considers retirement as divisible into stages (or phases) within which real spending does not change. It often uses three stages to cover a retiree’s lifespan. At the boundary between each stage there is a discontinuous change in real spending, the ''step change''. Usually only the total spending is modeled as changing in moving between stages. But some models apply independent step changes to each of a limited number of spending categories.

A ''Flexible Spending'' budget represents the ultimate in budget modeling complexity. You can think of it as as a Step Change budget model in which each stage could last for as little as one year. In addition, it uses a very large number of spending categories, each of which can have its own series of independently-timed step changes. This type of budget model is very good at accurately describing spending patterns that are unique to a particular retiree. Retirement calculators based on this approach can be quite complex, and it may take you significant time to learn to use such a calculator.

==Introduction==
This article focuses on the ''budget'' (or ''expense'') ''model'' approach for estimating retirement spending.

The most common type of budget model uses a ''single budget'' to describe all retirement expenses. However, you can use the same approach to create retirement spending models that use more than just one budget. This flexibility is valuable because [[Surveys of retirement spending]] consistently show considerable diversity of retirees' spending patterns.

For people who have not used a written budget to track their spending, getting started can seem daunting. But by thoughtfully breaking a '''Retirement Spending Plan''' into smaller spending units, you can get a better grasp on how to proceed.

Figure 1 shows a generalized approach to categorizing the expenses you are likely to encounter in retirement. Medical expenses (shown to the left) are separate from non-medical expenses because the former have a significantly higher expected inflation rate. Over the last 20 years (1992-2011) medical expenses have been increasing at roughly 6.1% annually,&lt;ref group="note"&gt;This annualized average medical cost inflation was calculated from the [http://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/NationalHealthExpendData/Downloads/tables.pdf National Health Expenditure Data Set, CY 1960-2011],{{dead link}} Table 21, published by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services. It is an average of the All Benefit data for Medicare and for Private Health Insurance.&lt;/ref&gt; while general living expenses (as measured by the CPI-U inflation index) have only increased by about 2.5% annually.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;This annualized average CPI-U was calculated from data in the Bureau of Labor Statistics All Urban Consumers Price Index [ftp://ftp.bls.gov/pub/special.requests/cpi/cpiai.txt CPI-U History Table, 1913 to Present]{{dead link}}&lt;/ref&gt; When you are budgeting for medical and non-medical expenses over a 20 to 30 year retirement, you cannot ignore this difference in price inflation.

Figure 1 separates retirement expenses vertically into two categories: ''Ongoing'' and ''Limited Duration''. Ongoing expenses in retirement are those that you can reasonably expect to persist throughout your entire retirement. Some might occur every year, such as medical insurance premiums or housing expenses. Others might occur periodically, such as new appliances or cars, but you can conceptually budget for them using an annual, pro-rated spending. In contrast, the Limited Duration retirement expenses are ones you anticipate will occur only over a limited time frame. Medical examples would be end-of-life hospitalization or long term care expenses. Non-medical examples would be home mortgage payments which might not be complete before you start retirement.

Starting with these higher level budget segments, you can make further spending subdivisions. The goal is to create a sufficient number of distinct budget categories so that you can easily track and model your retirement spending. Many people find it useful to start with pre-made budget worksheets. Using worksheets is an important part of developing any budget model: they help you to consider all potential expenses.

For reference, Table 1 shows a simplified set of budget categories. This table is a slightly modified version of the Health and Retirement Study category table in the [[Surveys of retirement spending]] wiki article.

===Inflation===
Your retirement spending budget will typically increase each year because of price inflation. These price increases can be very irregular and in some years quite large.&lt;ref&gt;Wikipedia file: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:US_Historical_Inflation.svg US Historical Inflation.svg]&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, inflation is considered the retiree’s worst enemy.&lt;ref&gt;John Howe, [http://ezinearticles.com/?Inflation---A-Retirees-Worst-Enemy&amp;id=1306235 Inflation – A Retiree’s Worst Enemy]{{dead link}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scott Pearson, [http://www.stardem.com/news/article_1d660d64-af58-5ba3-b28a-83bbe226760e.html Inflation: The greatest enemy of your retirement plan]{{dead link}} (Sept. 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of retirement planning approaches treat inflation as an independent, adjustable variable. In doing so, they separate ''nominal'' retirement spending for any year into two components: ''real'' cost referenced to a base year, and an inflation adjustment.&lt;ref&gt;[[wikipedia:Real versus nominal value (economics)|]], Wikipedia, retrieved September 15, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; This article follows the same approach. Unless stated otherwise, the budgeting models discussed in this article deal with real expenses, not adjusted for inflation. Inflation adjustments are covered in [[Inflation and retirement spending]].

===Income taxes===
Many of the budget models here do not consider taxes on income (earned or unearned) as an independent budget item, but rather an outcome of the total spending for other budget categories. However, like property taxes for homeowners, some income taxes merit separate budget items. An example of this is income tax for a Roth IRA conversion. 

Any complete estimate of retirement spending must eventually include all tax payments.

==Single budget models==
Single budget models help someone approaching retirement to develop one estimate of their anticipated spending early in retirement, often targeting spending for the very first year of retirement.&lt;ref name="tacchino"&gt;B. Tacchino, "Determining the Amount a Client Needs for Retirement," Chapter 5 in '''Financial Decisions for Retirement''', (The American College Press, 2005), pp5.1-5.55.&lt;/ref&gt; These budget estimates supply a starting point for extrapolating how spending changes as the retiree ages. In the very simplest case, extrapolation might ignore real spending changes during retirement: the initial, real spending budget is assumed to be the same across the entire retirement. But often the initial spending budget is assumed to exhibit real spending changes as retirement progresses.

In practice you would typically develop the budgets using current costs (that is, ''in this year’s dollars''). This makes it simpler to come up with a realistic spending estimate for the various budget items. The real budget costs at retirement are assumed equal to the current cost estimates. If you need to model spending in nominal (inflated) dollars at retirement, you apply an inflation adjustment.

There are two main approaches to building a single budget model; the ''Current spending'' approach and the ''Bottom-up'' approach. 

===Current spending approach===
This is the simpler of the two approaches. You start with your current annual spending and make adjustments for expenses that decrease or increase at retirement.&lt;ref name="anspach"&gt;Dana Anspach, [http://moneyover55.about.com/od/preretirementplanning/a/estimate_expenses_in_retirement.htm Estimate How Much You Will Spend Each Year in Retirement], About.com, Money Over 55.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="metlife"&gt;[http://www.metlife.com/assets/ib/retirement/strategy/retirement-expense-worksheet.pdf MetLife Retirement Income Worksheet]{{dead link}} (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; The following step-by-step sequence describes how to implement this approach.

'''Step 1''': Determine your latest, annual pre-retirement spending 
*Start with your latest, full year total income.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;This is not your Adjusted Gross Income (AGI), but the Total Income on IRS form 1040. This total is located just before the “above the line” deductions are taken into account.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Subtract payroll taxes (OASDI, Medicare) and income taxes (federal, state and local)
*Subtract savings: IRA contributions, self-employed plan contributions, bank and brokerage account additions.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Ignore pre-tax contributions to 401(k), 403(b) and similar savings plans. Such pre-tax contributions are withheld before your employer reports your taxable income.&lt;/ref&gt;
'''Step 2''': Subtract expenses that will be lower at retirement. Examples include, but are not limited to:
*Work-related expenses (clothing, transportation, meals away from home)
*Spending on your children (living and educational costs)
*Home mortgage payments
*Medical costs, if Medicare and Medigap cost less than your current insurance.
'''Step 3''': Add expenses that will increase at retirement. Examples include, but are not limited to:
*Vacation travel
*Dining out and entertainment
*Medical costs, especially if they were formerly employer-subsidized
'''Step 4''': The result is your simple budget total spending.

There is a close relationship between this approach and a personalized (individually adjusted) replacement rate. The GSU/Aon RETIRE Project to derive post-retirement spending from a pre-retirement gross income.&lt;ref name="aon"&gt; [http://rmictr.gsu.edu/Papers/RR08-1.pdf 2008 GSU/Aon RETIRE Project Report]&lt;/ref&gt; uses this same four step calculation.

The Current Spending budget approach stops with the retirement spending. The RETIRE project goes on to calculate replacement rates by dividing the retirement spending by a pre-retirement gross income. See [[Replacement rate models of retirement spending]] for more information on replacement rates and the GSU/Aon RETIRE Project.

*Quicker and simpler compared to other budgeting approaches.
*Can give a very reasonable result if your current lifestyle and expenses are close to those you anticipate having early in retirement.
|
*Unless well thought out, the expense adjustments in Steps 2 and 3 may be unrealistic.
*May underestimate the average contribution of big, infrequent expenses (for example, automobiles or major appliance) if too few of these occurred in the year whose spending is being analyzed.&lt;ref name="anspach"/&gt;
*This budget may not provide a good starting point for incorporating real spending changes over time.
|}

===Bottom-up approach===
In this approach you develop a personalized spending budget "from scratch" by estimating your retirement spending for every conceivable budget category.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Updegrave, "Create a Retirement Plan That Works for ''You''", chapter 5 in '''We’re Not in Kansas Anymore: Strategies for Retiring Rich in a Totally Changed World''' (Crown Business Publishers, 2004) 304pp.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="carlson"&gt;Robert C. Carlson, "How Much Will You Need", Chapter 3 in '''The New Rules of Retirement: Strategies for a Secure Future''', (John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 2004) 288 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; Use a highly detailed budget worksheet to guide you through the process. (The budget categories in Table 1 above are &lt;u&gt;not&lt;/u&gt; detailed enough.) Make spending estimates using current costs (that is, ''in this year’s dollars''). When you have entered spending estimates for all categories, total them up. This becomes your estimate of real budgeted spending at retirement.

The Bottom-up approach gives you the best spending estimate when you use a comprehensive budget worksheet as a guide. Table 2 contains examples of such budget worksheets.

|}

==Dual budget models==
A ''Dual Budget'' model is a direct extension of the Bottom-up budget model. Instead of estimating a single spending budget at the beginning of retirement, you develop &lt;u&gt;two&lt;/u&gt; budgets.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Merriman, '''Live it Up Without Outliving Your Money''', revised and updated edition (John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 2008), 206pp.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ellen Hoffman, [http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/mar2005/nf20050311_5138_db026.htm Time to Abandon the 70% Solution],{{dead link}} '''Business Week''', March 11, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="modly"&gt;Helen Modly, [http://advisor.morningstar.com/articles/fcarticle.asp?docId=4178 Helping Clients to Accurately Estimate Retirement Expenses],{{dead link}} Morningstar Advisor (Aug. 31, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; The first budget, variously called a ''Minimal'' / ''Basic living'' / ''Essential'' budget, represents the lowest level of real retirement spending that you can accept. The second budget, variously called a ''Desired'' or ''Preferred'' budget, represents the higher level of real retirement spending that you want. The difference between these two budgets is your ''Discretionary'' spending. Your spending in any year is assumed to fall within the range bounded by these two budgets.

===Retiree spending behaviors===
It is simplistic to imagine that retirees would maintain a fixed real spending each year. Rather, they would be expected to cut back on their spending during times when they do not feel as financially secure.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin J. Lansing, [http://www.frbsf.org/publications/economics/letter/2011/el2011-21.html Gauging the Impact of the Great Recession], Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco FRBSF Economic Letter, July 11, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; For retirees having savings invested in stocks or stock mutual funds, stock bear markets would be such a time of reduced spending. This is a natural response to declines in personal net worth caused by declining equity values. But the Dual budget model sets a &lt;u&gt;lower&lt;/u&gt; limit on this reduced spending: ''the essential budget spending level''. Conversely, when a retiree feels financially secure (for example, during a stock bull market), they would once again increase their real spending.&lt;ref&gt;Lonnie K Stevans, [http://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1007&amp;context=lonniekstevans&amp;sei-redir=1#search=%22spending%20changes%20stock%20market%22 Aggregate consumption spending, the stock market and asymmetric error correction],{{dead link}} '''Quantitative Finance, Vol. 4''' (2004) pp 191-198.&lt;/ref&gt; The Dual budget model sets an &lt;u&gt;upper&lt;/u&gt; limit on this increased spending: ''the desired budget spending level''.

Working with an essential budget is a smart approach to retirement planning. After all, if you cannot safely maintain your essential spending level, then you should delay retirement and build more financial resources. On the other hand, it is also possible to say that retirees will adjust their spending to whatever income is available, regardless of how low that might be. In some cases this does happen,&lt;ref group="note"&gt; For a particularly eye-opening example of how low retiree income might drop, read about the retirement experiences of Paul Nelson in the article [http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/08_50/b4112046151127.htm Unretired: Retirees are Back, Looking for Work],{{dead link}} '''Business Week''', Dec. 15, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; but it can be an extremely painful experience for the retiree.

===Practical implementation===
The easiest way to estimate the Dual budgets is to use a worksheet designed for this purpose. Each budget category on the worksheet accepts two entries: an ''essential'' spending amount and a ''discretionary'' spending amount.&lt;ref name="metlife"/&gt;&lt;ref name="modly"/&gt; The sum of both gives your desired or preferred budget amount. The process of filling in cost estimates for each category is identical to that already described for the Bottom-up budgeting approach. The Excel [http://www.best-retirement-calculators.com/Retirement-Living-Expenses-Calculator.htm Retirement Living Expenses]{{dead link}} spreadsheet supports dual budgets.

===Relationship with withdrawal methods===
When you use dual budget spending models for retirement planning, you should combine them with [[Withdrawal methods]] that allow your real spending to vary. A simple example of such a withdrawal method is ''Constant Percentage''. Under this method a retiree is never allowed to withdraw more than a pre-determined percentage (often 4.5% to 6.0%) of their previous year-end total savings. As total savings rise and fall in response to stock market cycles, nominal withdrawals will likewise rise and fall. The maximum withdrawal percentage is chosen to fulfill the [[Safe Withdrawal Rates]] restriction that savings will not be depleted, even if a long period of poor investment returns occurs. The dual budget model then supplies an ''additional restriction'': the allowable spending set by the withdrawal rule will also not drop below the essential budget level. The retirement planning calculation combines all these restrictions to give a personal savings target at retirement.

Besides the Constant Percentage method, there are many other [[Withdrawal methods]] that allow real spending to vary. An extensive summary of these methods is given on the [http://web.archive.org/web/20100628050004/http://www.bobsfinancialwebsite.com/VariableWithdrawals.html Variable Withdrawals in Retirement] archived page from the old '''Bob’s Financial Website'''. Of these additional methods, the ''Floor and Ceiling'' withdrawal methods&lt;ref&gt;William Bengen, [http://www.bobsfinancialwebsite.com/pdfs/Conserving_Client_Portfolios_During_Retirement_Part_IV.pdf Conserving Client Portfolios During Retirement, Part IV],{{dead link}} '''Journal of Financial Planning''', (May 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Colleen Jaconetti and Francis Kinniry Jr., [http://www.vanguard.com/pdf/icrmda.pdf A more dynamic approach to spending for investors in retirement]{{dead link}} Vanguard Research (Nov. 2010) 9pp.&lt;/ref&gt; have the closest relationship to the dual budget spending model.

===Pyramid budgets===
Some retirement planners have suggested extending the Dual budget concept to incorporate even more levels of spending. As part of their '''Modern Retirement Theory'''&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; approach to retirement planning, Jason Branning and Ray Grubbs proposed goal-segmenting retirement assets to cover four categories.&lt;ref&gt;Jason K. Branning and M. Ray Grubbs, ''Modern Retirement Theory: Reaching Client Goals in Every Market'', Journal of Financial Planning supplement on '''[https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3419038 Retirement Distribution Planning]''' (Dec. 2009), pp 14-17.&lt;/ref&gt; Starting from the pyramid base, these categories are:
*''Base Fund'' – for essential retirement living expenses. 
*''Contingency Fund'' – for hedging against significant, unpredictable events.
*''Discretionary Fund'' – for spending above the essential levels.
*''Legacy Fund'' – for inheritance and charitable purposes.

Mitch Anthony in his book ''The New Retirementality''&lt;ref&gt;Mitch Anthony, '''The New Retirementality''', 3rd Edition (John Wiley and Sons, Inc., 2008) 281 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; proposed using a five level spending pyramid. Starting from the pyramid base, these levels are:
*''Survival Money'' – to pay for the basic necessities of living. 
*''Safety Money'' – to pay for guarding against potential retirement risks.
*''Freedom Money'' – to pay for activities and trips that bring enjoyment.
*''Gift Money'' – to give to people and causes we cherish.
*''Dream Money'' – to enable fulfillment of your deep desires.

Each spending level covers an increasingly discretionary need. His book contains a series of worksheets for estimating spending at each pyramid level.

==Time-varying budget models==
The previous budget models have focused on spending at one point in time, particularly at the time of retirement. But the budget model approach can be expanded to describe changes in real spending as the retiree ages. Often such ''time-varying'' budget models focus only on real changes in ''total'' spending. However, time-varying budget models can also be designed to accommodate independent changes in real spending for numerous expense categories.

Two popular approaches are referred to in this article as ''Step Change'' budgets and ''Flexible Spending'' budgets. For a more detailed discussion of ways to model spending from retirement until death, see: [[Models of spending as retirement progresses]].

===Step change budgets===
This modeling approach typically uses three to four separate budgets to approximate changes in real spending as the retiree ages. Some retirement planners recommend each budget last a specified number of years or to a specified age.&lt;ref name="stein"&gt;Michael Stein, '''The Prosperous Retirement: Guide to the New Reality''', (Emstco, LLC, 1998), 312 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="basu"&gt;Somnath Basu, [http://retireeincome.com/resources/files/Age_Banding.pdf Age Banding: A Model for Planning Retirement Needs],{{dead link}} '''Financial Counseling and Planning, Vol. 16''', No. 1 (2005) pp29-36.&lt;/ref&gt; Others recommend flexibility in how long each budget stage lasts.&lt;ref name="cowell"&gt;M. Cowell, R. Helman, A. Rappaport, S. Siegel and J. Turner, [http://www.soa.org/files/pdf/research-2007-findings-phases.pdf The Phases of Retirement and Planning for the Unexpected],{{dead link}} '''Society of Actuaries 2007 Risks and Process of Retirement Survey Report''' (Aug. 2008), 26pp.&lt;/ref&gt; Changes in real spending are discontinuous when switching from one budget to the next, hence the ''step change'' designation for such models. As a specific example, consider the following proposal by Robert Carlson:&lt;ref name="carlson1"&gt;Robert Carlson, [http://www.retirementwatch.com/CashSample4.cfm How to Vary Spending During Retirement], at Bob Carlson’s Retirement Watch.&lt;/ref&gt;

*Stage 1 budget: First few years of retirement. Higher spending than in pre-retirement as the retiree pursues leisure time dreams while still having relative youth and good health.
*Stage 2 budget. Until about age 75. Spending settles back down to a lower, stable value.
*Stage 3 budget. After age 75. Spending shifts down again. Cites the BLS Consumer Expenditure data to suggest a 25% drop in real spending relative to early retirement.
*Stage 4 budget. End of life. Medical / long-term care expenses might drive up spending unless insurance is available to cover these costs.

Although others besides Carlson have suggested a Stage 1 budget with higher real spending,&lt;ref name="stein"/&gt; it is clear from [[Surveys of retirement spending]] that, ''on average'', real spending drops slightly at retirement and continues to drop steadily as retirees age into their late 70s.&lt;ref&gt;J. Fisher, D. Johnson, J. Marchand, T. Smeeding and B. Torrey, [http://crr.bc.edu/images/stories/Working_Papers/WP_2005-14.pdf The Retirement Consumption Conundrum: Evidence from a Consumption Survey],{{dead link}} Center for Retirement Research at Boston College Working Paper WP 2005-14, (Dec. 2005), 30 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; Still others have pointed out that a substantial percentage of retirees (up to 25%) leave work involuntarily and experience a real spending drop at retirement that corresponds to shifting immediately to a Stage 3 budget.&lt;ref name="cowell"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Erik Hurst, [http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/erik.hurst/research/retirement_consumption_survey_wharton.pdf Understanding Consumption in Retirement: Recent Developments],{{dead link}} Chapt. 3 in '''Recalibrating Retirement Spending and Savings''' (eds. [[John Ameriks]] and Olivia Mitchell), Oxford University Press (2008) pp 29-45.&lt;/ref&gt; '''The clear message here is that retiree spending patterns show a great deal of diversity'''. Any budget model (or retirement calculator) that assumes stepwise changes in real retiree spending must be able to accommodate such individual differences. Otherwise it will be applicable to only a limited subset of the retiree population.

'''Other Variations'''. If you wish to implement a Step Change budget model, you might find some variations on this approach to be intriguing. For example S. Basu has published a variation called ''Age Banding''.&lt;ref name="basu"/&gt; There is nothing particularly unusual about his use of three budget stages with rather fixed age ranges (66-75, 76-85 and 86-95). But he brings an added degree of realism into the model by incorporating a ''separate'' budget for each of 4 broad expense categories: taxes, basic living, healthcare and leisure.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Most budget models do not consider taxes to be an independent budget item. Rather, they calculate taxes based on the income required to cover spending in the remaining categories.&lt;/ref&gt; At each of the age band boundaries the model allows a step change in real spending, either upwards, downwards or no change. For example, basic living expenses could be given step ''drops'' at each age band boundary, but healthcare given step ''increases'' at each age band boundary. Further, his model allows for a different inflation rate to be applied to each spending category within each age band.
 
Conceptually there is no reason why the Dual budget and the Step Change budget models could not be merged. In such a composite budget model there would be an Essential and a Preferred spending level within each of the three (or more) step change budgets.

*Step Change budgets provide a more realistic treatment of spending changes during retirement than just assuming a constant real spending.
|
*There is no capability to have category spending change other than at the pre-selected stage boundaries. Stated differently, real spending must always be constant within any budget stage.
|}

===Flexible spending budgets===
The most general budget models for retirement spending allow complete decoupling of spending patterns for a wide range of living expense categories. Consider the following situations where such budgeting flexibility would prove useful:

*An early retiree plans to purchase expensive, personal medical insurance until they become eligible for a less expensive Medicare and Medigap combination at age 65.
*A retiree wants to explore how possibly needing to pay for their mother’s long-term medical care in seven years might affect how long her own savings would last.
*A near-retiree with mortgage payments lasting another thirteen years wants to incorporate this into their proposed retirement spending plan.

What all of these situations have in common is a significant expense which starts or stops at some arbitrary time during retirement. A ''Flexible Spending'' model can incorporate such category-specific, step changes in real spending. At the same time other spending categories, for example basic living expenses, could be modeled as exhibiting fairly smooth, real changes.

This type of budget model can be viewed as a logical extension of the ''Age Banding'' budget model previously discussed. Instead of three spending categories (plus taxes), a Flexible Spending model allows for a very large number of categories. Instead of fixed-length age bands for each category, the spending can start and stop at arbitrarily selected ages. Looked at from a different perspective, age bands have been effectively reduced to one year lengths.

Flexible Spending budget models are more often used within commercial retirement calculators.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Commercial retirement planning calculators with a Flexible Spending budget capability include [http://www.jlplanner.com J&amp;L Financial Planner Professional Version],{{dead link}} [http://www.myfinancialfreedomplan.com/796/retirement-planning-software/ VeriPlan Retirement Planning Software],{{dead link}} and [http://www.moneytree.com/Products/TOTALPlanningSystem/tabid/77/Default.aspx Money Tree TOTAL Planning Suite].{{dead link}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such calculators tend to be used by professional financial planners. But there are a few publicly available, free calculators that incorporate this modeling approach.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Retirement planning calculators with a ''Flexible Spending'' budget capability that you can access for free on the Internet include the [http://www.flexibleretirementplanner.com/ Flexible Retirement Planner] and the [http://personal.fidelity.com/planning/retirement/income_planner.shtml.cvsr Fidelity Retirement Income Planner] (Fidelity account login required).&lt;/ref&gt;

*Provide a personalized and very realistic treatment of spending changes during retirement.

*Gathering the data to input into this budget model is very time consuming.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' groups retirement calculators by the type(s) of retirement spending models they use. For a detailed discussion about the various types of retirement spending models, refer to the articles in the [[Retirement spending]] wiki series.

==Introduction==

There are &lt;u&gt;many&lt;/u&gt; other criteria besides spending that can categorize retirement calculators. Examples include: tax calculation method, asset classes included as investments, Social Security claiming guidance, types of tax-advantaged savings plans, and types of annuities. These tables use only spending model categories, but this does not imply that spending models are any more important than the others.

One of the most important characteristics of a retirement calculator is the method it uses to simulate potential future investment returns. Because this is important, each table has a column listing the method(s) a calculator uses. 

===Abbreviations used in the calculator tables===
These abbreviations keep the tables compact

&lt;u&gt;Runtime Environment Abbreviations&lt;/u&gt;. These indicate how to run a calculator.
*Web = Runs only through a web browser
*Win = Runs only under MS Windows
*Xcel = MS Excel spreadsheet

&lt;u&gt;Calculator Type Abbreviations&lt;/u&gt;. These categorize the calculator's approach to estimating future growth in retirement savings.
*Det = Deterministic. The calculator uses fixed, user-selected future stock and bond returns.
*HRet = Historical Returns. The calculator uses historical stock and bond returns as a guide.
*HStr = Historical stress test. The calculator uses historical U.S. stock and bond returns (and sometimes the corresponding inflation) starting from one or more specific years in the past to ''Stress Test'' the retirement plan for worst case scenarios.
*MC = Monte Carlo. The calculator uses a Monte Carlo model of stock and bond investment returns as a guide.

&lt;u&gt;Initial Retirement Spending Abbreviations&lt;/u&gt;. These are the types of spending models that can describe retiree spending at the start of retirement.
*RepR = [[Introduction to retirement spending models#Replacement rate models | Replacement Rate]]
*STot = [[Introduction to retirement spending models#Single budget models |Single Budget]], total spending only
*SWks = [[Introduction to retirement spending models#Single budget models |Single Budget]], worksheet included
*DTot = [[Introduction to retirement spending models#Dual budget models |Dual Budget]], total spending only
*DWks = [[Introduction to retirement spending models#Dual budget models |Dual Budget]], worksheet included.
*N/A = Calculator does not let the user independently set spending in retirement.

&lt;u&gt;Spending Model as Retirement Progresses&lt;/u&gt;. These are the different methods used for modeling spending.
*[[Introduction to retirement spending models#Constant (real) spending models|Constant-Real]] - starts at an amount that is adjusted for yearly inflation.
*[[Introduction to retirement spending models#Stages of retirement models | Retirement Stages]] - two or more different constant or real spending levels.
*[[Introduction to retirement spending models#Investment returns dependent models|Returns Dependent]] - spending adjusted depending upon earnings returns.
*[[Introduction to retirement spending models#Flexible spending models |Flexible Spending]] - two or more spending categories.
*[[Introduction to retirement spending models#Life Cycle models|Life Cycle]] - spending varies according to stages of life.

==Free retirement calculators==
Free online retirement calculators are widely available. As shown in the table below, most of these calculators include only a Constant Real spending model as retirement progresses. For the average retiree this type of spending model offers a less realistic description of spending patterns than the other model types (see discussion in [[Models of spending as retirement progresses#Constant (real) spending models | Constant (real) Spending Models]]).

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' examines five models of retiree spending patterns from retirement until death. These models extend the [[Introduction to retirement spending models#Initial spending models | Initial Spending]] estimates developed for the beginning of retirement so that they describe spending until death.

The Constant (Real) Spending model assumes that the real spending at the start of retirement continues unchanged until death. Although this approach is widely used, it does not correspond to a typical retiree's spending pattern. It usually (but not always) leads to an overestimate of the savings needed at retirement.

The Stages of Retirement model breaks up retirement into three or four age ranges, each of which has a different real spending pattern. Spending within each range can either be constant or varying. This model does a much better job of representing retirees' the diverse spending patterns.

Investment Returns Dependent models let retirement spending vary based on how total savings or investment returns change over time. These models are best combined with [[Budget models of retirement spending#Dual budget models | Dual Budget]] models of initial retirement spending. These models mimic retirees' tendency to vary their spending based on their net worth.

Flexible Spending models let you incorporate many individual spending categories into the total spending plan. Each spending category can have its own start and stop age, as well as spending amount. This model is excellent at representing large step changes in spending during retirement. Many retirement calculators will combine elements of this model with others already described. This combination is a very flexible framework for accurately modeling a diverse range of retiree spending patterns.

Life Cycle models calculate how a household should smooth their discretionary spending over their entire lifetime, not just in retirement. They give a detailed spending and savings plan to follow in  pre-retirement years. Doing this will gives an optimized, real spending lifestyle for years both before and after retirement.

Retirement calculators offer all of these model types. For specific examples, see [[Retirement calculators and spending]].

==Introduction==
This article is an in-depth expansion of the section [[Introduction to retirement spending models#Spending as retirement progresses | Spending as Retirement Progresses]] from the introductory article on retirement spending models. Please also see that article for background information concerning approaches used to model [[Introduction to retirement spending models#Initial retirement spending | Initial Retirement spending]]. These initial spending models supply the starting point for extrapolating spending across retirement.

As in other modeling articles of this series, this article treats retirement spending as the key ''independent'' variable in the retirement planning process. You first develop an estimate of your ''desired'' spending in retirement. From there, the planning process makes assumptions about you longevity, inflation and investment returns, and then estimates you future savings needed to maintain that retirement spending.

This article considers only the ''real'' component of retirement spending.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;In economics ''real'' refers to the purchasing power net of any price changes over time. Refer to [[wikipedia:Real versus nominal value (economics)|Real versus nominal value (economics)], from Wikipedial&lt;/ref&gt; [[Inflation and retirement spending]] covers how inflation adjustments are incorporated into the retirement planning process.

===Retirement calculator models===
There is a strong connection between retirement spending models and retirement planning calculators. Most software used for retirement planning, whether explicitly or implicitly, assumes some model of retirement spending. Its options reflect the choice of spending model. Unfortunately, some retirement calculators have many strengths but are needlessly weak in how they incorporate retirement expenses.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;See: John Turner and Hazel Witte, [http://www.soa.org/files/pdf/research-pen-retire-planning-soft.pdf Retirement Planning Software and Post-Retirement Risks],{{dead link}} The Society of Actuaries (2009), 118pp. Exhaustively examines retirement software strengths and weaknesses, including weaknesses in the area of expenses.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Retirement calculators and spending]] contains an extensive list of calculators which have been categorized in terms of the retirement spending model(s) they use. The tables in that article particularly highlight models of spending as retirement progresses. See that article for real-world examples of the spending models discussed here.

===Retiree spending: key observations===
[[Surveys of retirement spending]] reviewed and summarized data on retiree spending patterns collected by two ongoing, national U.S. surveys: the Bureau of Labor Statistics' ''Consumer Expenditure Survey'', and the ''Health and Retirement Study''. These surveys, as well as from the practical experiences reported by professional financial planners, show certain key facts:
*The ''average retiree'' exhibits a slight drop in real spending at retirement, followed by a steady decline in real spending as they age into their late 70s.&lt;ref name="fisher"&gt;{{cite web| author1=J.

They exhibit a sharp drop in real spending at retirement.&lt;ref name="hurst"/&gt; If involuntary retirement was health related, these retirees may subsequently exhibit a medical expense induced, real ''increase'' in total spending near their death.
*A smaller percentage of retirees (roughly 12%&lt;ref group="note" name="Hurd2"&gt;See: Michael Hurd and Susann Rohwedder, ''The Retirement Consumption Puzzle: Anticipated and Actual Declines in Retirement Spending'', NBER Working Paper 9586 (March 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;) exhibit an increase in real spending at retirement.&lt;ref group="note" name="stein"&gt;See: Michael Stein, ''The Prosperous Retirement: Guide to the New Reality'', (Emstco, LLC, 1998), 312 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="carlson1"&gt;{{cite web| author=Robert Carlson| url=https://www.retirementwatch.com/how-to-vary-spending-during-retirement| title=How to Vary Spending During Retirement| publisher=Bob Carlson’s Retirement Watch| date=October 17, 2017| accessdate=August 29, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is often driven by a jump in travel or other leisure activities. After a certain time period these special activities end, and real spending drops to a lower level, often closer to that of "average retirees."

How well each spending model can represent these key retiree spending patterns is an important topic.

==Constant (real) spending models==
This is the simplest of all approaches used to model spending as retirement progresses. It assumes that your real spending at the time of retirement will continue unchanged until death. It does not ignore inflation, but as explained in the Introduction, treats it as a separate, adjustable variable in the retirement planning process. In terms of spending, this model states that spending for any year in retirement equals spending in the first year multiplied by an inflation adjustment.

The constant spending model is most often combined with a [[Introduction to retirement spending models#Replacement rate models| Replacement Rate ]] or [[Introduction to retirement spending models#Single budget models| Single Budget]] model of initial retirement spending. A [[Introduction to retirement spending models#Duel budget model| Dual Budget]] model of initial spending tends to be combined with a model that allows real spending to vary between the ''essential'' and ''preferred'' budgets as retirement progresses.

===Comparison with retiree spending===
Constant real spending models do not reflect the reality that the average retiree’s spending steadily drops during retirement. Many retirement planners have pointed this out as a major shortcoming.&lt;ref group="note" name="tacchSaltz" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bernicke"&gt;{{cite web| author=Ty Bernicke| url=http://www.bobsfinancialwebsite.com/pdfs/Reality_Retirement_Planning.pdf| title=Reality Retirement Planning: A New Paradigm for an Old Science| publisher=Journal of Financial Planning| date=2005| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100509041235/http://www.bobsfinancialwebsite.com:80/pdfs/Reality_Retirement_Planning.pdf| archive-date=May 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also point out that these models &lt;u&gt;overestimate&lt;/u&gt; the total savings needed at retirement.

A constant real spending model could be appropriate in if your retirement is involuntary and your financial resources are limited. This situation would force you to immediately drop down to an ''essentials only'' spending budget. If you were living at your minimum acceptable level, you would expect your nominal spending to grow at around the rate of inflation (constant real spending) as you are forced to pay ever increasing market prices for essential goods.

However, this would also motivate you to substitute, when possible, less expensive items for your essential budget spending needs. This ''[http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/substitution-effect.asp Substitution Effect]'' causes spending to somewhat lag behind constant real spending.

===Relationship to withdrawal studies===
Some of the earliest research on [[Safe Withdrawal Rates]] used constant real withdrawals in their calculations.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Examples are The "Trinity Study" (Philip L. Cooley, Carl M. Hubbard and Daniel T. Walz, "Retirement Savings: Choosing a Withdrawal Rate That Is Sustainable", ''AAII Journal, Vol. 20'', Feb. 1998), and early research by William Bengen (William P. Bengen, "Determining Withdrawal Rates Using Historical Data", ''Journal of Financial Planning'', Jan. 1994, pp14-24.)&lt;/ref&gt; Constant real withdrawals is a close proxy for constant real spending that avoid complication from taxes. The constant withdrawals constraint let the researchers focus on their main issue of interest: how ''Sequence of Returns Risk''&lt;ref group="note"&gt;For a discussion about the origin and important of ''Sequence of Returns Risk'', see [https://web.archive.org/web/20110204183624/http://www.learningpartner.ca/News/Articles/RetirementRisks/SequenceofReturnsRisk/tabid/83/Default.aspx Understanding Sequence of Returns Risk], Learningpartner.ca, (archived).&lt;/ref&gt; impacts retiree savings survival. But because so much subsequent research uses this constant withdrawals constraint, some have mistakenly concluded that this is a realistic approximation to how retirees withdraw and spend money. As noted, the average retiree steadily reduces real spending as they age.

===Use in retirement calculators===
Free online retirement calculators most commonly use a Constant spending model. This is especially true for calculators that are deterministic, less so for those that use Monte Carlo or Historical Returns approaches.

Some free online retirement calculators let you to choose models other than constant real spending. But these will often include a constant spending model, for comparison with simpler calculators.

Retirement calculators that you pay for are much less likely to rely solely on a constant spending model. But they often include this model for comparison.

Although [[#Life Cycle models | Life Cycle]] spending models sometimes produce a constant real spending in retirement, they do this from an entirely different ''Economics Perspective''.&lt;ref name="kotlikoff"&gt;{{cite web| author=Laurence Kotlikoff| url=https://people.bu.edu/kotlikof/New%20Kotlikoff%20Web%20Page/Economics%20Approach%20to%20Fin%20Planning,%20JFP11-08-07%20posted%20Jan%203,%202008.pdf| title=Economics’ Approach to Financial Planning| publisher=Journal of Financial Planning| date=2008| accessdate=September 1, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; For more, see [[#Life Cycle models | Life Cycle models]] below.

==Stages of retirement models==

Not all retirees pass through Carlson's Stage 1 of &lt;u&gt;increased&lt;/u&gt; real spending early in retirement. The average retiree does not, but some retirees do. Typically retirees pass though Stages 2, 3 and 4. (These are the only stages considered in most 3 Stage models.) Some retirees in very poor health might have increased real spending in Stage 4, but this depends on whether their insurance is able to cover the associated higher medical costs.

Many authors besides Carlson have chosen age 75 as one of their stage boundaries.&lt;ref group="note" name="stein"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bernicke"/&gt;&lt;ref name="basu"&gt;{{cite web| author=Somnath Basu| url=http://retireeincome.com/resources/files/Age_Banding.pdf| title=Age Banding: A Model for Planning Retirement Needs| publisher=Financial Counseling and Planning, Vol. 16, No. 1| date=2005| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120803044009/http://www.retireeincome.com/resources/files/Age_Banding.pdf| archive-date=August 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are probably several reasons for this. For retirees in reasonable health, this age is approximately when natural aging processes lead to a slower pace of living (this is Michael Stein's ''Slow-Go'' stage&lt;ref group="note" name="stein"/&gt;). It is also possible that they chose this age to match the [[Surveys of retirement spending#U.S. Consumer Expenditure Survey (CE) | BLS Consumer Expenditure]] tables, which break down their retiree data into age groupings of 65-74 and 75+.

Other authors believe that variations in retiree life experiences and spending prevent fixing ages to the stage boundaries.&lt;ref name="cowell"/&gt; An common example is involuntary retirement. For people entering retirement involuntarily with insufficient financial resources, their spending could very quickly drop down to a low, Stage 3-like level even though they could be in their early 60s. Keeping this variation in mind, a good Stages of Retirement model should let you adjust boundary ages.

===Stages having constant real spending===
The very simplest Stages of Retirement model assume that the real spending &lt;u&gt;within&lt;/u&gt; each Stage is constant. All changes in real spending occur &lt;u&gt;between&lt;/u&gt; the stages. For the average retiree spending &lt;u&gt;drops&lt;/u&gt; at these boundaries. If it uses a budgeting approach to estimate the real spending within each stage, you can think of these as [[Budget models of retirement spending#Step change budgets | Step Change Budgets]]. But a changing (often dropping) replacement rate could just as easily be used to model each successive stage.&lt;ref group="note" name="tacchSaltz"/&gt;

This type of model can be made more realistic by further breaking down spending into budget categories within each stage. In his ''Age Banding'' model,&lt;ref name="basu"/&gt; Somnath Basu incorporates a separate budget for each of four broad expense categories: taxes, basic living, healthcare and leisure.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Most budget models do not consider taxes to be an independent budget item. Rather, they calculate taxes based on the income required to cover spending in the remaining categories.&lt;/ref&gt; At each of the stage boundaries his model allows a step change in real spending, either upwards, downwards or no change. For example, basic living expenses could be given step ''drops'' at each stage boundary, but healthcare given step ''increases'' at each boundary. Further, his model allows for a different inflation rate to be applied to each spending category within each stage.

===Stages having variable real spending===
Studies have also shown that retirees steadily reduce their spending as they age, rather than as a series of sharp drops. Following on from this, several retirement planners have suggested that Stages of Retirement models can be made even more realistic by allowing real spending to vary gradually within one or more of the stages.

'''Tacchino &amp; Saltzman'''. A very widely cited paper that suggested incorporating a steady spending drop into retirement planning calculations was published in 1999 by Kenn Tacchino and Cynthia Satlzman.&lt;ref group="note" name="tacchSaltz"/&gt; Arguing from the [[Surveys of retirement spending#U.S. Consumer Expenditure Survey (CE) | U.S. Consumer Expenditure]] survey data, they concluded:

{{blockquote|... all available data and research indicate that there is a gradual reduction in spending starting shortly after retirement. Spending decreases are natural, voluntary and acceptable, and should be reflected in the client's accumulation model. The downward adjustment in spending by age 75 is approximately 20 percent of the initial spending levels during retirement that starts at age 65.}}

This 20% reduction (2.2% annually) is an average across all retiree income levels. They also show that ''real spending drops for every income range'' within the BLS survey data, although the percentage decrease varies in a somewhat random fashion.

Tacchino and Saltzman did not particularly emphasize using a continual (annual) real spending reduction until age 75. They spent more time presenting ways in which stage models having constant spending could be modified to approximate the steady spending decreases. But they did state that a retirement calculation incorporating a real spending drop &lt;u&gt;each&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;year&lt;/u&gt; would lead to a better estimate for the total savings needed at retirement.

'''Ty Bernicke's ''Reality Retirement Planning'''. Ty Bernicke published a widely cited paper ''Reality Retirement Planning: A New Paradigm for an Old Science'' in 2005.&lt;ref name="bernicke"/&gt; In it he emphasized using a steady, real spending reduction in each successive year of retirement until age 75. Real spending was assumed to remain constant in stages after age 75. His arguments were (again) based on data from the [[Surveys of retirement spending#U.S. Consumer Expenditure Survey (CE) | BLS Consumer Expenditure Surveys]].

In his paper Bernicke recommends using a 50% spending drop between the 55-59 age group and age 75. A sample calculation presented used an annual real spending drop of 3.7%. ''This is certainly too large''. Referring back to Table 1 in this paper, it can be seen that the &lt;u&gt;raw&lt;/u&gt; Total Consumer Expenditure dollar amounts from the 2002 CE Survey were used. These dollar amounts included savings dollars (Social Security payroll taxes and personal retirement savings) which should have been subtracted out before estimating the percentage spending drop.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The BLS Consumer Expenditure Survey tables consider retirement savings to be an "expenditure", just like spending on food and housing are expenditures. This makes sense from the survey’s perspective, since the goal is to account for every after-tax dollar received by a household. But from a retirement planning perspective, only the categories of spending that will persist throughout retirement are of interest.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, there was no correction for the different average household sizes between the age groups (i.e. 2.1 persons for age 55-59 versus 1.5 persons for age 75+). Incorporating these corrections would have reduced the predicted spending drop by age 75.

'''Recommended Annual Spending Drop'''. Bernicke's annual percentage drop of 3.7% until age 75 is too large. The equivalent annual spending drop from Tacchino and Saltzman, 2.2%, is much lower and probably closer to the truth. Fisher and others have analyzed the same Consumer Expenditure Survey data and recommended using a 1% annual real spending drop until the late 70s.&lt;ref name="fisher"/&gt;

The BLS Consumer Expenditure Survey does not supply the best database for analyzing drops in real spending as retirement progresses. This is because the BLS survey does not follow the same households in each successive year. Changes in spending patterns with aging can only be derived by comparing shifting averages in large populations of households. It would be much better to perform retiree spending studies using the [[Surveys of retirement spending#The Health and Retirement Study (HRS) survey | Health and Retirement Study]] survey database. In this biennial survey the same households are followed from age 51-56 until death. Unfortunately there appear to be no no such studies of retiree spending patterns.

'''William Bengen’s ''Prosperous Retirement'''''. Published in 2001, Bengen’s ''Prosperous Retirement'' model&lt;&lt;ref name="bernicke"/&gt; and William Bengen’s ''Prosperous Retirement'' model&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=William P. Bengen| url=http://www.bobsfinancialwebsite.com/pdfs/Conserving_Client_Portfolios_During_Retirement_Part_IV.pdf| title=Conserving Client Portfolios During Retirement, Part IV| publisher=Journal; of Financial Planning| date=2001| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110910231853/http://www.bobsfinancialwebsite.com/pdfs/Conserving_Client_Portfolios_During_Retirement_Part_IV.pdf| archive-date=September 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; is aimed at retirees whose spending early in retirement is higher than average. This is in contrast to the previous two models that targeted a more "average" retiree. This model has three Phases: ''Active'', ''Transition'' and ''Passive''. In the Active Phase (until age 75), the model assumes a constant real spending. In the Transition Phase the model has a &lt;u&gt;strongly&lt;/u&gt; declining real spending each year until age 85. (The example in the paper used 4% below inflation annually.) In the Passive Phase the model has a &lt;u&gt;weakly&lt;/u&gt; declining real spending each year until death. (The example in the paper used 2% below inflation annually, which gave a slightly increasing nominal spending each year.)

===Comparison with retiree spending===
Using three (or four) Stages of Retirement, each of which can have a different real spending, models retiree spending patterns much better. All three of the basic patterns discussed earlier in the [[#Retiree spending: key observations | Key Observations]] section can be mimicked. And if the first one or two stages allow a gradual annual spending drop rather than just a constant real spending, then an even better match to actual retiree spending is possible.

===Use in retirement calculators===
Calculators with a Stages of Retirement spending model are much less common than those with constant real spending model. Only a few of the calculators in the [[Retirement calculators and spending]] article explicitly include this model. Some of these include Ty Bernicke’s ''Reality Retirement Planning'' approach.

Although the documentation for only one of calculators explains how (the [http://www.flexibleretirementplanner.com/index.htm Flexible Retirement Planner]), it &lt;u&gt;is&lt;/u&gt; usually possible to set up a Stages of Retirement model with any calculator having a [[#Flexible spending models | Flexible Spending]] capability. Each spending Stage (start age, stop age and constant real spending amount) is modeled using one of the custom spending inputs. To make this calculate properly, you may need to set the initial spending budget to $0.

==Investment returns-dependent models==
It unsurprising that retirees would cut back on their spending during times when they do not feel financially secure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Kevin J. Lansing| url=https://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/publications/economic-letter/2011/july/impact-great-recession/| title=Gauging the Impact of the Great Recession| publisher=FRBSF Economic Letter| date=July 11, 2011| accessdate=September 1, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; For someone who is retired and who has stock market investments, stock bear markets would motivate them to reduce spending. Conversely, if they feel financially secure (for example, during a stock bull market), they would probably increase their real spending.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Lonnie K Stevans| url=http://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1007&amp;context=lonniekstevans&amp;sei-redir=1#search=%22spending%20changes%20stock%20market%22| title=Aggregate consumption spending, the stock market and asymmetric error correction| publisher=Quantitative Finance, Vol. 4| date=2004}}{{dead link}}&lt;/ref&gt; These periods of increased and decreased spending can be modeled by [[Withdrawal Methods]] that depend on on either the previous year’s total savings or its investment return. An extensive summary of these methods is given on the [http://web.archive.org/web/20100628050004/http://www.bobsfinancialwebsite.com/VariableWithdrawals.html Variable Withdrawals in Retirement] (archived page from the ''Bob's Financial Website'').

A [[#Dual budget models | Dual Budget]] model is a natural complement to variable withdrawal methods. The ''Essential'' budget spending level would set a lower limit on spending as retirement progressed. The ''Preferred'' budget spending level would set a corresponding upper limit on spending. These constraints combine with those of the withdrawal model, providing a better approximation of the retirement savings needed. But since the Dual budget is an [[Introduction to retirement spending models#Initial retirement spending | initial spending model]], some method of extrapolating the spending across the retiree’s lifetime must be used.

It seems reasonable to extrapolate the Essential budget component of a Dual budget model using [[#Constant (real) spending models | constant real spending]]. If you were living at your minimum acceptable level, you would expect your nominal to grow at around the rate of inflation (constant real spending) as you are forced to pay ever increasing market prices for essential goods.

Extrapolating the Preferred budget component using a constant spending model is not reasonable, for all the reasons [[#Comparison with retiree spending | previously discussed]]. Instead, the Preferred budget should be extrapolated using either a [[#Stages of retirement models | Stages of Retirement]] model or a [[#Flexible spending models | Flexible Spending]] model. Both allow a more realistic description of how actual retirees alter their real spending as they age.

===Comparison with retiree spending===
By itself an Investment Returns Dependent spending model cannot adequately describe the key observations on retiree spending discussed in the Introduction. It cannot match the steady decline in real spending as retirees age. But it &lt;u&gt;does&lt;/u&gt; supply an element of reality that other models lack: the ability to reflect how retirees alter their spending in response to changes in their net worth. A combination of these two spending tendencies would be very beneficial.

A useful analogy is to think of waves on the ocean as the tide goes out. The waves would represent the investment return-dependent spending and the tide going out would represent the steady decline in spending as the retiree ages. The waves raising and lower the ocean surface level, but do not change the more powerful effect of the lowering tide. But without including both effects, the water level at any instant cannot be measured accurately. Similarly, retiree spending in any year is better described by combining these spending models.

===Use in retirement calculators===
Calculators having an Investment Returns Dependent spending model are much less common than those using a constant real spending model. However, referring to the [[Retirement calculators and spending | Calculators and Spending]] article shows that more calculators incorporate some variation of this model than those explicitly incorporating a Retirement Stages model.

|

*Less able to mimic the broad range of retiree spending patterns than a Stages of Retirement or a Flexible Spending model.
|}

==Flexible spending models==
A ''Flexible Spending'' model allows a total spending plan to incorporate multiple individual spending categories. Usually there is no need to enter every conceivable budget category as a separate spending item. Rather, these models usually let you first enter a base spending amount from another model (Constant Spending, Stages of Retirement, and so on). Then you can enter any spending that still is not properly represented as a separate, individual spending item. Typically the only information required is the starting age, ending age and spending amount for each category.
 
This type of modeling flexibility is particularly important if you anticiapte one or more large expenses that occur only over a limited age range. The following situations are examples of where a Flexible Spending model would allow a closer match between actual and modeled spending:
*You plan to purchase expensive, individual medical insurance until they become eligible for a less expensive Medicare + Medigap combination at age 65.
*You want to explore how possibly needing to pay for several years of her mother’s long-term medical care might affect how long her own savings would last.
*You are close to retirement with mortgage payments lasting another 13 years, and want to incorporate this into your proposed retirement spending plan.
*You are 10 years from retirement and want to accumulate enough savings to enable you to buy a winter home in Arizona several years after retiring at age 65. You would keep your current home until age 75, then sell it.

A Flexible Spending model can incorporate these types of category-specific, step changes in real spending. At the same time other spending categories, for example basic living expenses, could be described using other models that provide a better match to fairly smooth spending changes.

Often you can use a Flexible Spending model to mimic the spending pattern of a [[#Stages of retirement models | Stages of Retirement]] spending model. You do this using one flexible spending category to contain all the spending within one of the retirement stages. Most Flexible Spending models assume constant real spending within each category, so the resulting Stages model would also have constant spending. But there are a few calculators that allow variable real spending within a flexible spending category.
 
If a retirement calculator provided a very large number of separate flexible spending entries, then you could even create a separate spending entry for each year of retirement.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Several of the purchased programs in [[Retirement calculators and spending]] support unique spending or income events for each year of retirement.&lt;/ref&gt; This would provide enough planning flexibility to cover almost any conceivable situation.

Robert Carlson has discussed the advantages to being able to accurately model large, periodic expenses in retirement.&lt;ref group="note" name="carlson2"/&gt; Examples of such periodic expenses are car purchases and major home appliance replacements. The simple approach is to use a "sinking fund", where the total cost of the item and its expected lifetime are used to calculate an effective annual cost.

But a more precise treatment would use a specially designed flexible spending category. This special category would accept the following data: the expense year, total cost, and expected lifetime. The spending model would then calculate all subsequent years in which a repeated purchase of that item would be anticipated, as well as the inflated cost in each of those years. This approach gives a more realistic projection of variable retirement spending. This level of modeling detail would let you incorporate tax bracket management into your retirement planning.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;This type of large purchase could require large withdrawals from a tax-deferred account (IRA, 401(k), or similar) to pay for them. In some cases these withdrawals would be large enough to push you into a higher tax bracket. A better option then would be to make a combination of withdrawals from both tax-deferred and Roth IRA accounts, so that you keep your taxable income in the lower tax bracket.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparison with retiree spending===
Provided there are enough flexible spending categories/entries available, this model can do an excellent job of representing the diversity of retiree spending patterns [[#Retiree spending: key observations | discussed earlier]]. But if it offers only a small number of categories or entries available, it cannot model a steady decline in retiree real spending through their late 70s or early 80s. At best a Stages of Retirement model equivalent with constant real spending is possible. But even in such a limiting situation the final spending estimate would be better than that from a constant real spending model.

===Use in retirement calculators===
Calculators with a Flexible Spending model are much less common than those with a constant real spending model. However, the [[Retirement calculators and spending]] article offers a handful of free calculators that do include variations of this model. Most paid-for retirement calculators have this spending model.

*Additional effort required to incorporate this model into a retirement calculator.

==Life Cycle models==
''Life Cycle'' models calculate how a household should smooth their discretionary spending over their entire lifetime, not just in retirement.&lt;ref group="note" name="StratFinPlanning"&gt;Described in: N.Charupat, H. Huang and M. Milevsky, ''Strategic Financial Planning Over the Lifecycle'', (Cambridge University Press, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; Because they typically make a distinction between ''essential'' spending and ''discretionary'' spending, they are conceptually connected to [[Budget models of retirement spending#Dual budget models | Dual Budget models]] of retirement spending. Life Cycle models provide a detailed spending and savings plan to followin in the pre-retirement years. Doing this gives an optimized, real spending lifestyle for both the pre-retirement as well as the post-retirement years.

Spending predictions from Life Cycle models may sometimes be similar to spending in Constant Real Spending models, because in a few cases both will recommend a constant real spending in retirement. But further investigation reveals a deep difference in their fundamental approach. A Life Cycle model predicts how a household should smooth their discretionary spending over their &lt;u&gt;entire&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;lifetime&lt;/u&gt;, not just in retirement.&lt;ref name="kotlikoff"/&gt; [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/utility.asp Utility theory] predicts that people would be happiest if they neither over-spend nor under-spend each year as they age, whether retired or not. Starving now to ensure a comfortable retirement makes no more sense than splurging now and starving in retirement.

It is difficult to estimate how much you would need to save each year ''before'' retirement so that you could maintain a comparable lifestyle each year ''after'' retirement, especially if you have to account for uncertain future investment return, life span, and health care expenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author1=John Scholz| author2=Ananth Seshadri| author3=Surachai Khitatrakun| url=http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~scholz/Research/Optimality.pdf| title=Are Americans Saving "Optimally" for Retirement?| publisher=Journal of Political Economy, Vol. 114| date=2006}}{{dead link}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calculators offering the Life Cycle approach overcome these difficulties using [[wikipedia:Dynamic programming|Dynamic programming]].
 
The following table summarizes the main differences between the Life Cycle model and other spending models:&lt;ref name="kotlikoff"/&gt;

A Life Cycle model sometimes predicts a constant real spending during retirement, for example when longevity risk aversion is ignored and a fixed (deterministic) retirement lifespan is assumed.&lt;ref group="note" name="StratFinPlanning"/&gt; But even in this restrictive case you should not think of that spending level as an unchanging quantity to be spent each year regardless of how retirement investments perform. Rather, the Life Cycle model calculation should be run ''every year'', so that its optimal spending prediction adjusts for investment performance.&lt;ref name="kotlikoff"/&gt; In this sense a Life Cycle model is different from a constant spending or withdrawal model set up using a [[Safe Withdrawal Rates]] approach.

When a Life Cycle model is run using more realistic assumptions (for example, a probabilistic retiree lifespan combined with longevity risk aversion), it predicts that the retiree should reduce their real spending as they age.&lt;ref name="PlanetVulcan"&gt;{{cite web| author1=Moshe Milevsky| author2=Huaxiong Huang| url=http://www.ifid.ca/pdf_workingpapers/Spending_Retirement_Vulcan_14MAR2010.pdf| title=Spending Retirement on Planet Vulcan: The impact of longevity risk aversion on optimal withdrawal rates| publisher=Financial Analysts Journal, Vol. 67, No. 2| date=2011| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121115060137/http://www.ifid.ca/pdf_workingpapers/Spending_Retirement_Vulcan_14MAR2010.pdf| archive-date=November 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lower the retiree's longevity risk aversion (that is, their fear of outliving their savings), the more they will pull real spending forward into the earlier years of retirement. Of course, this retiree lived an unexpectedly long time, they would need to significantly reduce their real spending late in retirement. But stating that the retiree's longevity risk aversion is low means that they are not particularly bothered by this possibility.

Life Cycle models of retirement spending can readily incorporate pension-like sources of retirement income that canot be out-lived, such as [[Social Security | U.S. Social Security]] benefits, [[Defined Benefit Pension Plan | Defined Benefit pensions]], and [[Immediate Fixed Annuity - SPIA | immediate fixed annuity]] payments (SPIAs). When such sources of income are included, it is observed that the optimal Portfolio Withdrawal Rate (PWR) from the retiree's personal savings depends on their longevity risk avesion and on their level of pension-like income. The larger the amount of the preexisting pension income, the preater the PWR is and thus the greater is the optimal consumption rate.&lt;ref name="PlanetVulcan"/&gt;

===Comparison with retiree spending===
If they use a fixed retiree lifespan and no longevity risk aversion, Life Cycle models predict a constant (real) discretionary spending target throughout retirement. This is clearly different from the average retiree spending patterns [[#Retiree spending: key observations | discussed earlier]]. But when Life Cycle models use more realistic assumptions (for example, longevity risk aversion and probabilistic lifespans), they correctly predict that real spending decreases with age.

Economic theory predicts that people should attempt to maintain a constant consumption rather than a constant spending.&lt;ref name="hurst"/&gt; For example, spending on food tends to drop sharply after retirement. However, careful studies have shown no change in food consumption; that is the amount and quality of the food they eat remains the same. Because retirees choose to spend more time preparing their food, they therefore need to spend less money. Similar trade-offs doubtlessly affect other budget categories, especially as retirees make use of the ubiquitous "Senior Discount." Ideally, a Life Cycle model should recognize this difference between smoothed lifetime consumption (the actual goal) and smoothed lifetime spending (a simple proxy).

As for retirees who plan on sharply ''increasing'' real spending after retirement for extensive travel and other expensive leisure activities, the Life Cycle model simply says: ''Why wait? Enjoy some of these activities while you’re young!'' The Life Cycle model will help you determine how much of the leisure activity expense can be pulled ahead before retirement.

===Use in retirement calculators===
Calculators include Life Cycle models less frequently than other spending models. This is unsurprising, given the complex programming required to implement the model. Some retirement calculators partially implement the Life Cycle concepts, which simplifies their programming. [[Retirement calculators and spending]] shows only a few calculators that either fully or partially incorporate the Life Cycle approach. ESPlanner and ESPlannerPLUS implements this fully. Optimal Retirement Planner, being a free program, not surprisingly has only a partial implementation of these characteristics. But it is still a very powerful calculator.

When most people think of retirement planning, one of their first questions is, "''What will it cost me to live as a retiree?''" Answering this question can seem overwhelming. This article aims to help answer this question by describing '''models of retirement spending'''.

Investors primarily use retirement spending models to estimate the Total Personal Savings they will need at retirement. The calculation needs to include price inflation. Often, nominal retirement spending is split into two independent components: ''real'' spending, and an inflation adjustment. This article deals only with the ''real'' spending component. For inflation, see: [[Inflation and retirement spending]].

Estimating your retirement spending is easier if you break it down into two steps. First, estimate an ''initial spending'' at the start of retirement; and second, extrapolate that as retirement progresses until eventual death.

== Overview ==
=== Initial spending ===
Generally, two types of models ''initial spending'':
*'''[[#Replacement rate models | Replacement rate]]''' (or ''ratio'') models estimate the total income needed in retirement by multiplying total income &lt;u&gt;before&lt;/u&gt; retirement by a constant, the ''replacement rate''. Generic estimates for the replacement rate range from 0.7 to 0.85, but you can find more personalized replacement rates in tables published by the GSU/Aon RETIRE Project.
*'''Budget''' or '''Expense''' models have various forms. They all estimate total retirement spending by working with estimates of spending in numerous, smaller budget categories. The most common type of budgeting approach uses a [[#Single budget models | Single budget]] to describe all retirement expenses. Using a [[#Dual budget models | Dual budget]] (with a lower ''essential'' spending and a higher ''preferred'' spending) give you a more flexible framework for extrapolating spending as retirement progresses.

=== Extrapolation ===
Models that extrapolate spending until death usually build on estimates from one of the ''initial spending'' models. These models group into five broad categories:
*'''[[Introduction to retirement spending models#Constant (real) spending models | The Constant (Real) Spending]]''' model assumes that the real spending at the start of retirement continues unchanged until death. Although this approach is widely used, it does not match a typical retiree's spending pattern. It usually (but not always) overestimates the savings needed at retirement.
*'''[[Introduction to retirement spending models#Stages of retirement models |The Stages of Retirement]]''' model breaks up retirement into three or four age ranges, each of which has a different real spending pattern. Spending within each range can be constant, or it can vary. This model does a much better job of representing retirees' diverse spending patterns.
*'''[[Introduction to retirement spending models#Investment returns dependent models |Investment Returns Dependent]]''' models allow retirement spending to vary based on how total savings or investment returns change over time. These models are best combined with Dual Budget models of initial retirement spending. These models match retirees' tendency to vary spending based on their net worth.
*'''[[Introduction to retirement spending models#Flexible spending models |Flexible Spending]]''' models allow you to incorporate numerous individual categories of spending into a total spending plan. Each spending category can have its own start and stop age, as well as spending amount. This model is excellent at representing large step changes in spending during retirement. Many retirement calculators will combine elements of this model with others already described. This combination supplies a very flexible framework for accurately describing a diverse range of retiree spending patterns.
*'''[[Introduction to retirement spending models#Life Cycle models | Life Cycle]]''' models calculate how a household should smooth their spending over their entire lifetime, not just in retirement; they provide a detailed spending and savings plan that you can use before retirement. Doing this gives you a similar lifestyle both before and after retirement.

There are several retirement calculators that implement these models. For some specific examples, see: [[Retirement calculators and spending]].

==Introduction==
Answering the question "''What will it cost me to live as a retiree?''" can seem overwhelming for many people. Coming up with an exact answer is probably impossible, because there are simply too many future unknowns.

But that does not mean that you cannot create a useful estimate of retirement spending. Some guidelines can help you do this. These guidelines are ''models of retirement spending''.

When thinking about future retirement spending, there is always a question of how much detail to put into the models and guidelines. This question is at the heart of any [[wikipedia:Economic model|Economic model]]: ''How much can the real situation be simplified and yet still be useful?''. There are many models of retirement spending, ranging from the extremely simple to the detailed and complex. This article reviews the main modeling approaches, explains their key simplifying assumptions, and gives a general feel for their strengths and weaknesses.

===Safe Withdrawal Rates===
Many studies on retirement spending start with an estimate of future retirement savings and then estimate the spending that might be ''achievable'' in retirement. They often focus on estimating the maximum spending that will not lead to exhausting your savings too early, the so-called [[Safe Withdrawal Rates | safe withdrawal rate]]. These models treat the maximum amount of ''savings'' as an ''independent'' variable. They adjust spending adjusted so that savings last as long as planned.

This article series works from the other side of the equation and treats retirement spending as the ''independent'' variable in the retirement planning process. You first develop an estimate of your ''desired'' spending in retirement. From there, the planning process makes assumptions about your longevity, inflation and investment returns, and then estimates the future savings you would need to sustain that retirement spending.

===Inflation===
This discussion excludes the effects of inflation on your retirement spending.

This is not meant to imply that inflation is an unimportant consideration. Just the opposite, '''''inflation is probably the retiree’s worst enemy!'''''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=John Howe| url=http://ezinearticles.com/?Inflation---A-Retirees-Worst-Enemy&amp;id=1306235| title=Inflation – A Retiree’s Worst Enemy| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190118034716/http://ezinearticles.com/?Inflation---A-Retirees-Worst-Enemy&amp;id=1306235| archive-date=January 18, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Scott Pearson | url=https://www.stardem.com/news/article_1d660d64-af58-5ba3-b28a-83bbe226760e.html| title=Inflation: The greatest enemy of your retirement plan| date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; But most retirement planning approaches treat inflation as an independent, adjustable variable. That way, they separate nominal retirement spending into two components: ''real'' spending,&lt;ref group="note"&gt;In economics ''real'' refers to the purchasing power net of any price changes over time. For more, see [[wikipedia:Real versus nominal value (economics)|Real versus nominal value (economics)]], from Wikipedia.&lt;/ref&gt; and inflation adjustments.

This article follows the same approach. For details on inflation adjustments, see: [[:Inflation and retirement spending]].

===Retirement calculator models===
There is a strong connection between retirement spending models and retirement planning calculators. Most retirement planning software, either explicitly or implicitly, assumes some model of retirement spending. The software's adjustable options reflect the choice of spending model.

Unfortunately, some retirement calculators, although they have many great strengths, are needlessly weak in incorporating retirement expenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author1=John Turner| author2=Hazel Witte| url=http://www.soa.org/files/pdf/research-pen-retire-planning-soft.pdf| title=Retirement Planning Software and Post-Retirement Risks| publisher=The Society of Actuaries| date=2009}}{{dead link}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Retirement planning software's usefulness is limited by its least realistic assumption. It is not useful to develop retirement software having numerous investment type choices along with a detailed Monte Carlo treatment of potential future returns, but then estimate real retirement spending with only a simple replacement rate model.

The [[Retirement calculators and spending]] article contains an extensive list of calculators, categorized by the retirement spending model(s) they use. Refer to this article for real-world examples of the spending models discussed here.

===Organization===
Classifying retirement spending models is useful because it emphasizes similarities and differences. This article uses the following classification to organize retirement spending models:

&lt;u&gt;Initial Retirement Spending&lt;/u&gt;
*Replacement Rate models
*Single Budget models
*Dual Budget models

&lt;u&gt;Spending as Retirement Progresses&lt;/u&gt;
*Constant (Real) Spending models
*Stages of Retirement models
*Investment Returns Dependent models
*Flexible Spending models
*Life Cycle models

==Initial retirement spending==
These models develop an estimate anticipated spending early in retirement, often focusing on spending for the very first year of retirement. There are three main approaches for developing this estimate:&lt;ref group="note" name="tacchino"&gt;For details, see: Kenn B. Tacchino, "Determining the Amount a Client Needs for Retirement," Chapter 5 in ''Financial Decisions for Retirement'', (The American College Press, 2005), pp5.1-5.55.&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Replacement rate'' (or ''ratio'') models
# ''Single budget'' (or ''expense'') models
# ''Dual budget'' models

===Replacement rate models===
''Replacement rate'' (or ''ratio'') models are the simplest and most generic approach to estimating retirement spending. Rather than directly estimating spending, replacement rate models estimate pre-tax, gross income after retirement. This model is based on the following equation:

::'''Gross Income''' (retired) &amp;nbsp; '''='''&amp;nbsp; '''Gross Income''' (pre-retirement) &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;times;&amp;nbsp; Replacement Rate'''

Assuming you have an idea of your gross income just ''before'' retirement, you only need a replacement rate ''multiplier'' to derive a gross income just ''after'' retirement. If you need an actual retirement spending amount, you can calculate it from the gross income by subtracting federal, state and local taxes.

In its simplest form, this model assigns the same replacement rate to everyone: 0.75 being a commonly suggested value (that is, you need 75% of your pre-retirement income for retirement), but sometimes a range of 0.70 to 0.85 is suggested.&lt;ref group="note" name="tacchino"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| publisher=U.S. Office of Personnel Management| url=http://www.opm.gov/retire/tools/calculators/ballpark/ReplacementRate.asp| title=Desired Replacement Rate| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111112085011/http://www.opm.gov/retire/tools/calculators/ballpark/ReplacementRate.asp| archive-date=November 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This type of replacement rate model is extremely generic, and for many retirees it is the least accurate. Replacement rates change with key household characteristics such as gross income and marital status.&lt;ref name="retire"&gt;{{cite web| author=Bruce A. Palmer| url=http://rmictr.gsu.edu/Papers/RR08-1.pdf| title=2008 GSU / Aon RETIRE Project Report| publisher=Center for Risk Management and Insurance Research (Georgia State Univ.)| date=2008| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140123135351/http://rmictr.gsu.edu/Papers/RR08-1.pdf| archive-date=January 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aon"&gt;{{cite web| publisher=Aon Consulting| url=https://www.aon.com/about-aon/intellectual-capital/attachments/human-capital-consulting/RRStudy070308.pdf| title=2008 Replacement Ratio Study: A Measurement Tool for Retirement Planning| date=2008| accessdate=August 29, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; For tables containing these less generic replacement rates, as well as a more detailed discussion, see: [[Replacement rate models of retirement spending]].

Although many free online retirement planning calculators use the replacement rate model,&lt;ref group="note" name="calcExamp"&gt;See [[Retirement calculators and spending]] for specific examples.&lt;/ref&gt; these calculators are typically very simple. Even when using simple online calculators, replacement rates from the GSU/Aon tables are better than a generic estimate (for example, using 0.75 for everyone). If you are using a more detailed retirement calculator, adjust the GSU/Aon replacement rates to increase their accuracy.

*Provides a quick and easy estimate of gross income in retirement.
*Well suited for use by people who are far from retirement.&lt;ref group="note" name="tacchino"/&gt; The uncertainties in the GSU/Aon replacement rates will likely be similar to uncertainties in other aspects of the retirement plan.
|
*GSU/Aon replacement rates need further adjustments for best accuracy.
*Require a supplemental calculation to obtain after-tax spending.
*People far from retirement will need to estimate their gross income just before retirement in order to use replacement rates.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;You estimate this gross income by either extrapolating your current income using historical wage growth from the [https://www.ssa.gov/oact/cola/AWI.html National Average Wage Index], or by replacing current income with that of someone in the same profession who is close to retirement.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Generally less accurate than a Budget model approach for people who are close to retirement.&lt;ref group="note" name="tacchino"/&gt;
|}

===Single budget models===
''Budget'' (or ''expense'') models come in various forms. Their common factor is that they estimate total retirement spending by working with estimates of spending in numerous, smaller budget categories. The most common type of budgeting approach uses a ''single budget'' for all retirement expenses.

There are two typical approaches to obtain a single budget spending estimate: ''Current Spending'', and ''Bottom-up''.

''Current Spending'' starts with your total (current) spending just &lt;u&gt;before&lt;/u&gt; retirement.&lt;ref name="anspach"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.thebalancemoney.com/how-to-estimate-your-retirement-expenses-2388830| title=How to Estimate Your Retirement Expenses| publisher=the balance| date=October 23, 2021| accessdate=August 29, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; You then examine each spending category to see what adjustments, either up or down, you anticipate on retirement. These spending adjustments are incorporated to arrive at a total spending just &lt;u&gt;after&lt;/u&gt; retirement.

''Bottom-up'' develops a personalized spending budget from scratch by estimating your retirement spending for every conceivable budget category.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;See: Walter Updegrave, "Create a Retirement Plan That Works for You", chapter 5 in ''We’re Not in Kansas Anymore: Strategies for Retiring Rich in a Totally Changed World'' (Crown Business Publishers, 2004) 304pp.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note" name="carlson"&gt;For details, see: Robert C. Carlson, "How Much Will You Need", Chapter 3 in ''The New Rules of Retirement: Strategies for a Secure Future'', (John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 2004) 288 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; You should use a detailed budget worksheet to make sure that you do not overlook any category of retirement spending. Summing these category estimates gives a total spending estimate. This approach is more time consuming than the Current Spending approach, but can give you a better estimate. It also gives a better starting point for projecting how the budget might change as your retirement progresses.

For links to detailed worksheets useful for developing a single budget spending model, see [[Budget models of retirement spending]]. Many retirement planning calculators also incorporate worksheets for developing budget spending estimates.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Examples of retirement planning calculators which use a built-in budget worksheet include the [https://www.troweprice.com/usis/advice/tools/retirement-income-calculator T. Rowe Price Retirement Income Calculator], the [http://www.retirementoptimizer.com/ Otar Retirement Calculator] and the [https://www.askebsa.dol.gov/retirementcalculator/UI/general.aspx U.S. Dept. of Labor Retirement Calculator].&lt;/ref&gt; However it is better to develop the budget using an independent, detailed worksheet. This minimizes the possibility that you overlook important spending categories. For example, spending on big but infrequent purchases is very important,&lt;ref group="note" name="carlson" /&gt; but most calculators' built-in worksheets often omit this.

*Can supply more accurate spending estimates than a replacement rate model.
*Better for handling spending estimates for big, infrequent expenses than a replacement rate model.
*A Bottom-up budget model provides a particularly good starting point for incorporating real spending changes over time.
|
*Requires more time and effort than a replacement rate model.
*Realistic spending estimates are difficult to determine unless you are already tracking your personal spending.
|}

===Dual budget models===
''Dual Budget'' models are a direct extension of the Bottom-up budget model that incorporate &lt;u&gt;two&lt;/u&gt; total spending estimates.&lt;ref group="note" name="merriman"&gt;For details, see: Paul Merriman, ''Live it Up Without Outliving Your Money'', revised and updated edition (John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 2008), 206pp.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="modly"&gt;{{cite web| author=Helen Modly| url=http://advisor.morningstar.com/articles/fcarticle.asp?docId=4178| title=Helping Clients to Accurately Estimate Retirement Expenses| publisher=Morningstar Advisor| date=August 31, 2005}}{{dead link}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first or ''Essential'' budget is the lowest level of retirement spending that you can can accept. The second or ''Preferred'' budget is a higher level of retirement spending that you want. Your spending in any year is assumed to fall between these two budgets.

The easiest way to estimate the Dual budget models is to use worksheet designed to do this.&lt;ref name="modly"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.metlife.com/assets/ib/retirement/strategy/retirement-expense-worksheet.pdf| title=MetLife Retirement Income Worksheet| publisher=MetLife| date=2009| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812232402/http://www.metlife.com/assets/ib/retirement/strategy/retirement-expense-worksheet.pdf| archive-date=December 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each budget category on such a worksheet accepts two entries: an ''essential'' spending amount and a ''discretionary'' spending amount. Their sum gives the preferred budget spending estimate.

Dual budget spending models are particularly useful when combined with [[Withdrawal methods] that allow real spending to vary. Two examples are the ''Constant Percentage'' method and the ''Floor and Ceiling method''.&lt;ref&gt;For more on the Constant Percentage method, see: [[Withdrawal Methods]]. For more on the Floor and Ceiling method, see: [http://web.archive.org/web/20100628050004/http://www.bobsfinancialwebsite.com/VariableWithdrawals.html Variable Withdrawals in Retirement] (archived page from the ''Bob's Financial website'').&lt;/ref&gt; The Dual budget model has an added restriction on calculating total savings at retirement: your real spending cannot rise above the preferred budget nor fall below the essential budget.

Life Cycle models of spending indirectly use Dual budgets. These optimize your discretionary spending (this is your spending above your ''essential'' budget) across your entire remaining lifespan, both before and after retirement.&lt;ref group="note" name="StratFinPlanning"&gt;Described in: N.Charupat, H. Huang and M. Milevsky, ''Strategic Financial Planning Over the Lifecycle'', (Cambridge University Press, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; In Life Cycle models the sum of the ''essential'' and the ''discretionary'' spending may be either less than or greater than an independently estimated ''preferred'' budget.

|
*Provides a more nuanced model of retiree spending that a single budget model.
*Better suited for combining with [[Withdrawal methods]] that allow variable real spending.

*More work to develop dual budget models than a single budget model.

==Spending as retirement progresses==
The models previously described supply a starting point for the more important problem of modeling how real spending changes as retirement progresses. A large number of such models have been proposed and incorporated into [[Retirement calculators and spending | retirement calculators]]. The section below summarizes these models. For more detailed descriptions of all the following models, see: [[Models of spending as retirement progresses]].

An important criterion for evaluating retirement spending models is how well they can describe the actual spending patterns of retirees. These actual spending patterns primarily come from various [[:Surveys of retirement spending]]. From these surveys, as well as from the practical experiences reported by professional financial planners, certain key facts are visible:
*The ''average retiree'' exhibits a slight drop in real spending at retirement, followed by a steady decline in real spending as they age into their late 70s or early 80s.&lt;ref name="fisher"&gt;{{cite web| author1=J. Fisher| author2=D. Johnson| author3=J. Marchand| author4=T. Smeeding| author5=B.

Tacchino and Cynthia Saltzman, "Do accumulation models overstate what’s needed to retire?", ''Journal of Financial Planning, Vol. 12'' (Feb. 1999), pp 62-74.&lt;/ref&gt;

They exhibit a sharp drop in real spending at retirement.&lt;ref name="hurst"/&gt; If involuntary retirement was health related, these retirees may subsequently exhibit a medical expense induced, real ''increase'' in total spending near their death.
*A smaller percentage of retirees (roughly 12%&lt;ref group="note" name="Hurd2"&gt;See: Michael Hurd and Susann Rohwedder, ''The Retirement Consumption Puzzle: Anticipated and Actual Declines in Retirement Spending'', NBER Working Paper 9586 (March 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;) exhibit an increase in real spending at retirement.&lt;ref group="note" name="stein"&gt;See: Michael Stein, ''The Prosperous Retirement: Guide to the New Reality'', (Emstco, LLC, 1998), 312 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="carlson1"&gt;{{cite web| author=Robert Carlson| url=https://www.retirementwatch.com/how-to-vary-spending-during-retirement| title=How to Vary Spending During Retirement| publisher=Bob Carlson’s Retirement Watch| date=October 17, 2017| accessdate=August 29, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is often driven by a jump in travel or other leisure activities. After a certain time period these special activities end, and real spending drops to a lower level, often closer to that of "average retirees."

===Constant (real) spending models===
This is the simplest of all approaches used to model spending as retirement progresses. It assumes that your real spending at the time of retirement will continue unchanged until death. It does not ignore inflation, but as explained in the Introduction, treats it as a separate, adjustable variable in the retirement planning process. In terms of spending, this model states that spending for any year in retirement equals spending in the first year multiplied by an inflation adjustment.

'''Comparison with Retiree Spending'''. Constant real spending models do not reflect the reality that the average retiree’s spending steadily drops during retirement. Many retirement planners have pointed this out as a major shortcoming.&lt;ref group="note" name="tacchSaltz" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bernicke"&gt;{{cite web| author=Ty Bernicke| url=http://www.bobsfinancialwebsite.com/pdfs/Reality_Retirement_Planning.pdf| title=Reality Retirement Planning: A New Paradigm for an Old Science| publisher=Journal of Financial Planning| date=2005| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100509041235/http://www.bobsfinancialwebsite.com:80/pdfs/Reality_Retirement_Planning.pdf| archive-date=May 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also point out that these models &lt;u&gt;overestimate&lt;/u&gt; the total savings needed at retirement.

A constant real spending model could be appropriate in if your retirement is involuntary and your financial resources are limited. This situation would force you to immediately drop down to an ''essentials only'' spending budget. If you were living at your minimum acceptable level, you would expect your nominal spending to grow at around the rate of inflation (constant real spending) as you are forced to pay ever increasing market prices for essential goods.

Although [[#Life Cycle models | Life Cycle]] spending models sometimes produce a constant real spending in retirement, they do this from an entirely different ''Economics Perspective''.&lt;ref name="kotlikoff"&gt;{{cite web| author=Laurence Kotlikoff| url=https://people.bu.edu/kotlikof/New%20Kotlikoff%20Web%20Page/Economics%20Approach%20to%20Fin%20Planning,%20JFP11-08-07%20posted%20Jan%203,%202008.pdf| title=Economics’ Approach to Financial Planning| publisher=Journal of Financial Planning| date=2008| accessdate=September 1, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; For more, see [[#Life Cycle models | Life Cycle models]] below.

'''Calculators'''. Free online retirement calculators most commonly use a Constant spending model. This is especially true for calculators that are deterministic, less so for those that use Monte Carlo or Historical Returns approaches. There are however some that let you choose different models. For more, see [[Retirement calculators and spending]].

*Easy to understand, so they are useful for illustrative (teaching) purposes.
*Easy to implement in a retirement calculator or spreadsheet.
|
*Does not match the reality of how average retirees spend money as they age.
*Often leads to an overestimation of the total savings needed at retirement.

===Stages of retirement models===
Studies have shown that a typical retirement splits into three to four ''Stages'' or ''Phases''.&lt;ref name="cowell"&gt;{{cite web| author1=M. Cowell| author2=R. Helman| author3=A. Rappaport| author4=S. Siegel| author5=J. Turner| url=http://www.soa.org/files/pdf/research-2007-findings-phases.pdf| title=The Phases of Retirement and Planning for the Unexpected| publisher=Society of Actuaries| date=2008}}{{dead link}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within each stage, retirees tend to exhibit similar patterns of physical activity and spending.&lt;ref group="note" name="carlson" /&gt;&lt;ref group="note" name="stein" /&gt; Stages of Retirement spending models account for this.

The very simplest Stages of Retirement model assume that the real spending &lt;u&gt;within&lt;/u&gt; each Stage is constant. All changes in real spending occur &lt;u&gt;between&lt;/u&gt; the stages. If set up to model spending dropping by ages 75-80, it approximates an average retiree spending pattern. If it uses a budgeting approach to estimate the real spending within each stage, you can think of these as [[Budget models of retirement spending#Step change budgets | Step Change Budgets]]. But a changing (often dropping) replacement rate could just as easily be used to model each successive stage.&lt;ref group="note" name="tacchSaltz" /&gt;

Studies have also shown that retirees steadily reduce their spending as they age, rather than as a series of sharp drops.&lt;ref name="fisher"/&gt;&lt;ref group="note" name="tacchSaltz" /&gt; Following on from this, several retirement planners have suggested that Stages of Retirement models can be made even more realistic by allowing real spending to vary gradually within one or more of the stages.Ty Bernicke’s ''Reality Retirement Planning'' model&lt;ref name="bernicke"/&gt; and William Bengen’s ''Prosperous Retirement'' model&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=William P.

'''Comparison with Retiree Spending'''. Using three to four Stages of Retirement, each of which can have a different real spending, allows much better modeling of retiree spending patterns. All three of the basic patterns [[:#Spending as retirement progresses | discussed earlier]] can be mimicked. And if the stages allow for a gradual annual spending drop rather than just a constant real spending, then an even better match to actual retiree spending is possible.

'''Calculators'''. Calculators with a Stages of Retirement spending model are much less common than those with constant real spending model. Only a few of the calculators in the [[Retirement calculators and spending]] article explicitly include this model. Some of these include Ty Bernicke’s ''Reality Retirement Planning'' approach.

* Allows the retirement calculation to incorporate diversity in retiree spending patterns with aging.
* Significantly improves model accuracy without excessively increasing complexity.
|
* Needs additional work to estimate budgets or replacement rates for each Stage.
* There is some uncertainty in the most realistic annual percentage spending drop to age 75.
* Somewhat more difficult to implement in a retirement calculator than constant real spending.

===Investment returns dependent models===
''Investment Returns Dependent'' models let retirement spending vary based on how total savings or investment returns change over time. It unsurprising that retirees would cut back on their spending during times when they do not feel financially secure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Kevin J. Lansing| url=https://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/publications/economic-letter/2011/july/impact-great-recession/| title=Gauging the Impact of the Great Recession| publisher=FRBSF Economic Letter| date=July 11, 2011| accessdate=September 1, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; For someone who is retired and who has stock market investments, stock bear markets would motivate them to reduce spending. Conversely, if they feel financially secure (for example, during a stock bull market), they would probably increase their real spending.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Lonnie K Stevans| url=http://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1007&amp;context=lonniekstevans&amp;sei-redir=1#search=%22spending%20changes%20stock%20market%22| title=Aggregate consumption spending, the stock market and asymmetric error correction| publisher=Quantitative Finance, Vol. 4| date=2004}}{{dead link}}&lt;/ref&gt; These periods of increased and decreased spending can be modeled by [[Withdrawal Methods]] that depend on on either the previous year’s total savings or its investment return. An extensive summary of these methods is given on the [http://web.archive.org/web/20100628050004/http://www.bobsfinancialwebsite.com/VariableWithdrawals.html Variable Withdrawals in Retirement] (archived page from the ''Bob's Financial Website'').

A '''[[#Dual budget models | Dual Budget]]''' model is a natural complement to variable withdrawal methods. The ''Essential'' budget spending level would set a lower limit on spending as retirement progressed. The ''Preferred'' budget spending level would set a corresponding upper limit on spending. These constraints combine with those of the withdrawal model, providing a better approximation of the retirement savings needed.

'''Comparison with Retiree Spending'''. By itself an Investment Returns Dependent spending model cannot adequately reflect the key observations on retiree spending [[:#Spending as retirement progresses | discussed earlier]]. It cannot match the steady decline in real spending as retirees age. But it &lt;u&gt;does&lt;/u&gt; supply an element of reality that other models lack: that is, it can reflect how retirees alter their spending in response to changes in their net worth. A combination of these two spending tendencies would be very beneficial.

'''Calculators'''. Calculators with an Investment Returns Dependent spending model are much less common than those using a constant real spending model. The [[Retirement calculators and spending]] article shows that more calculators have some variation of this model than those that have a Retirement Stages model.

{| class="wikitable"
! width="50%" | Strengths !! width="50%" | Weaknesses
|- valign="top"
|
*Reflects the tendency of retirees to adjust spending up or down as their net worth changes.
*Nicely complements variable withdrawal methods used to ensure savings survival in retirement.
*More realistic than a Constant Spending model.
|
*Does not match the reality that average retirees spend progressively less money as they age.
*Less able to mimic the broad range of retiree spending patterns than a Stages of Retirement or a Flexible Spending model.
|}

===Flexible spending models===
A ''Flexible Spending'' model allows a total spending plan to incorporate multiple individual spending categories. Usually there is no need to enter every conceivable budget category as a separate spending item. Rather, these models usually let you first enter a base spending amount from another model (Constant Spending, Stages of Retirement, and so on). Then you can enter any spending that still is not properly represented as a separate, individual spending item. Typically the only information required is the starting age, ending age and spending amount for each category.

This flexibility is particularly important if you anticipate one or more large expenses that would abruptly start or stop during retirement. Example include repaying a home mortgage, buying a vacation home, or paying for long-term medical care.

You can often use a Flexible Spending model to mimic the spending pattern of a [[#Stages of retirement models | Stages of Retirement]] spending model, by using one flexible spending category to contain all the spending within one of the retirement stages.

'''Comparison with Retiree Spending'''. Provided there are enough flexible spending categories/entries available, this model can do an excellent job of representing the diversity of retiree spending patterns [[#Spending as retirement progresses | discussed earlier]]. But if it offers only a small number of categories or entries available, it cannot model a steady decline in retiree real spending through their late 70s or early 80s.

'''Calculators'''. Calculators with a Flexible Spending model are much less common than those with a constant real spending model. However, the [[Retirement calculators and spending]] article offers a handful of free calculators that do include variations of this model. Most paid-for retirement calculators have this spending model.

{| class="wikitable"
! width="50%" | Strengths !! width="50%" | Weaknesses
|- valign="top"
|
*Can provide a personalized description of retirement spending for a broad range of retirees.
*Best model for handling large changes in spending that might occur at irregular times during retirement.
|
*Entering the personalized spending data can be very time consuming for some calculators.
*Not well suited for mimicking investment returns dependent retiree spending.
*Additional effort required to incorporate this model into a retirement calculator.

===Life Cycle models===
A ''Life Cycle'' model predicts how a household should smooth their discretionary consumption over their entire lifetime, not just in retirement.&lt;ref group="note" name="StratFinPlanning" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kotlikoff"/&gt; [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/utility.asp Utility theory] predicts that people would be happiest if they neither over-spend nor under-spend each year as they age, whether retired or not. Life Cycle models try to incorporate this. They account for all types of pre-retirement expenses, generating a year by year savings plan consistent with a lifetime of smoothed discretionary consumption.

It is difficult to estimate how much you would need to save each year ''before'' retirement so that you could maintain a comparable lifestyle each year ''after'' retirement, especially if you have to account for uncertain future investment return, life span, and health care expenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author1=John Scholz| author2=Ananth Seshadri| author3=Surachai Khitatrakun| url=http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~scholz/Research/Optimality.pdf| title=Are Americans Saving "Optimally" for Retirement?| publisher=Journal of Political Economy, Vol. 114| date=2006}}{{dead link}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calculators offering the Life Cycle approach overcome these difficulties using [[wikipedia:Dynamic programming|Dynamic programming]].

'''Comparison with Retiree Spending'''. If they use a fixed retiree lifespan and no longevity risk aversion, Life Cycle models predict a constant (real) discretionary spending target throughout retirement. This is clearly different from the average retiree spending patterns [[#Spending as retirement progresses | discussed earlier]]. But when Life Cycle models use more realistic assumptions (for example, longevity risk aversion and probabilistic lifespans), they correctly predict that real spending decreases with age.&lt;ref name="PlanetVulcan"&gt;{{cite web| author1=Moshe Milevsky| author2=Huaxiong Huang| url=http://www.ifid.ca/pdf_workingpapers/Spending_Retirement_Vulcan_14MAR2010.pdf| title=Spending Retirement on Planet Vulcan: The impact of longevity risk aversion on optimal withdrawal rates| publisher=Financial Analysts Journal, Vol. 67, No. 2| date=2011| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121115060137/http://www.ifid.ca/pdf_workingpapers/Spending_Retirement_Vulcan_14MAR2010.pdf| archive-date=November 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Calculators'''. Calculators include Life Cycle models less frequently than other spending models. This is unsurprising, given the complex programming required to implement the model. The [[Retirement calculators and spending]] article shows just a few calculators that use the Life Cycle model.

{| class="wikitable"
! width="50%" | Strengths !! width="50%" | Weaknesses
|- valign="top"
|
*Gives specific annual spending and saving goals both before and after retirement.
*Can recommend optimum age to start Social Security.&lt;ref name="kotlikoff"/&gt;
*Can fully integrate federal and state taxes into the calculation of optimal spending.&lt;ref name="kotlikoff"/&gt;
|
*Simple implementations that give a constant real spending will not match average retiree spending patterns.
*Complicated to implement fully.

==Overview==
A retirement plan that does not account for inflation and a decline in purchasing power could be successful at first but fail 10 to 15 years into retirement.&lt;ref&gt;Jamie Hopkins, [http://www.forbes.com/sites/jamiehopkins/2014/03/30/how-to-mitigate-inflation-risk-in-a-retirement-income-plan/#334358b21299 "How To Mitigate Inflation Risk In A Retirement Income Plan"], Forbes, March 30, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; When working your wages generally rise as the cost of goods and services increases; your earnings "keep pace with inflation". When you are living off savings, inflation literally robs you of income.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newretirement.com/Planning101/Inflation.aspx "Inflation - Inflation Can Devastate Even a Good Retirement Plan"], NewRetirement, retrieved August 1, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Just as inflation varies from country to country, inflation will also vary across regions, and goods and services. Some retirement income is better protected against inflation than others. For example, Social Security has an annual cost-of-living adjustment based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI). Delaying social security is good inflation protection because benefits increase up to age 70 and a larger percentage of retirement income will continue to be inflation protected.&lt;ref&gt;Jamie Hopkins, [http://www.forbes.com/sites/jamiehopkins/2014/03/30/how-to-mitigate-inflation-risk-in-a-retirement-income-plan/#334358b21299 "How To Mitigate Inflation Risk In A Retirement Income Plan"], Forbes, March 30, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically annual inflation in the U.S. has averaged 3.4% since 1914, but only 1.9% from 2006 — 2015. A recent report by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia forecasts that inflation will stay around that level for the next decade. The most commonly accepted measure of inflation is the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).&lt;ref&gt;Adam Zoll, [http://news.morningstar.com/articlenet/article.aspx?id=567105 "Don't Discount Inflation When Planning for Retirement"], September 10, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Rather than assuming that inflation will stay low before and during retirement, conservative investors use longer-term inflation numbers for planning; 3% is a reasonable starting point. Investors can also customize their inflation forecasts based on their actual consumption (see [[#Planning for inflation|below]]). For example, food costs are often a larger share of retirees' spending than for the general population, while housing costs may be a lower.&lt;ref&gt;Christine Benz, [http://news.morningstar.com/articlenet/article.aspx?id=682944 "4 Dangerous Assumptions That Could Hurt Your Retirement Plan"], ''Morningstar'', February 5, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inflation==

{{quotation|"Some idea of inflation comes from seeing a youngster get his first job at a salary you dreamed of as the culmination of your career." — Bill Vaughn&lt;br&gt;
"Inflation is when you pay fifteen dollars for a ten-dollar haircut you used to get for five dollars when you had hair." — Sam Ewing&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newretirement.com/Planning101/Inflation.aspx "Inflation Can Devastate Even a Good Retirement Plan"], NewRetirement, retrieved August 1, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Inflation is an increase in the prices of goods and services over time. When prices rise, currency buys fewer goods and services. Inflation reduces the purchasing power of money and decreases its nominal (inflation adjusted) value versus its real value. A measure of price inflation is the inflation rate, the annual percentage change in a price index over time. The opposite of inflation is deflation, or a price decrease over time.&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation "Inflation"], ''Wikipedia'', retrieved August 1, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Key inflation areas===

While the overall rate of inflation affects us all, retirees and those thinking about retirement need to be aware of how rising prices in a few key areas will affect their planning. 

'''Healthcare''': No other area better illustrates how spending habits change as we grow older. In a 2009 — 2010 BLS survey, households with members age 62 and older reported spending 11.3% of annual disposable income (that's income after taxes) on healthcare, including insurance. The average for all households, including the elderly, was 6.9%. Medical costs outpaced overall inflation from 1983 — 2012 except for 1996 according to the BLS, and medical costs grew 5.1% annually in that time frame.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Zoll, [http://news.morningstar.com/articlenet/article.aspx?id=567105 "Don't Discount Inflation When Planning for Retirement"], September 10, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; However, from 2006 — 2011 both the experimental CPI-Elderly (62 years and older) and the CPI-U rose at the same annual rate of 2.3%. This turnaround was caused by changes in medical care and shelter: the gap between medical care inflation and overall inflation has generally fallen since 2005, and shelter inflation has been rising more slowly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2012/ted_20120302.htm "Consumer Price Index for the elderly"], Bureau of Labor Statistics, March 2, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; 

'''Housing''': Senior households spend 44.5% of their disposable income on housing, including utilities, slightly above the 40.2% spent by the general population, according to the survey. Many retirees have homes that are paid off, and for those who don't but who currently pay fixed-rate mortgages, inflation needn't be a concern because payments will not rise. However, property taxes, insurance, home repair costs, and other homeowner expenses likely will. In 2011 property tax collections nationwide rose by only 1.2% due partly to depressed home values, but it was the first time they had risen below the rate of inflation since 1995. Retirees who rent homes also face the prospect of paying more as renting costs increase with inflation. 

'''Energy''': Though seniors tend to spend less on transportation, it remains a major expense, using 14.5% of disposable income vs. 16.5% for the overall population. Energy price volatility has become commonplace, with prices increasing an average of 4.6% per year from 2007 — 2012. Even for those who don't drive, inflation increases costs for travel, public transportation, and shipping. 

'''Food''': Senior households spend 12.8% of disposable income on food, about two points below the overall population. But, as with energy, volatility can cause spikes. From 2007 — 2012 food prices climbed 3.3% on average.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Zoll, [http://news.morningstar.com/articlenet/article.aspx?id=567105 "Don't Discount Inflation When Planning for Retirement"], September 10, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Inflation protection===

The possibility that inflation could increase argues for protecting your portfolio to preserve the purchasing power of future withdrawals. According to Christine Benz of ''Morningstar'', that means stocks, Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities, I-Bonds, commodities, precious metals, and real estate.&lt;ref&gt;Christine Benz, [http://news.morningstar.com/articlenet/article.aspx?id=682944 "4 Dangerous Assumptions That Could Hurt Your Retirement Plan"], ''Morningstar'', February 5, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; But there is something else to consider first.

'''Working Longer''': One of the best ways to reduce the potential risk of inflation is to delay retirement as long as possible. Salaries typically adjust quickly to high levels of inflation and many jobs offer annual cost of living increases. With a defined benefit plan, working longer can increase benefits that are tied to a higher average salary. Profit-sharing and 401(k) benefits do not adjust as rapidly to inflation in the last few years of employment.&lt;ref&gt;Jamie Hopkins, [http://www.forbes.com/sites/jamiehopkins/2014/03/30/how-to-mitigate-inflation-risk-in-a-retirement-income-plan/#334358b21299 "How To Mitigate Inflation Risk In A Retirement Income Plan"], Forbes, March 30, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stocks''': Stocks are considered the investor’s most reliable hedge against inflation, historically performing better than any other asset class, especially traditional bonds.&lt;ref&gt;Christine Benz, [http://news.morningstar.com/articlenet/article.aspx?id=682944 "4 Dangerous Assumptions That Could Hurt Your Retirement Plan"], ''Morningstar'', February 5, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; However, even stock performance against inflation suffers when it exceeds 5%. Over the long run a well diversified stock portfolio, including international stocks, can provide inflation protection.&lt;ref&gt;Jamie Hopkins, [http://www.forbes.com/sites/jamiehopkins/2014/03/30/how-to-mitigate-inflation-risk-in-a-retirement-income-plan/#334358b21299 "How To Mitigate Inflation Risk In A Retirement Income Plan"], Forbes, March 30, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''TIPS and I-Bonds''': Fixed income investments such as bonds, CDs, and others that guarantee a return can be significantly affected by inflation. If a bond offers 3.5% annual return nominally but annual inflation is 4%, the bond’s real interest rate is actually negative. [[Treasury Inflation Protected Security|Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS)]] and [[I savings bonds|I-Bonds]], however, offer inflation protection by adjustments based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI-U). Larry Swedroe has said that "the best hedge against unexpected inflation is Treasury Inflation Protection Securities (TIPS)".&lt;ref&gt;Larry Swedroe, [http://www.cbsnews.com/news/poking-holes-in-the-inflation-conspiracy-theory/ "Poking holes in the inflation conspiracy theory"], ''MONEYWATCH'', December 24, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

There may be less of a consensus on TIPS now, perhaps due to recency bias, as noted by Bogleheads&amp;reg; poster nedsaid:
{{blockquote|The standard advice here used to be to put half of your bonds into TIPS. In recent years, a lot of folks have soured on them and have either sold them outright or exchanged them for shorter term TIPS. During the time I have owned them, TIPS pretty much tracked other investment grade bonds. During the 2008-2009 financial crisis, TIPS dropped in value by over 10% and those of us who owned them were surprised by their volatility. 2016 has been a good year for TIPS but there was a stretch of time before that when they lagged the US Bond Index. Thus many soured on them. I am keeping my allocation of TIPS to guard against unexpected inflation.&lt;ref&gt;{{forum post|t=198065&amp;newpost=3027080#p3026871|title=TIPs, I've read the posts, still confused}}, retrieved August 23, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[Treasury Inflation Protected Security#Tax considerations|Bogleheads&amp;reg; Wiki]] notes that TIPS are not as tax efficient as I-Bonds, because the inflation adjustment and interest payments are taxable as ordinary income for federal income tax. For this reason it is often suggested that TIPS be held in a tax-advantaged account.&lt;ref&gt;[[Treasury Inflation Protected Security#Tax considerations|Treasury Inflation Protected Security Tax considerations]], Bogleheads&amp;reg; Wiki, retrieved August 24, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; dodecahedron compared TIPS to I-Bonds:{{blockquote|ibonds have several advantages vs. TIPS. In a taxable account, TIPS can present bookkeeping challenges while ibonds are simple. Also ibonds are tax-deferred (interest not due until you cash in) and they provide deflation as well as inflation protection. (TIPS provide some deflation protection if held to maturity but ibonds provide deflation protection no matter how long you hold them.) Finally ibonds may offer tax advantages if used for qualifying education expenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{forum post|t=198065&amp;newpost=3026913#p3026937|title=TIPs, I've read the posts, still confused}}, retrieved August 23, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Contrasting TIPS and I-Bonds in early 2024, Nisiprius wrote:&lt;ref&gt;{{forum post|t=|title=Re: TIPS vs iBonds|p=7824068|author=nisiprius|date=April 16, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{blockquote| The main difference between the two, and it is a huge one, comes in if you need money at a random time of your own choosing. For a TIPS, the only way you can get money from the Treasury is to wait until maturity. If you need money before then you must sell them into a fluctuating market. With an I bond, you can redeem them directly with the Treasury at any time from 1 to 30 years after you buy them, with no involvement in a fluctuating market.}}

'''Annuities''': Annuities can provide protection with a fixed annual increase in benefits (e.g., 5% per year) or a variable increase with an index like the CPI. However, purchasing inflation protection adds cost that can reduce returns.&lt;ref&gt;Jamie Hopkins, [http://www.forbes.com/sites/jamiehopkins/2014/03/30/how-to-mitigate-inflation-risk-in-a-retirement-income-plan/#334358b21299 "How To Mitigate Inflation Risk In A Retirement Income Plan"], Forbes, March 30, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; A Single Premium Immediate Annuity (SPIA) covering two to four decades of retirement should use an inflation-indexed income annuity or a graded income annuity with a higher (3% or 4%) annual income adjustment. See [[Immediate fixed annuity]] in the Bogleheads&amp;reg; Wiki.

'''Commodities''': Commodities provide inflation protection because they are CPI basket goods themselves, and they are also used to provide other basket goods: transportation and housing (gasoline and natural gas), home construction and durable goods (copper and aluminum), food (corn, coffee, and cocoa), clothing (cotton), and jewelry (gold and silver). Commodity indices also tend to be heavily weighted toward energy and food, providing protection for the two most volatile components of the CPI.&lt;ref&gt;Denis Chaves, [http://news.morningstar.com/articlenet/SubmissionsArticle.aspx?submissionid=201113.xml "Go for the Gold: Commodities and Inflation"], ''Morningstar'', December 11, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; See [[Commodities]] in the Bogleheads&amp;reg; Wiki; the Risk section is blank.

'''Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs)''': [[William Bernstein]] recommends considering REITs due to their low correlation with other financial markets.&lt;ref&gt;William J. Bernstein, ''The Four Pillars of Investing'', McGraw-Hill, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The Bogleheads&amp;reg; Wiki says "REITs are weakly correlated to inflation, due to their hard asset/rental income nature", but adds "if you are looking specifically for inflation protection, use individual TIPS, held to maturity"; see [[Real estate investment trust#Role in a portfolio|Real estate investment trust]].

'''Home equity''': Withdrawing home equity is sometimes described as a "loan of last resort", but it can be a resource for unexpected costs or reduced savings if you don't want to sell. Wade Pfau has said that "a standby line-of-credit through the FHA Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM) program can be accessed to meet spending goals as necessary, reducing the sequence of returns risk in retirement and preventing retirees from selling assets after a market decline. An early, unused HECM line of credit may lose equity through initial closing costs and annual FHA insurance premiums, however. See [[Reverse mortgages#Home equity loan|Home equity loan]], [[Reverse mortgages#Home equity line of credit|Home equity line of credit]], and [[Reverse mortgages]] in the Bogleheads&amp;reg; Wiki.

'''Rental property''': Andrew Tobias&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Tobias, ''The Only Investment Guide You'll Ever Need'', Mariner Books, January 5, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; and some Bogleheads&amp;reg; [https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=154119 Forum posters]&lt;ref&gt;{{forum post|t=154119|title=Rental Property Pros/Cons}}, December 29, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; remind us that rental properties are not just an investment but also a ''business'', and running a business is a ''job'', requiring time, interest, and ability. 

'''Gold and other precious metals''': [[William Bernstein]] recommends considering stock funds in companies that mine gold, silver, platinum and other precious metals. In spite of low returns, these funds have little correlation with other financial markets, do well during periods of high inflation, and benefit from rebalancing.&lt;ref&gt;William J. Bernstein, ''The Four Pillars of Investing'', McGraw-Hill, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike bullion, gold mining stocks pay shareholder dividends. The [[Lazy portfolios#Permanent Portfolio|Permanent Portfolio]] of Harry Browne contains equal shares of gold bullion, domestic stocks, short-term treasury bills, and long term treasury bonds. See also [[Gold|Gold]] and [[Precious metals equity]] in the Bogleheads&amp;reg; Wiki.

Instead of focusing only on investment diversification and allocations, manage retirement risk by combining those with hedging and insuring. See [[Matching strategy#Matching strategies for retirement planning|Matching strategies for retirement planning]] in the Bogleheads&amp;reg; Wiki.

==Inflation and retirement calculations==

Just as projected returns are used to predict future savings balances, projected inflation rates are used to predict future spending.

===Inflation factor===

An inflation factor can be used to convert between current or real dollars and future or nominal dollars after inflation. For example, 
&lt;ol&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; = P(1+i)&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; , where
&lt;ol&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; = inflated cost after n years,&lt;br&gt;
P = current cost,&lt;br&gt;
i = average annual inflation rate,&lt;br&gt;
n = years, and&lt;br&gt;

$100,000 in 10 years at 3% average annual inflation will require 

&lt;ol&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; = $100,000(1+0.03)&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; = $100,000(1.34) = $134,000 future dollars, where 1.34 is the inflation factor.&lt;/ol&gt;

Alternatively, for calculations of an annual expense over a range of years, the factor 1.03 can be applied to each previous year's value.

If indexes like the Consumer Price Indexes are used instead of an inflation rate, then a ratio of the index values for the appropriate two years can be used as the inflation factor.

===Retirement calculators===

There are 50 [[Retirement calculators and spending|retirement calculators]] listed in the Bogleheads&amp;reg; Wiki. Most of these calculators use an inflation rate to adjust future spending.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Some examples:&lt;br&gt;

* [http://www.cfiresim.com/input.php Crowdsourced FIRE Simulator] "'Inflation Adjusted': This increases your spending each year by the amount of inflation indicated in the Inflation Assumptions section on the sidebar. This means that your "spending power" remains the same throughout retirement. By default, Inflation Assumptions is set to use the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for its calculations, which is the generally accepted rule-of-thumb for inflation."&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
For calculators that use historical returns, such as [http://firecalc.com FIRECalc] or [http://www.retirementoptimizer.com/ Otar Retirement Calculator], both spending and returns are adjusted for inflation.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;From the websites:
* [http://firecalc.com FIRECalc 3.0] Producer Price Index (PPI), Consumer Price Index (CPI), or constant inflation rate are used to adjust spending and "historical data".
* [http://www.retirementoptimizer.com/ Otar Retirement Calculator] uses the actual market history, including growth rate and inflation: "The program uses the historic inflation for each year since 1900. Between 1900-1913, it uses the US Bureau of Labor Statistics wholesale price index. . . After 1913, it uses the Consumer Price Index. The program uses these for indexing the periodic withdrawals/deposits for each age and for each year starting with the current age and ending at the specified age of death."&lt;/ref&gt; The default inflated spending will maintain constant purchasing power, but there may be options to change spending as retirement progresses or portfolios decrease.

===Social Security Administration calculators===

All ''earnings'' are indexed to the national [https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/COLA/awifactors.html average wage index (AWI)]. Future earnings are indexed with [https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TRassum.html estimated] increases in the AWI. Earnings are indexed only to age 60 (two years prior to the first year of eligibility, 62); later earnings are used at face value. These increases are derived from the "Alternative II (intermediate)" assumptions in the [https://www.ssa.gov/oact/pubs.html OASDI Trustees Report].

Although Social Security documentation suggests that future ''benefits'' are increased with [https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TRassum.html estimated] cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs), the estimates from [https://secure.ssa.gov/RIL/SiView.do my Social Security], [http://www.ssa.gov/estimator/ Retirement Estimator], and the default [http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/anypia/anypia.html Detailed Calculator] (AnyPIA) do not project benefit increases beyond the current year. AnyPIA does offer the following increased benefit options: 
# Alternative I (optimistic) assumptions from the most recent OASDI Trustees Report. 
# Alternative II (intermediate) assumptions from the Trustees Report. 
# Alternative III (pessimistic) assumptions from the Trustees Report. 
# No benefit increases after the last known increase (default).
# User-specified benefit increase for each projected year.

Social Security recommends using the default of no benefit increases after the last known increase because it allows comparing a benefit estimate to current income and expenses. It does not help evaluate the whether current savings are sufficient.

===Consumer Price Indexes===

The [http://www.bls.gov/CPI/ Consumer Price Index (CPI)] program produces monthly data on changes in the prices paid by urban consumers for a representative basket of goods and services. There are separate indexes for various groups of consumers:

* The CPI for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) is the index most often reported by the national media.
* The CPI for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W) is the index most often used for wage adjustments.
* An experimental CPI for the Elderly (CPI-E) was created for Americans 62 and older, but is no longer published.
* The Chained CPI (C-CPI-U) is an alternative CPI-U begun in July 2002.

The CPI-E during its life behaved more like the CPI-U than the CPI-W.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth J. Stewart and Joseph Pavalone, [http://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.br12396.a06.htm "Attachment F: Experimental CPI for Americans 62 Years of Age and Older"], U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, December 3, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; The [http://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2012/ted_20120302_data.htm chart data] shows less than 5% difference between the CPI-E and CPI-U category percentages. From December 1982 through December 2011, the CPI-E rose at an annual rate of 3.1 percent, compared with increases of 2.9 percent for both the CPI-U and CPI-W. 

Older Americans faced slightly higher inflation from 1983 to 2011, due to their greater share of medical care and shelter. Medical care inflation was greater than most other goods and services (5.1% vs 2.8%), and shelter costs have modestly outpaced overall inflation. However, from 2006 to 2011 both the CPI-E and CPI-U rose at an annual rate of 2.3%, while the CPI-W increased 2.4%. This turnaround was caused by changes in the inflation rates of medical care and shelter: the gap between medical care inflation and overall inflation has generally fallen since 2005, and shelter inflation has been rising more slowly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2012/ted_20120302.htm "Consumer Price Index for the elderly"], Bureau of Labor Statistics, March 2, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The last published data for the CPI-E was in 2011.

The Chained Consumer Price Index (C-CPI-U) is a an alternative CPI-U. It assumes that inflation causes consumers to continuously choose less-expensive substitutes, reducing price increases by reducing the quality of goods and services consumed. The CPI-U also takes substitutions into account, but does it more slowly by a periodic adjustment of the representative basket. A proposal to apply the chained CPI to federal benefits such as Social Security to reduce the deficit has been controversial.&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Chained_Consumer_Price_Index "United States Chained Consumer Price Index"], ''Wikipedia'', retrieved August 2, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The BLS designed the C-CPI-U to be a closer approximation to a cost-of-living index than the other CPI measures, but has taken no position on which index Congress or the Administration should use to make adjustments to Social Security or any other federal program. The C-CPI-U is not used currently as an adjustment mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bls.gov/cpi/cpisupqa.htm Frequently Asked Questions about the Chained Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (C-CPI-U)], Bureau of Labor Statistics, retrieved August 4, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Producer Price Indexes===

The Producer Price Indexes (PPIs) are a family of indexes that measure changes in the selling prices received by domestic producers of goods and services. They formerly were referred to as Wholesale Price Indexes. When the PPIs are released, the news media will most often report the percentage change in the index for Finished Goods.

==Planning for inflation==

Knowing precisely how inflation will affect your spending in retirement may not be possible, but if you're close to retiring and know your expenses, you can estimate your own personal inflation rate as follows: 
# Start with an annual budget of expenses, using the [[Inflation and retirement spending#Key inflation areas|Key Areas]] above and your own categories. 
# Calculate each category as a percentage of your total expenses. 
# Choose an inflation rate for each category. 
# Multiply each category's percentage of total spending by the category inflation rate. For example, if 15% of your expenses are for medical care, which you estimate at 5% inflation, then 0.15 x 5%.
# Add the results for a weighted personal inflation rate in retirement.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Zoll, [http://news.morningstar.com/articlenet/article.aspx?id=567105 "Don't Discount Inflation When Planning for Retirement"], September 10, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text bytes="39880" sha1="1tmyedjhs3f5oy8ikj6rqm0gs7kshvk" xml:space="preserve">'''{{PAGENAME}}''' describes the impact medical spending could have on your retirement and how to incorporate it into your retirement planning.

==Overview==

No other area better illustrates how spending habits change as we grow older. In a 2009 — 2010 BLS survey, households with members age 62 and older reported spending 11.3% of annual income after taxes on healthcare, including insurance. The average for all households, including the elderly, was 6.9%. Medical costs outpaced overall inflation from 1983 — 2012 except for 1996 according to the BLS, and medical costs grew 5.1% annually in that time frame. &lt;ref&gt;Adam Zoll, [http://news.morningstar.com/articlenet/article.aspx?id=567105 "Don't Discount Inflation When Planning for Retirement"], September 10, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; 

From 2006 — 2011 both the experimental CPI-Elderly (62 years and older) and the CPI for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) rose at the same annual rate of 2.3%. This turnaround was caused by changes in medical care and shelter: the gap between medical care inflation and overall inflation has generally fallen since 2005, and shelter inflation has been rising more slowly. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2012/ted_20120302.htm "Consumer Price Index for the elderly"], Bureau of Labor Statistics, March 2, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 it was reported that “Average spending among people who are 64 years old is about 4.8 times as high as average spending among people who are 21 years old,” according to the Congressional Budget Office last year, citing research by actuaries. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/05/us/politics/health-care-law-obamacare-repeal-older-americans.html "Repeal of Health Law Hits a New Snag: Older Adults"], ''The New York Times'', March 6, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health Conditions==

Unlike employer insurance plans, Medicare plans cover only individuals, not couples or families. Chronic health conditions will increase doctor, hospital, and drug costs, and may make one combination of Medicare supplemental plans better than another.

The percentage among Medicare beneficiaries in 2010 of the 15 most common chronic conditions were:

|-
| style="width: 34%;"| 1. High blood pressure (58%) || style="width: 33%;"| 6. Heart failure (16%) || style="width: 33%;"| 11. Atrial fibrillation (8%)

|-
| 5. Diabetes (28%) || 10. Alzheimer's disease (11%) || 15. Stroke (4%)
|}

Over two-thirds of beneficiaries had two or more chronic conditions, and 14% had 6 or more. Beneficiaries with 4 or more chronic conditions had higher than average Medicare spending. Beneficiaries with 6 or more chronic conditions had over 3 times the average Medicare spending; these beneficiaries were more likely to have heart failure, chronic kidney disease, COPD, atrial fibrillation, and stroke. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cms.gov/research-statistics-data-and-systems/statistics-trends-and-reports/chronic-conditions/downloads/2012chartbook.pdf "Chronic Conditions among Medicare Beneficiaries, Chartbook"], Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Those 80 and older are more likely to have multiple chronic conditions and functional limitations, and this combination (compared to chronic conditions only) is associated with 
* increased emergency department visits and inpatient hospitalizations, and
* higher Medicare spending for inpatient hospital, skilled nursing facility, and home health services. &lt;ref&gt;Tricia Neuman, Juliette Cubanski, Jennifer Huang, and Anthony Damico, [http://kff.org/medicare/report/the-rising-cost-of-living-longer-analysis-of-medicare-spending-by-age-for-beneficiaries-in-traditional-medicare/ "The Rising Cost of Living Longer: Analysis of Medicare Spending by Age for Beneficiaries in Traditional Medicare"], Kaiser Family Foundation, January 14, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health Insurance==

If you paid off your mortgage before retirement, you probably changed from itemized to standard deduction on your tax returns. After retirement, paying for health insurance alone will move you back to itemized deductions. 

===Medicare===
{{See also|Medicare}}
Medicare Part A (Hospital) is paid by previous payroll deductions, and Medicare Part B (Doctor) premiums are standardized, but these plans only cover 80% of hospital and doctor costs. 

Medicare Part A and B is sometimes called original, traditional or fee-for-service Medicare to differentiate from Medicare Advantage health maintenance organization (HMO) or preferred provider organization (PPO) plans. Original Medicare is usually bundled with private supplemental (Medigap) and drug insurance plans (below) to provide similar benefits.

After your deductible is met, you typically pay 20% of the ''Medicare-approved amount'' for most doctor services (including most doctor services while you're a hospital inpatient), outpatient therapy, and ''durable medical equipment''.&lt;br /&gt;

''Medicare-approved amount'' is the amount a doctor or supplier that accepts Medicare assignment can be paid. It may be less than the actual amount a doctor or supplier charges. Medicare pays part of this amount and you're responsible for the difference.&lt;br /&gt;

''Durable medical equipment'' is certain medical equipment, like a walker, wheelchair, or hospital bed, ordered by your doctor for use in the home.

===Medicare health plans===

A Medicare health plan is offered by a private company that contracts with Medicare to provide Part A and B benefits to people with Medicare who enroll in the plan. The two most common are Medicare Advantage plans and Medicare Medical Savings Account (MSA) plans. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.medicare.gov/sign-up-change-plans/medicare-health-plans/medicare-health-plans.html "About Medicare health plans"], Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services, retrieved August 6, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Medicare Medical Savings Account====

Medicare Medical Savings Account (MSA) plans combine 
# A high-deductible health plan: The first part is a special type of high-deductible Medicare Advantage Plan (Part C). The plan will only begin to cover your costs once you meet a high yearly deductible, which varies by plan.
# A Medical Savings Account (MSA): The second part is a special type of savings account. The Medicare MSA Plan deposits money into your account. You can choose to use money from this savings account to pay your healthcare costs before you meet the deductible.

In addition to the Medicare services that all Medicare Advantage Plans must cover, some plans may cover extra benefits for an extra cost, like dental, vision, or long-term care not covered by Medicare. Medicare MSA Plans do not cover Medicare Part D prescription drugs; this would require a separate Prescription drug plan (Part D). &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.medicare.gov/sign-up-change-plans/medicare-health-plans/medicare-savings-accounts/medical-savings-account-plans.html "Medicare Medical Savings Account (MSA) Plans"], Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, retrieved August 6, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dental===
{{See also|Dental insurance}}

A common complaint on the Bogleheads&amp;reg; Forum is that dental and long-term care insurance insurance cover small expenses that many could self-insure, but not high expenses causing financial hardship. &lt;ref&gt;{{forum post|t=192958#p2935735|title=Re: Dental insurance, dental plans or pay as you go?}}, June 9, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; The consensus is that dental insurance is not worthwhile unless it is an employee benefit. Many dentists participate in dental discount plans, such as [http://coast2coastrx.com/index.php/more-benefits/discount-dental-plan Coast2Coast Rx Card].

===Long-term care insurance===
{{See also|Long-term care insurance|Matching strategy#Matching strategies for retirement planning|label 2=Matching strategies for retirement planning}}

You may need long-term care if you are unable to care for yourself due to physical illness, disability, or cognitive impairment, such as Alzheimer’s disease. You can receive long-term care at home or in a hospice, adult day care center, nursing home, or assisted living facility. 

Long-term care insurance can help protect your assets against the high cost of extended long-term care. However, a common complaint on the Bogleheads&amp;reg; Forum is that dental and long-term care insurance insurance cover small expenses that many could self-insure, but not high expenses causing financial hardship. &lt;ref&gt;{{forum post|t=192958#p2935735|title=Re: Dental insurance, dental plans or pay as you go?}}, June 9, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; If you don’t have long-term care insurance, you may have to pay down your assets until you qualify for Medicaid. Medicaid paid for 49% of Americans' long-term care in 2002 &lt;ref&gt;Christine Benz, [http://news.morningstar.com/articlenet/article.aspx?id=564139 40 Must-Know Statistics About Long-Term Care], ''Morningstar'', August 9, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;, and 40% in 2016. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2016/08/03/488385286/medicaid-safety-net-stretched-to-pay-for-seniors-long-term-care Medicaid Safety Net Stretched To Pay For Seniors' Long-Term Care], ''National Public Radio'', August 3, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, the average length of stay for nursing home residents was 2.4 years for all residents, and 8.9 months for discharged residents. &lt;ref&gt;Christine Benz, [http://news.morningstar.com/articlenet/article.aspx?id=564139 40 Must-Know Statistics About Long-Term Care], ''Morningstar'', August 9, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

To determine whether long-term care insurance is right for you, consider your personal risk factors:
* life expectancy,  
* gender,  
* family health history,  
* assets, and  
* available alternatives.

It also includes the comment that you should not purchase a policy if you can't afford the premiums.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newyorklife.com/newyorklife.com/General/FileLink/Static%20Files/NYL2/pdf/LTC_Shopper_Guide.pdf "A Shopper’s Guide to Long-Term Care Insurance"], National Association of Insurance Commissioners, 2013, page 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reviewing and changing Medicare plans==
&lt;br&gt;

{{ambox|text=The benefit of reviewing Medicare Advantage (Part C) and Prescription drug plans (Part D) annually with the [https://www.medicare.gov/find-a-plan/questions/home.aspx Medicare Plan Finder] cannot be emphasized enough. Plans change yearly, and what was once a bargain can become very expensive. The costs and coverages of plans available to you can be compared online, and changes made at no additional cost during the annual open enrollment period from October 15–December 7. A Part D Prescription drug plan change can result in a 37% savings with no change in coverage.}}


Changes between original Medicare (Part A and B) with a Medigap supplement, and Medicare Advantage (Part C), can also be made but require careful study in advance. For example, insurance companies can base Medigap approval and premium on pre-existing medical conditions after the initial enrollment period at 65.

==Life Expectancy Calculators==

===Social Security Administration===

If you are considering when to collect Social Security retirement benefits, one factor is how long you might live. The Social Security Administration's [https://www.ssa.gov/oact/population/longevity.html Life Expectancy Calculator] uses data compiled by the Social Security Administration. For example:

* A man reaching age 65 in 2016 can expect to live, on average, until age 84.2.
* A woman turning age 65 in 2016 can expect to live, on average, until age 86.6.

About one out of every four 65-year-olds in 2016 will live past age 90, and one out of 10 will live past age 95. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ssa.gov/planners/lifeexpectancy.html Calculators: Life Expectancy], Social Security Administration, retrieved August 7, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Planning Social Security benefits==

Under the rules of Social Security, your Primary Insurance Amount (PIA) is defined as the benefit you receive in the month of your Full Retirement Age (FRA).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/COLA/piaformula.html Primary Insurance Amount], from the Social Security Administration.&lt;/ref&gt; If you claim benefits earlier or later than your Full Retirement Age, the amount you will receive will be lower or higher than the Primary Insurance Amount.

Therefore, the amount of the benefit you receive is based on calculations determined by:

* Your Primary Insurance Amount at Full Retirement Age
* Claiming Social Security earlier or later than your Full Retirement Age
** Benefits will be lower if claimed earlier
** Benefits will be higher if claimed later

For each month that you begin before your FRA, you reduce your benefit by 5/9 of 1%. For example, if your FRA is 66, you reach this age on December 9, and you elect to begin your benefit on June 9, the reduction to your benefit would be 6 × 5/9 × 1% = 3.33%. This monthly reduction rate occurs for the first 36 months that you begin prior to your FRA. After 36 months, it is 5/12 of 1% per month. The only other factors that would change the 5/9 of 1% reduction would be if the individual has earned income in the previous year, as the PIA will not include this, and the annual inflation adjuster for the new year.  

If you delay starting your retirement or old-age benefit past FRA, you earn Delayed Retirement Credits and get a larger benefit.  Wife, husband, widow, and widower benefits are also reduced if started before FRA (using different formulas), but are not increased by waiting past FRA to start.

{{Notice| The Social Security Administration has an illustrative table which shows the effects of early or late retirement. See: [{{{url|http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/ProgData/ar_drc.html}}} Early or delayed retirement].

For example, you were born in 1951. If you decided to retire at 66 (your full retirement age), you would get 100% of your retirement benefits.

If you decided to retire early at 63, you would get 80% of your benefits.

Delaying retirement beyond the age of 66 will increase your benefit by 8% of your Primary Insurance Amount / year. Waiting one year (until 67), results in receiving a benefit of 108%, which is 8% more than if you had taken retirement at 66. Waiting until 68 results in a benefit of 116%, which is 7.4% more than if you had started at 67.}}

Social Security is unisex and roughly actuarially fair. If you are a single unisex person of average health, it doesn't matter when you take it. There is a rough trade-off between fewer dollars for more years (start early) and more dollars for fewer years (start late). 

Since females outlive males on average, single males will live fewer years than a unisex person and should take it earlier; single females will live more years than a unisex person and should take it later. 

Since widows and widowers get the greater of their own benefit and their deceased spouse's benefit,&lt;ref group="note"&gt;A surviving spouse or child may receive a special lump-sum death payment of $255 if they meet certain requirements. Apply within two years of the date of death. See: [http://www.ssa.gov/survivorplan/ifyou7.htm Survivors Planner: A Special Lump-Sum Death Payment]&lt;/ref&gt; married couples have to consider their joint life. A high earning male with a low earning wife should wait to collect the higher benefit, not because he will live long enough to make up for what he gives up by not starting early, but because his wife will. 

All benefits are subject to the earnings test if you are under Full Retirement Age.  Your benefits will be reduced depending on your earnings for the year.  Your wife (husband) may also have her wife (his husband) benefits that are based on your work record reduced by your earnings.  The earnings test does not apply once you reach Full Retirement Age.

Here is a concrete question from the forums that shows the potential complexity of Social Security planning, which may not be fully applicable anymore to those who turn 62 after Jan 2, 2016 due to the new deemed filing rules: 

{{quotation|
Wife and I are same age, 62 this summer. Her SS that she qualifies for on her own is about half mine. The wrinkle is she still is working. Her 35 highest years have a lot of zeros, so each year she works will replace a zero. I am retired and when I turn 62 my pension drops by more than half, called a level income option because it assume SS will be started at 62. We need to make up some of the income lost by the drop in pension. Wife contributes 1000 per month to her 401(k) so we can stop that. Having her file for SS as the link suggests might be an option but she plans to work to age 66. Her salary is very modest but her job provides us health benefits. Do you think this "Team Play" technique would work for us or does it assume both spouses are not working?}}

The full answer: 

{{quotation|
The Team Play described assumes neither is working at 62, and turned 62 before January 2, 2016. There are several issues for you to consider. 

Her own benefits: 
If your wife is going to continue to work for the health benefits, then it doesn't make sense for her to apply for her own benefits before age 66 if she makes much more than $20,000. The earnings limit for 2009 is $14,160 - for every $2 over the limit, $1 is withheld from benefits. If her benefit at age 62 would be $800 a month ($9,600 a year), she would get to keep none of her social security if she makes $33,360 ($19,200 over the limit - benefits reduced by $9,600). 

Spousal benefits: 
When you reach 66, you can either file or file and suspend (''File and suspend is not of benefit under the new tax law''). Your wife can then apply for wife's benefits on your record. At 66, she will get half of your PIA (age 66 benefit) if her own PIA is a lesser amount. If your PIA is $1,800 a month and hers is $800, she can get $900 as a wife. If hers is $1,000, she won't get a wife's benefit, but she will get her own $1,000 (this assumes that she starts benefits at 66 - it is possible for her to delay her own benefits while collecting spousal benefits). Since she is still working and replacing some of those zero years, she may well end up with a PIA greater than 1/2 of yours (in spite of your statement that her benefit is about 1/2 of yours, that may not be true after her additional earnings are included in her calculation). You however, could follow part of the team play plan. When your wife applies for her own benefits at age 66, you can apply for your husband's benefit while delaying your own benefit. If her benefit is $800, you could get $400 at age 66 as her husband. By not taking your $1,800 at 66, you will increase the amount you eventually get at 70 (assuming you delay the maximum).}}

==Some basic rules about eligibility==
*If you apply for your own benefit before your Full Retirement Age and you are eligible for a spousal benefit at that time, you are presumed or deemed to have applied for a wife or husband's benefit at the same time.&lt;ref group="note" name="ObliviousInvestor"&gt;Exception: If you are younger than 62 as of 1 Jan 2016, deemed filing can occur beyond full retirement age as well. Specifically, if you apply for retirement benefits at any time and you are also eligible at that time for a spousal benefit, you will be deemed to have filed for your spousal benefit as well. In addition, if you are entitled to your retirement benefit at any time and you later become eligible for a spousal benefit, you will be deemed to have filed for your spousal benefit when you become eligible. (Ref: [https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=2700523#p2700523 Re: Changes to Social Security], [[Mike Piper]], Nov 27, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;
*If you apply for a wife or husband's benefit before your Full Retirement Age and you are eligible for a spousal benefit at that time, you are presumed or deemed to have applied for your own benefit at the same time.&lt;ref group="note" name="ObliviousInvestor" /&gt;
*You are ''entitled'' to a benefit if you are ''eligible'' and apply.
*You can suspend your old-age (retirement) benefit and earn Delayed Retirement Credits if you are Full Retirement Age.
*If you suspend your old-age benefit, you remain entitled to it even if no payments are made.
*You are eligible for a wife or husband's benefit if your spouse is entitled to old-age or disability benefits and&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Exception: If your spouse has suspended his/her retirement benefit, and the suspension request was made after 29 Apr 2016, you will not be eligible for a spousal benefit during the period of suspension. (Ref: [https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=2700121#p2700121 Re: Changes to Social Security], [[Mike Piper]], Nov 26, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;
#You have been married for a year (or other special cases),
#You are 62 or have in care a child under 16 receiving child's benefits (or a qualifying disabled adult child receiving [[Planning for disabled adult children#Social Security Disability Income - Disabled Adult Child (SSDI-DAC)|SSDI-DAC benefits)]] based on your spouse's record,
#You are not entitled to an old-age or disability benefit based on a primary insurance amount that is equal to 1/2 or more of your spouse's.
*You can withdraw your application within 12 months of your original entitlement:
#You must pay back all benefits receive by you or your family that depend on the application.
#You must get the consent of anyone receiving benefits based on the application; for example, your spouse.
#You can only withdraw one application in your lifetime.

==Some additional notes and examples on spouse benefit==
(''Additional strategies to increase benefits may be available for those who turned 62 before Jan 2, 2016'')
*Self benefits are those benefits based on your own work record.
*Spouse benefits are those benefits based on your spouse’s work record.
*Self and spouse benefits are separate and the calculations are applied to each separately.
*Your available benefit is the combination of your own benefit and your spouse benefit.
*The benefit calculations are based on the PIA (Primary Insurance Amount), FRA (Full Retirement Age) and the number of months before or after FRA that self and spouse begin receiving benefits.
*Any benefit increase or decrease (in percentage terms) due to taking, or deemed to be taking, a self or spouse benefit earlier or later than FRA, is permanent.
*A spouse benefit is only available if one spouse’s PIA is less than half of the other spouse’s PIA. The spouse benefit (SB) is the difference between half of the higher earning spouse’s PIA (PIA1) and the lower earning spouse’s PIA (PIA2), that is SB = Max(0, PIA1 / 2 &amp;minus; PIA2)
*You cannot take your own benefit or your spouse benefit before age 62.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;An exception is the spousal child in care benefit, for a child or a disabled adult child, in which the spouse may receive spousal child in care benefits prior to 62 years old.

[https://www.ssa.gov/oact/quickcalc/spouse.html Social Security - Benefits for Spouses]

&lt;/ref&gt;
*You cannot take your spouse benefit unless your spouse is taking their own benefit.
*You are deemed to have taken your spouse benefit if you and your spouse are taking your own benefits, even if you have not formally applied for the spouse benefit and are not, in fact, even receiving the spouse benefit. 
*If you are taking a spouse benefit, you are deemed to be taking your own benefit. 
*If you take, or are deemed to take, your own benefit at your FRA, you will receive an amount equal to your PIA. 
*If you take, or are deemed to take, your own benefit before your FRA, your benefit is reduced by 5/9% per month for each of the first 36 months and 5/12% per month for each month beyond 36 months that you choose to receive your benefit before FRA.
*If you take, or are deemed to take, your own benefit after your FRA, your benefit is increased by 2/3% per month for each month after FRA that you choose to receive your benefit, up to, but not including, age 70.
*If you take, or are deemed to take, your spouse benefit at your FRA, you will receive your full spouse benefit.
*If you take, or are deemed to take, your spouse benefit before your FRA, your spouse benefit is reduced by 25/36% per month for each of the first 36 months and 5/12% per month for each month beyond 36 months that you choose to receive your spouse benefit before FRA.
*If you take your spouse benefit after your FRA, there is no change to the benefit.

===Examples===
'''Situation'''
*Husband's PIA: $3,000
*Wife's PIA: $1,000
*Wife's FRA: 67
*Husband’s FRA: 67 (note that the wife’s spouse benefit does not depend on when the husband takes his benefit in relation to his FRA, but does in relation to her FRA)

Wife’s full spouse benefit is ($3,000 / 2 &amp;minus; $1,000) = $500

'''Case 1''' (wife takes at 62, husband already taking)
Her own reduced benefit is:
*5/9% &amp;times; 36 = 20%
*5/12% &amp;times; 24 = 10%
*Total early claim deduction for her own benefit = 30%
*(100 &amp;minus; 30)% &amp;times; $1,000 = $700

Her reduced spouse benefit is:
*25/36% &amp;times; 36 = 25%
*5/12% &amp;times; 24 = 10%
*Total early claim deduction for spousal benefit = 35%
*(100 &amp;minus; 35)% &amp;times; $500 = $325

Her combined total benefit, starting at age 62 = $700 + $325 = $1,025

'''Case 2''' (wife takes at 62, husband starts taking when wife is 67 (FRA))
*Wife will get her own reduced benefit of $700 between ages 62 and 67.
*Wife will get full spouse benefit of $500 at age 67.

Her combined total benefit, starting at age 67 = $700 + $500 = $1,200

'''Case 3''' (wife takes at 67, husband already taking)
*Wife will get her own full benefit of $1,000
*Wife will get full spouse benefit of $500

Her combined total benefit = $1,000 + $500 = $1,500

==Some computational and payment details==
The following details are taken from the SSA [https://secure.ssa.gov/apps10/poms.nsf/partlist Program Operations Manual System]:
*Benefits are rounded down to the nearest dollar.
*All reductions and credits are computed using fractions, not percents.  Someone who starts a retirement benefit 6 months early will have a reduction of 6 &amp;times; 5/9% or 30/900 = 1/30.  For a PIA of $1,723.40, the benefit would be 1723.4 &amp;times; 29/30 = 1665.95 rounded down to the nearest whole dollar or $1,665.  Using a reduction of 3.33% would give an answer of 1723.4 &amp;times; 96.67% = 1666.01, which would seem to yield a benefit of $1,666 a month. This is incorrect.
*The COLA is computed in percents to one decimal place, for example, the 2009 COLA was 5.8%.  The COLA is applied to your PIA, not your benefit.
*When the PIA is computed, it is rounded down to the nearest $0.10.  For example, when a COLA of 5.8% is applied to a PIA of $1,723.40, the new PIA is 1723.4 &amp;times; 1.058 = 1823.36 rounded down to 1823.30.  With a reduction of 1/30 for starting a retirement benefit 6 months early, the new benefit will be 1823.3 &amp;times; 29/30 = 1762.52 rounded down to $1,762.  The actual increase in the retirement benefit is (1762 &amp;minus; 1665) / 1665 = 5.826%.  With another PIA, the benefit could go up slightly less than 5.8%.
*If you delay retirement past your full retirement age, the delayed credits are applied in January of the following year or in the month of attainment of age 70 if applicable.  For example, if your full retirement age is 66 and you apply for retirement benefits on your birthday in March at age 68, your initial benefit will include 22 months of delayed credits.  The additional 2 months of delayed credits for January and February will be applied the following January and affect monthly payments thereafter, but you will not receive any lump sum to make up for the amounts "missing" from the payments in that first calendar year.  Filing for your benefit to begin in January (received in Feb) means that no months are "missed," and filing for your benefit to begin in July is worst in terms of the number of months missed.  See the first link in the [[#Forum discussions|Forum discussions]] section for details.
*Benefits are paid in the month following the month earned.  In a year with a COLA, the COLA is used to compute the December benefit paid in January.  Thus the 2009 COLA, while based on the increase in CPI-W from the third quarter of 2007 to the third quarter of 2008 and applied to the December 2008 benefit, is referred to as the 2009 COLA since it first showed up in the January 2009 benefit payment. 

==Taxation==
[https://www.ssa.gov/oact/cola/cbb.html Contribution and Benefit Bases] lists historical values for annual maximum wages on which Social Security ''taxes'' are levied. For 2025, the wage maximum is $176,100, and for 2026, it is $184,500.

[http://www.irs.gov/publications/p915/index.html IRS Publication 915, Social Security and Equivalent Railroad Retirement Benefits] is the IRS version of taxing Social Security ''benefits''. 

[[Taxation of Social Security benefits]] discusses several examples of SS benefit taxation.

==Social Security application==
Although Social Security generally says you can submit your application up to 3 months before you want to begin benefits, you may request benefits to start the month of filing, a month in the past (see retroactive benefits below), or up to 4 months in the future. This request is called the "Month of Election". Benefits ''start'' the "Month of Entitlement", defined as the month in which an individual has filed an application and Social Security has confirmed that age and earnings requirements have been met.&lt;ref&gt;[https://secure.ssa.gov/poms.nsf/lnx/0200204040 GN 00204.040 Month of Election (MOEL) and Month of Entitlement (MOET)], Program Operations Manual System (POMS), retrieved July 21, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Benefits are then ''paid'' the following month, [https://faq.ssa.gov/ics/support/kbanswer.asp?QuestionID=3745 based on your birth date] for applications since 1997. If your benefits start in April, you will receive your first benefit payment in May.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ssa.gov/planners/retire/applying8.html Social Security Retirement Planner: How You Apply For Retirement Benefits Or Medicare], retrieved July 21, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Applications may be [https://secure.ssa.gov/iClaim/rib online] (recommended by the Social Security Administration&lt;ref&gt;Social Security Administration, [https://faq.ssa.gov/link/portal/34011/34019/Article/3734/How-do-I-apply-for-Social-Security-retirement-benefits "How do I apply for Social Security retirement benefits?"], ''Frequently Asked Questions'', retrieved July 24, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;), by phone (1-800-772-1213 or TTY 1-800-325-0778), or in person at your [https://secure.ssa.gov/ICON/main.jsp local Social Security office]. 

The following sections on Retroactive payments and restricted applications, Deemed filing, and Voluntary suspension are based on the many Forum contributions of [[Mike Piper]], Oblivious Investor.

===Retroactive payments===
For Social Security retirement applications filed after full retirement age (FRA), a retroactive lump sum benefit back to FRA or a maximum of six months is available.&lt;ref&gt;[https://secure.ssa.gov/poms.nsf/lnx/0200204030 GN 00204.030 Retroactivity for Title II Benefits], Program Operations Manual System (POMS), retrieved July 21, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

[https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=168328#p2533613 Forum threads] have discussed the possibility of an unwanted lump sum and reduced monthly benefits from Social Security's use of a retroactive entitlement date after FRA. To make sure that you receive all the delayed retirement credits you expect, your application should restrict its scope with "unequivocal" statements to make your intentions clear:

{{quotation|
'''GN 00204.020 Scope of the Application'''&lt;ref&gt;[https://secure.ssa.gov/poms.nsf/lnx/0200204020 GN 00204.020 Scope of the Application], Program Operations Manual System (POMS), retrieved July 21, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

. . . A claimant may choose to limit or restrict the scope of the application to exclude a class of benefits he or she may be eligible to on one or more SSNs for any reason (except where deemed filing applies). The reason may be to receive higher current benefits or to maximize the amount of benefits over a period of time, including the effect of delayed retirement credits (DRCs). (See RS 00615.480 for information on adjustment of the reduction factor.)

'''a. Before adjudication'''

The claimant must restrict the application before it is adjudicated.

'''b. Unequivocal statements'''

The claimant may restrict the application by completing appropriate blocks on the application or by signing an unequivocal statement that he or she does not wish to file for a specific benefit as follows:&lt;br&gt;
“I filed on (DATE) for all benefits for which I may be eligible except ___________”; or&lt;br&gt;
“I wish to exclude ________ benefits from the scope of this application.”&lt;br&gt;
Only unequivocal statements are acceptable. Qualifying phrases such as “at this time” or he or she plans to file in the future are not acceptable. . .}}

Sample statements to include in the application comments section would be:
{{blockquote|"I wish to receive my maximum benefit, including all delayed retirement credits to age 70. I do not wish to receive any retroactive payments based on a retirement age earlier than 70."}}

===Deemed filing===

As of April 30, 2016 the deemed filing rules apply to all applications, even if you have reached full retirement age. If you file for retirement benefits or spouse's benefits and you are also eligible for any other benefits at that time, you will be deemed to have filed for all benefits. This prevents using a restricted application to claim benefits on another's earnings record (for example, a spouse), while not claiming on your own earnings record. However, the new deemed filing rule, extending it to FRA and beyond, does not apply to those born before January 2, 1954.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ssa.gov/planners/retire/deemedfaq.html Deemed Filing For Retirement And Spouse’s Benefits FAQ's], retrieved February 9, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, deemed filing now applies automatically for anyone already receiving benefits when they become eligible for another benefit. Before April 30, 2016 deemed filing applied only when a new application was submitted.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=176706#p2672395 Changes to Social Security], Bogleheads Forum, retrieved July 21, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Voluntary suspension===

If you are already receiving Retirement Insurance Benefits (RIB) and have reached full retirement age, you can voluntarily suspend them to increase your payments with delayed retirement credits (DRCs). If you change your mind and want the payments to start before age 70, tell Social Security when you want your benefits reinstated (orally or in writing). Your request may include benefits for any months when your payments were suspended, but you will lose DRCs for any retroactive payments. Suspended payments will start automatically the month you reach age 70.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ssa.gov/planners/retire/suspend.html Retirement Planner: Suspending Retirement Benefit Payments], retrieved July 21, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|
'''GN 02409.130 Voluntary Suspension Reinstatement'''&lt;ref&gt;[https://secure.ssa.gov/apps10/poms.nsf/lnx/0202409130 GN 02409.130 Voluntary Suspension Reinstatement], Program Operations Manual System (POMS), retrieved July 21, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''A. Procedure for reinstatement at age 70'''

The Program Service Centers (PSC) use automated systems to process voluntary delayed retirement credit (VOLDRC) reinstatements at age 70. When we reinstate benefits at age 70, all VOLDRCs are credited immediately. We automatically select and process reinstatements to stop suspension with the month before the month the retirement insurance benefit (RIB) beneficiary attains age 70. For an explanation of the PSCs’ automated processes for voluntary suspension reinstatements, see SM 03020.250.

'''B. Procedure for reinstatement prior to age 70'''

The RIB beneficiary who requested suspension may at any time request benefit reinstatement as of any month in the suspension period. We will accept a written or oral request. There is no signature requirement.}}

As of April 30, 2016 the following changes apply while your benefits are suspended:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=176706#p2672395 Changes to Social Security], Bogleheads Forum, retrieved July 21, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;
# you cannot receive a benefit based on another’s earnings record, and 
# no one can receive a benefit based on your earnings record. 
These changes, along with the Deemed filing changes above, eliminated the “file and suspend” strategy allowing a spouse to collect spouse's benefits while continuing to earn DRCs on their own earnings record.

Since the passage of the 1983 Amendments to the Social Security Act&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ssa.gov/history/1983amend.html|title=SUMMARY of P.L. 98-21, (H.R. 1900) Social Security Amendments of 1983-Signed on April 20, 1983|website=Social Security|accessdate=31 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social Security benefits are subject to taxation.  

The amount of [[Social Security]] income which is taxable depends on your Social Security income and your other income.  Most high-income retirees will have 85% of Social Security benefits taxable.  For lower-income retirees, less than 85% will be taxable, but many retirees in a 12% tax bracket will face a [[marginal tax rate]] much higher than 12%. Social security benefits are also taxable in some states (see Figure 1).

For social security taxes imposed on earned wages, see the [[Payroll tax]] article.

==The formula==
{{See also|Tax analysis#Derivation of tax rate boundaries for Social Security taxation| label 1=Derivation of tax rate boundaries for Social Security taxation}}

The full rules are in IRS Publication 915.&lt;ref name="pub915"&gt;[https://www.irs.gov/publications/p915 IRS Publication 915]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Calculation of taxable benefits is done in two steps. First, ''Worksheet A'' is used to determine if your benefits are taxable. If so, ''Worksheet 1 through 4'' (select one based on filing method) is used to calculate the tax.&lt;/ref&gt; This simplification covers most cases; there are special rules if you contribute to a [[Traditional IRA]], receive retroactive payments for prior years, or file forms to exempt other income from taxation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bogleheads%27 Guide to Retirement Planning]], Chapter 11; this is the main reference for the formulas above, as it is much easier to follow than the IRS guide.&lt;/ref&gt;

The relevant income for Social Security taxation includes all items which are normally part of your adjusted gross income, plus tax-exempt interest income, plus 50% of your Social Security benefits. (Historically, the 50% represents the fact that half of your Social Security contributions were made by your employer and thus not taxed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p915.pdf IRS Publication 915, Social Security and Equivalent Railroad Retirement Benefits]&lt;/ref&gt;)

There are two relevant base amounts; unlike most income limits in the tax code, they are not adjusted for inflation.  The lower base is $25,000 if you are single, $32,000 if married filing jointly.  The upper base is $34,000 if you are single, $44,000 if married filing jointly.&lt;ref name="pub915" /&gt;

If your relevant income is below the lower base, none of your benefits are taxable.  For every $1 of relevant income between the lower and upper bases, 50 cents of your Social Security benefits become taxable, up to 50% of your total benefits.  For every $1 of relevant income above the upper bases, 85 cents of your Social Security benefits become taxable, up to a total taxable amount of 85% of your benefits.&lt;ref name="pub915" /&gt;

==Examples==
{{Notice|See: [[Tools_and_calculators#Personal_finance_toolbox |Personal finance toolbox]] - the tool used to generate charts below - for your own situation.}}
The examples below are based on tax numbers for 2025.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Tax bracket is based on Taxable income from {{Cite web| title=IRS releases tax inflation adjustments for tax year 2026, including amendments from the One, Big, Beautiful Bill|url=https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-releases-tax-inflation-adjustments-for-tax-year-2026-including-amendments-from-the-one-big-beautiful-bill|access-date=November 27, 2025|website=Internal Revenue Service}}&lt;/ref&gt; They illustrate how tax brackets and Social Security taxation interact, creating a 22.2% marginal tax rate for most taxpayers in the 12% tax bracket, and a 40.7% marginal tax rate (or slightly higher in the phase-out of the senior deduction) for
* Single taxpayers 65 and older with SS benefits above $33,959; at that SS, the marginal tax rate begins at ordinary income of $45,685;
* Married taxpayers 65 and older with SS benefits above $82,488; at that SS, the marginal tax rate begins at ordinary income above $78,185.

===Single taxpayers===

If you are single and receive $36,000 in Social Security benefits:
*None of your benefits are taxable if your other income is less than $7,000.
*For every dollar between $7,000 and $16,000, an additional 50 cents becomes taxable (although the tax is zero in this whole range; taxpayers with lower benefits may owe tax) 
*For every dollar over $19,000, an additional 85 cents becomes taxable, up to a total other income of $46,706, which makes the maximum $30,600 taxable.  

The table below assumes that you take the 2026 standard deduction ($24,150 for a taxpayer over 65, phases out by 6% of adjusted gross income over $75,000 to create an effective 23.32% tax bracket)

===Married taxpayers===

If you are a married couple, receive $72,000 in Social Security benefits and no other income except as described below:
*You are already in the 50% phase-in and $2000 of your benefits are taxable even with no other income (but the tax is zero)
*For every dollar up to $8,000, an additional 50 cents becomes taxable.  
*For every dollar over $8,000, an additional 85 cents becomes taxable, up to a total other income of $72,941, which makes the maximum $61,200 taxable. 

The table below assumes that you take the 2026 standard deduction ($47,500 for a married couple over 65, phases out by 12% of adjusted gross income over $150,000 to create an effective 24.44% bracket but it is not reached in this example)

[[File:SS Married Tax.png]]&lt;br /&gt;

With very high benefits and qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, it is possible to have an even higher marginal tax rate.  Here is an example of a married couple with $90,000 in Social Security and $20,000 in qualified dividends.  The qualified dividends are not taxed until their taxable income reaches $98,900.  But when that happens, each dollar of taxable income increases tax by 27 cents, as it is taxed at 12% and causes a dollar of qualified dividends to be taxed at 15% rather than 0%.  This creates a marginal tax rate of 49.95%, increasing to 54.83% when they also hit the phase-out of the senior deduction, then decreasing back to 29.64% once the maximum 85% of Social security is taxed.

In graphical form,&lt;ref name="MrMoney"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; assuming the OI comes from taxable IRA withdrawals/conversions, and starting the marginal rate calculations at $0 withdrawn/converted:&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:SS Married marginal rates chart1.png|alt=]]&lt;br /&gt;

If you have already made a $48.7K taxable IRA withdrawal (converted to Roth or not) and are considering a larger amount for the year, the marginal rates for amounts between $48.7K and $70K are shown here:

[[File:SS Married marginal rates chart2.png]]

There is no 40.7% rate in either of the above situations because the example couple reaches the maximum taxable SS benefit amount well before reaching the 22% tax bracket.

==Heat map representation==

Plotting marginal tax rates as a function of Social Security income (horizontal axis) and non-Social Security income (vertical access) gives the following "heat map" style plots.

[[File:SSHeatMapSingle2023.png|thumb|right|Marginal Tax Rate vs. Social Security and non-Social Security Income, 2025 Single Filers]]

[[File:SSHeatMapMFJ2023.png|thumb|right|Marginal Tax Rate vs. Social Security and non-Social Security Income, 2025 Married Joint Filers]]

The central point on each plot above which 40.7% marginal rates become possible can be calculated directly the formulas that describe taxation of Social Security, described above. As of 2026, these values are:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Filing Status !! 22% Threshold !! Standard Deduction !! Social Security !! Other Income
|-
| Single || $50,400 || $24,150 || $33,959 || $45,685
|-
| Married Joint || $100,800|| $47,500 || $82,488 || $78,185
|}

Taxpayers earning less Social Security income than these values are possibly affected by the 22.2% bump. As a function of annual Social Security benefit (SS), the 22.2% bump begins and ends at the following levels of income from other sources:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Filing Status !! 22.2% Bump Begins !! 22.2% Bump Ends
|-
| Single || $34,000 - 0.5 * SS || $28,706 + 0.5 * SS
|-
| Married Joint || $56,054 - 0.2297 * SS || $36,941 + 0.5 * SS
|}

Taxpayers earning more Social Security income than the above values are possibly affected by the 40.7% bump. As a function of annual Social Security benefit (SS), the 40.7% bump begins and ends at the following levels of income from other sources:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Filing Status !! 40.7% Bump Begins !! 40.7% Bump Ends
|-
| Single || $53,486 - 0.2297 * SS || $28,706 + 0.5 * SS
|-

===Examples===

A single taxpayer receiving $36,000 of Social Security benefits would be possibly affected by the 40.7% bump because the amount is more than $33,959. The 40.7% bump begins at '''$45,217''' ($53,486 - 0.2297 * $36,000) and ends at '''$46,706''' ($28,706 + 0.5 * $360,000). These values agree with the above charts except for a $1 rounding difference.

Married taxpayers receiving $72,000 of Social Security benefits would be possibly affected by the 22.2% bump, but not the 40.7% bump, because the amount is less than $82,488. The 22.2% bump begins at '''$39,516''' ($56,054 - 0.2297 * $72,000) and ends at '''$72,941''' ($36,941 + 0.5 * $72,000). These values also agree with the above charts except for a $2 rounding difference.

==State taxation==
[[File:State ssc tax large.png|thumb|right|300px|Figure 1.]]
While most states do not tax social security benefits (as of 2021, shaded blue in figure; along with gray shaded states which do not impose income tax; Missouri, Nebraska,&lt;ref&gt;[https://governor.nebraska.gov/press/governor-pillen-signs-historic-tax-cuts-package Governor Pillen Signs Historic Tax Cuts Package]&lt;/ref&gt; North Dakota,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.tax.nd.gov/news/tax-legislative-changes/updates-office-state-tax-commissioner-newsletters/income-tax-update Income Tax Update - Special Session 2021]&lt;/ref&gt; and West Virginia have eliminated the tax since this figure), eleven states (shaded pink or light blue) do tax them.

These states that tax benefits to the extent they are taxed at the federal level:&lt;ref name="taxesbystate"&gt; [https://www.retirementliving.com/taxes-by-state Retirementliving.com taxes by state]&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Minnesota'''
*'''Rhode Island'''

These states tax Social Security normally, but exempt all qualifying retirement income, including both Social Security and pensions, for retirees at a lower income level:&lt;ref name="taxesbystate" /&gt;
*'''Colorado'''
*'''Montana'''
*'''Utah'''

These states tax Social Security benefits only partially, or only at certain income levels:&lt;ref name="taxesbystate" /&gt;
*'''Connecticut''': Allows taxpayers to totally exempt Social Security from state income tax if income is less than $75,000 single, $100,000 married; above that, only 25% of federally taxed Social Security is taxed in CT.
*'''Kansas''': Exempts Social Security benefits from state taxation if federal adjusted income is less than $75,000.
*'''New Mexico''' : Benefits are exempt for a taxpayer 65 years of age or older, with income up to $100,000 single, $150,000 married filing jointly.
*'''Vermont''': Social Security is taxed only for income above $45,000 single, $60,000 married.

==Overview==
This tax impact calculator works on the principle of the old cliché: a picture is worth a thousand words!

[[Image:IntroDiff.jpg|right]]This is an illustration of exactly what this article is all about.  The blue line illustrate the taxes paid when all of your income comes from ordinary sources.  The red line illustrates the taxes paid on the same income stream where $30,000 comes from Social Security, $6,000 comes from Long Term Capital Gains, and the rest from ordinary income sources.  The dotted green line is the purpose of this article.  It illustrates your tax savings and how, during retirement, those savings can grow in this case up to $4,642, then shrink back to only $1,725 as you give $2,917 back to the IRS as your initially tax free LTCG and Social Security slowly becomes taxable income.  If you know that you will have to give back the tax savings and when that will happen, maybe you can modify your investments and keep the savings.
	 
The interesting thing here is that your broker can’t talk to you about taxes and your tax accountant can’t talk to you about investments.  Neither one will show you this picture, it had to come from a computer geek on the Internet.  On top of all that, the computer geek is not “qualified” to give advice on either topic, but you can download the spreadsheet, enter your personal financial data and create the graph of your own personal “Marginal” tax rates then show that graph to your accountant and broker as a reference on the type of advice you need.  They are allowed to verify if the graph looks reasonable, they just can’t create it for you.

{{clear}}

==Marginal tax rates==
Your [[marginal tax rate]] is “The amount of tax paid on an additional dollar of income.”

Prior to retirement we are all familiar with the 10%, 15%, 25%, etc. tax rates that created the blue line in the first graph.

[[Image:MarginalRates.jpg|left]]We initially receive our Social Security and Long Term Capital Gains as tax free income and this is what pushed the initial taxation point of the red line well past the blue line.  The problem is that these income sources are not actually tax free, their taxation is merely delayed until your gross income sources reach higher levels and inflation is causing retirees to reach those higher levels earlier each year.

Once you start paying these delayed taxes, you pay them in parallel to your standard income tax rates which is what creates the higher marginal income tax rates.

The dotted green line in this second graph represents the 50% and 85% “taxability” levels of your Social Security benefits as defined by the 1983 and 1993 amendments to the original Social Security Act.  At the 50% level each dollar of additional income increases your taxable income by $1.50 and the 85% level increases your taxable income by $1.85.  This explains why most of the solid red marginal tax rate line is 50% higher then 85% higher than the dotted red standard IRS tax brackets.  The 55.5% Marginal Rate is created by the combination of the delayed taxation of your Long Term Gains, the dotted blue line, compounded by the 85% taxability of your Social Security benefits, you are basically paying parallel taxes on your parallel taxes.  The shape of the 55.5% and 46.25% Marginal Tax Brackets in this chart is why the spreadsheet is called The Hump.
{{clear}}
[[Image:ParallelTaxes.jpg|right]]Let’s look at these parallel taxes from a spreadsheet point of view.  

In the Green taxation lane you pay your normal federal tax rates on the additional income that you receive.  

In the Gold lane you first get your Social Security benefits as tax free income, then the 1983 and 1993 amendments to the Social Security act kick in so the additional income also makes a portion of your previously tax free Social Security benefit taxable and you pay your normal federal tax rates on the now taxable portion of your benefit in parallel to the taxes paid on the actual income you received.

In the Purple lane, as with your Social Security benefits, you initially get your Long Term Gains tax free, then as you approach the top of your 15% bracket the combined amount of your actual income plus the taxable Social Security pushes a portion of your long term gains into the 25% bracket where they are then taxed at a reduced rate of 15%.

The ratio between the actual total income and the total taxes paid in all three parallel tax lanes is what creates your Marginal Tax Rates.

{{clear}}

==Setup==

The spreadsheet is already set up for the 2015 tax tables, personal exemptions and standard deductions. The yellow background numbers from the [setup] tab will automatically be transferred to each spreadsheet page to perform the various calculations necessary to create the graphs. 

In other tax years you need to update the tax tables from the appropriate IRS sources.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;See: [http://www.irs.com/articles/2015-federal-tax-rates-personal-exemptions-and-standard-deductions 2015 Federal Tax Rates, Personal Exemptions, and Standard Deductions IRS Tax Brackets and Deduction Amounts for Tax Year 2015], from the IRS.&lt;/ref&gt;  You also need to update the personal exemption and standard deduction data.  After updating these numbers click on the appropriate check boxes to indicate if you and /or your spouse is over the age of 65 (or blind).  The spreadsheet will calculate your appropriate standard deduction and again transfer the yellow background numbers to the spreadsheets.

There is another tab called [PIA]. Before using this tab you should contact Social Security to get your personal PIA (Primary Insurance Amount) for your normal retirement age (NRA).  You can then use the Social Security [http://www.ssa.gov/oact/quickcalc/early_late.html Early or Late Retirement] page to calculate the percentage of your benefit that you will get based on the month and year you plan to retire.  Use the table at the bottom of this page to calculate and save your benefit amounts for your various “What If” scenarios. 

You can then use the [Incomes] tab to itemize and sum up the remaining 5 income fields you will need.

Once all of this information is available you are ready to start creating your personalized Marginal Tax Rate graphs and What If tax savings charts.
{{clear}}

==A first look==

After you download the spreadsheet you can fill in your own private income information to create a graph of what your personal marginal tax brackets will be.  Just choose the [Single] or [Married] tab based on your filing status.

[[Image:Single63K.jpg|left]]You only have to fill in the 6 yellow cells in the upper left corner of the spreadsheet to create a chart based on your retirement tax situation.  The shape of the red line will be determined by your personal Social Security Benefits and your Long Term Gain income.  The orange tick mark will show you the relationship between your gross taxable income level and your marginal tax rates.
The numbers used on this graph were chosen specifically to represent an upper middle class individual whose gross income of $63,000 places them just at the start of The Hump marginal tax rates.

The COLA (Cost-of-Living Adjustment) cell is a very important feature of the spreadsheet.  It allows you to estimate your potential tax situation as the cost of living changes.  The actual marginal rates are not based on the values you entered at the top of the graph, they are based on the values at the bottom of the graph that have been adjusted by the COLA rate.  The tax brackets, exemptions and standard deductions are also modified by the same COLA value.
COLA was originally designed to allow you to look a few years into the future, but negative values also allow you to look into the past and this can reveal a something very important, your personal tax situation will most likely get worse with inflation.
{{clear}}

==Historical Impact==

The COLA entry was designed to let you look into the future to see what will happen when the cost of living goes up, but it can also be used to give rough estimates of historical representations of the system.  The Social Security Administration publishes a list of yearly Index Factors that can be used to convert historical dollars into today’s dollars.  The index factor for 1983, the year that the first Social Security taxability amendment was passed, is 3.05.  Using this Index Factor in reverse, a COLA factor of -67% can be used to change today’s dollars into 1983 dollars.
{|
|+ '''1983'''
|-
||[[File:Hump1983.jpg]]
|}
 
Note how the orange income values are now 33% of today’s incomes.  Also note that the adjusted orange Upper Middle Class gross income tick mark in 1983 is considerably less than the start of the 50% taxation point created in 1983 which is represented by the dotted green line.
{|
|+ '''1993'''
|-
||[[File:Hump1993.jpg]]
|}
 
Ten years later when the 85% taxation bracket was added by the 1993 amendment the index factor was now 2.01, an inflationary increase of about 33% over the 1983 value, but since the $25,000 taxability point for the 50% level did not change, an Upper Middle Class income was now close to making a portion of your Social Security benefit taxable.
{|
|+ '''2008'''
|-
||[[File:Hump2008.jpg]]
|}
 
World War II ended in Europe on May 8, 1945 which caused the baby boom generation to start in 1946.  Those born in 1946 reached their early Social Security retirement age of 62 in 2008.  The index factor for 2008 was 1.12 making the COLA adjustment about -10%.  The base $63,000 Middle Class Income we are using is now well into the 85% taxability bracket and nearly into the hump.
{|
|+ '''2020'''
|-
||[[File:Hump2020.jpg]]
|}
 
Using the COLA factor for its original intent, looking into the future, we see that the base Upper Middle Class income has now moved into the hump area.
Basically we have to plan to avoid the hump area by a reasonable margin so that inflation does not push us up against its proverbial brick wall for our standard of living during retirement.

Looking at the previous graphs you can see that the increases in your social security benefits push the start taxation points for those benefits to a higher dollar value while the gross income tick mark moves up faster because the start taxation point is a fixed value while the gross income is adjusted for inflation.  The [Historical] tab on the spreadsheet gives you a more detailed example of how this happens.
{{clear}}

==What if==

The spreadsheet also contains a pair of “What If” tabs, [Singles] and [Marrieds], which allow you to enter two sets of income values so you can compare the results.
 
[[Image:Wait2Years.jpg|right]]This is a married couple who wants to have a $100,000 after tax income during retirement.  Their current situation, the dark red line with the tallest orange tick mark, indicates they will be right at the start of their “Tax Hump”.  Their second option is to work part time and delay taking their Social Security benefits for two additional years.  This situation is represented by the lighter orange line and the tall red tick mark.  If they wait they will get more tax delayed income which will allow them to take more than $10,000 less out of their 401K accounts each year while staying a reasonable distance away from their new Tax Hump.

Note that their tax hump is bigger because their Social Security is higher but the higher Social Security also pushed the start of their Tax Hump further down their gross income stream.  Note also that their effective tax rate is considerably lower.
A special note here:  The [Singles] tab has a third line above the graph that is the sum of the two yellow lines.  This is designed so the tab can be used to compare the What If situation for a single individual and also used by a non-married couple who is planning to share expenses during retirement.

{|
|+ '''Tax savings if they wait'''
|-
||[[File:Wait2Savings.jpg]]
|}
{{clear}}
==Cost of money==

[[Image:CostOf6K.jpg|right]]What if your friends come to you with the idea of taking a cruise together each winter?  You will need an extra $6,000 of after tax money, how will you get it?
 
Your current retirement situation puts you right up against your personal tax hump.  The Cost Of money column lets you know that the cost of $6,000 of after tax spendable money will be $11,427 at a marginal tax bracket of 47.49%.  The small red tick marks also let you know that you will be over the hump and back in the 25% tax bracket after paying for just one cruise.  A second cruise will now only cost you $8,000 at the 25% bracket.

If you do not have a picture of what is happening you will probably not withhold enough taxes and have a huge tax bill the following April, after all, your effective tax rate so far has only been 6.8%.  Without the picture why would it be 47.49% now?  You might also do the proper calculation for this year only and start paying $11,427 each year for each cruise.  If you do have this picture you can see that additional cruises will only cost $8,000, a $3,427 savings for each additional year.

{{clear}}

==Roth IRA conversions==

A [[Roth IRA]] account is an excellent source of non-taxable income during retirement.  Your money grows tax free and dollars taken from a Roth during retirement do not cause the taxable portion of your Socials Security to increase.  Unfortunately your annual contributions to a Roth account are limited to $5,500 before the age of 50 and $6,500 after the age of 50.  One way around these limitations is the [[Roth IRA conversion]].  You are allowed to convert Traditional IRA holdings into a Roth IRA account if you pay the taxes on the amount that you convert.  If you take your taxes out of the funds you transfer:

* If your pre-retirement and retirement tax rates are the same the ending after tax dollars are the same, you are just paying your taxes today instead of when you withdraw the money.
* If you can convert the funds at 25% today to avoid the 27.75% marginal bracket in retirement, 15% at the 85% taxation level, your financial gain will be 2.75%.
* If you can convert funds at 25% or 28% today to avoid the 46.25% or 55.5% marginal brackets in retirement your financial gains will be substantial.

{|
|+ '''Roth IRA Conversion'''
|-
||[[File:TheHump-ROTH.jpg]]
|}

And if you can pay the tax out of non-retirement accounts, the conversion would be more advantageous.

What if you are already retired and stuck in a situation where you will be over The Hump each year or just for an unexpected expense this year? That also means that you are back to the 25% and then 28% standard tax brackets. You could do a very large conversion of a portion of your Traditional IRA to Roth at those lower brackets so that you could replace a portion of your taxable income with non-taxable income in future years. Just remember that there are penalties involved if you use the converted funds within 5 years of the conversion. Plan ahead! If you need $7,000 a year to feel comfortable then you should do your conversion every time your Roth account gets down to $35,000 so that you have $7,000 a year for 5 years before you need to use the newly converted money.

{{clear}}

==The marriage penalty==
[[Image:MarriagePenalty.jpg|right]]
The 1983 Social Security Amendment set the start of the 50% taxability of your benefits at $25,000 for a single individual and $32,000 for a married couple.

The 1993 Social Security Amendment set the start of the 85% taxability of your benefits at $34,000 for a single individual and $44,000 for a married couple.

Since the married couple’s start points are less than double the single individual’s start points their combined Social Security Benefits become taxable earlier.  In the long run they will not pay more tax, but they do pay their taxes earlier which is a penalty to them at certain income levels.

The [Compare] tab of the spreadsheet allows you to enter the income levels for a single individual.  It will then double those amount for the married couple and plot both marginal tax lines on a per capita scale.
 
{{clear}}

==Adjusting your income sources==

[[Image:Married63x2at10k.jpg|left]]If the married couple in the previous example was not aware of their choices they would just continue to pay an extra $5,090 more in taxes each year than their single friends living next door sharing retirement expenses.  If they knew about this situation before retirement they could have planned to move some of their retirement income to non-taxable sources like a Roth account.

In this example they were able to find a $7,500 annual source of non-taxable income which allowed them to reduce their traditional IRA withdraws by $13,750 and reduce their taxes by $6,249 while keeping their after tax income constant.

The creation of $7,500 would have cost them $10,000 at the 25% level and $10,417 at the 28% level prior to retirement.  This is a huge improvement over the $13,750 cost during retirement for the same after tax income level.

Just remember that you have a 5 year waiting period before you can withdraw newly converted Roth funds without paying a penalty.

Keeping in mind that this article is not being written by a financial advisor or tax accountant, there many other ways to create relatively tax free income during retirement.  You might be able to take a portion of your pension as a lump sum.  You might consider a reverse mortgage.
{{clear}}

==Conclusion==

The important thing to take from this article is that ''The Hump'' exists and it is very important for you to understand your current or eventual retirement income situation as it relates to ''The Hump''.  The earlier you start planning to avoid it, the better off you will be in retirement.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' provides the legal basis for [[Medicare]] premium deductions and federal taxes withheld from your [[Social Security]] monthly payment. The legal basis for rounding the payment amount is also described. Examples are provided at the end of this article.

Except for the introduction and legal overview, this article is based on {{Forum post| p = 6105815 | title = Re: Wiki - Social Security payment deductions| author = sscritic via LadyGeek | date = July 7, 2021}} (contains a link to the original post with updates).

==Introduction==
Social Security may withhold amounts from your monthly benefit. Known as a ''deduction'', part of your payment may be withheld for:&lt;ref name="Deduct"&gt;{{Cite web|author=|title=Definition: Deductions|url=https://www.ssa.gov/help/myCYB_deductions.html|publisher=Internal Revenue Service|date=|accessdate=July 5, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Medicare Premium payments,
*Overpayment of Social Security or [[Planning for disabled adult children#Supplemental Security Income (SSI)|Supplemental Security Income (SSI)]] benefits,
*Excess earnings,
*Voluntary income tax withholding,
*Payment of your appointed representative.

The federal government can also garnish benefits in certain circumstances.&lt;ref name="Deduct" /&gt;

This article only focuses on Medicare Premium and voluntary income tax withholding deductions.

==Legal overview==
{{See also|Tax basics#Hierarchy of tax authority|label 1 = Hierarchy of tax authority }}

Authority for federal agencies is based on US law and is codified here: [https://uscode.house.gov/ Office of the Law Revision Counsel], by the  United States House of Representatives.

Relevant sections of the actual US law directing Social Security to deduct Medicare and federal taxes from your payment, as well as rounding your payment amount, are shown.

Law is cited in a format as "(title number) U.S.C. § (section number).". For example, US Code Title 42 Section 415 is cited as "42 U.S.C. § 415.".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=|title=§ 2-300. How to Cite Constitutions, Statutes, and Similar Materials|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/citation/2-300|publisher=Cornell University Law School (Legal Information Institute)|date=|accessdate=July 6, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The actual US law cited in the following section uses "USC" instead of "U.S.C."&lt;/ref&gt;

Social Security employees use the [https://secure.ssa.gov/apps10/ Program Operations Manual System] (POMS) as the primary source of information to process benefit claims. The POMS is shown where applicable.

===Social Security program rules===

The Social Security program is defined by rules which include the law; regulations; Commissioner rulings; and, employee operating instructions.

See: [https://www.ssa.gov/regulations/ Social Security Program Rules]

The law which governs Social Security is defined in the Social Security Act. [https://www.ssa.gov/OP_Home/ssact/ssact.htm Compilation of Social Security Laws] (Volume I) contains the full text of the Social Security Act, as amended, and selected provisions of the Internal Revenue Code.

In the [https://www.ssa.gov/OP_Home/ssact/ssact-toc.htm Social Security Act Table of Contents], drill down each Title section to find the relevant sections of US code which modify the Social Security Act.

For example, [https://www.ssa.gov/OP_Home/ssact/title18/1800.htm Title XVIII] "Health Insurance for the Aged and Disabled" --&gt; [https://www.ssa.gov/OP_Home/ssact/title18/1840.htm Sec. 1840. Payment of premiums] Results in:

:Sec. 1840. [42 U.S.C. 1395s] (a)(1)...

which means that Section 1840 of the Social Security Act appears in US Code under Title 42 Section 1395s. This is the Medicare premium withholding as described below.

For this article, the relevant sections of the Social Security Act are located in US Code as follows:

*Sec. 215 [42 U.S.C. 415]: Computation of primary insurance amount
*Sec. 1840. [42 U.S.C. 1395s] Payment of premiums 
*Sec. 1854. [42 U.S.C. 1395w–24] Premiums and Premium Amounts 
*Sec. 1860D-13. [42 U.S.C. 1395w-113] Premiums; Late Enrollment Penalty

==Payment deduction examples==
Note that your actual benefit is not what is in the letter they send you.

=== Example 1===
Under 65, no income tax withholding:
*Benefit = $2764.80
*Deposit received = $2764 (this will be in your benefit letter, not the actual benefit of $2764.80)

===Example 2===
Under 65, income tax withholding of 7%:
*Benefit = $2764.80
*Benefit paid = $2764 (benefit in your letter = $2764)
*Withholding calculated = $193.48
*Withheld amount = $193.50 (nearest dime)
*Deposit received = $2570.50

===Example 3===
65 plus, Part B, no income tax withholding:
*Benefit = $2764.80
*Part B premium = $148.50
*Benefit after Part B = $2616.30
*Deposit received = $2616 (benefit in your letter = $2764.50, so net is whole dollar after Part B)

===Example 4===
65 plus, Part B, income tax withholding of 7%:
*Benefit = $2764.80
*Part B premium = $148.50
*Benefit after Part B = $2616.30
*Benefit paid = $2616 (benefit in your letter = $2764.50)
*Withholding calculated = $183.12
*Withheld amount = $183.10 (nearest dime)
*Deposit received = $2432.90

===Example 5===
65 plus, IRMAA (B and D), income tax withholding 25%:
*Benefit = $2764.80
*Part B premium = $475.20
*Benefit after Part B = $2289.60
*Benefit dollar rounded = $2289 (benefit in your letter = $2764.20, so whole dollar after Part B)
*Part D premium = $70.70
*Benefit after Part D subtracted = $2218.30
*Withholding calculated = $554.58 (after reduction for premiums)
*Withheld amount = $554.60 (nearest dime)
*Deposit received = $1663.70

A '''Primary Insurance Amount (PIA)''' is used to determine not only Social Security old-age benefits, but disability benefits and benefits as a wife, husband, ex-wife, ex-husband, widow, widower, widow of previously divorced husband (now deceased), widower of previously divorced wife (now deceased), the mother of a child of a deceased parent, father of a child of a deceased parent, the child of a deceased parent, as well as the parent of someone who is deceased.

==Reason to know how to compute a PIA==
Knowing how the Social Security Administration (SSA) computes the PIA allows you to understand what it is or even to compute it for yourself.  Like doing long division, the process is not difficult, but it can seem tedious.  For most cases, SSA uses the Average Indexed Monthly Earnings Method.

If you prefer to use off-the-shelf tools, or would like some examples when creating your own spreadsheet, two publicly available spreadsheets are
* The 'SocialSecurity' tab of the [[Tools and calculators#Personal finance toolbox|Personal finance toolbox]]
* The [https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=262772 Downloadable Social Security Benefit Estimator]

There is also a web tool that includes explanations of calculation steps in its output:
* [https://ssa.tools/calculator.html Social Security Calculator]

Given a PIA (or both PIAs for a couple), a web tool that helps evaluate SS benefit start dates is
* [https://opensocialsecurity.com/ Open Social Security: Free, Open-Source Social Security Calculator]

==Types of PIA computations==
The following covers the PIA for someone who pays into the Social Security System and lives to age 62 without going on disability.  There are other methods for those who become disabled, die before age 62, or who spend most of their career not covered by Social Security.

==Steps==
To start, you want to find the Average Indexed Monthly Earnings (AIME).  Indexing refers to adjusting the covered earnings (earnings on which social security tax is paid) in a given year relative to the national average wage in the year you turn 60.

Given numbers:

* Indexing year: the year turn 60
* National Average Wage Index (NAWI) for indexing year, either known or estimated&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ssa.gov/oact/cola/AWI.html National Average Wage Index] &lt;/ref&gt;

'''First step:''' Use a spreadsheet to index the earnings and find the top 35 years

* Column 1: Year, starting with first year that has covered earnings, e.g., 1974
* Column 2: Covered earnings for year in column 1
* Column 3: Covered earnings times NAWI for indexing year
* Column 4: NAWI for year in column 1
* Column 5: For years up to age 60: Column 3 divided by Column 4: covered earnings times NAWI for indexing year divided by NAWI for given year rounded to the cent.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;To index earnings:

* Multiply the posted earnings up to the maximum creditable for each year after 1950 up to the indexing year by the average wages of all workers for the indexing year; and
* Divide the result by the average earnings of all workers for the year being indexed. Carry to three decimal places and round to the nearest cent; i.e., if third decimal place is 4 or less, round down; if 5 or more, round up

Source: POMS (Program Operations Manual System), RS 00605.018 Total Earnings in Computation Years Under the 1978 NS Method - Indexing the ER ([https://secure.ssa.gov/apps10/poms.nsf/lnx/0300605018 link])
&lt;br&gt;
Some web pages give factors that are to be multiplied by covered earnings, but these are not correct, as the official rules says the order of operations is multiply before divide, not divide before multiply. The output of the [https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/anypia/anypia.html anypia calculator] shows the product of the multiplication before the division and rounding.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Column 5: For years after age 60: covered earning
* Column 6: Same as Column 5 if one of the highest 35 numbers in Column 5 (these are the top 35 indexed earnings); otherwise 0

'''Second step:''' Find the AIME

* Add the top 35 indexed years in Column 6
* Divide the result by 420, the number of months in 35 years
* Round down to the nearest whole dollar
* This is the Average Indexed Monthly Earnings

'''Third step:''' Find the bend points for the indexing year

* 1st bend point: Multiply the NAWI for the indexing year by 180 and divide by 9,779.44, the NAWI for 1977, the base year. Round down to the dollar.
* 2nd bend point: repeat replacing 180 by 1085.

'''Fourth step:''' Find the PIA

* The PIA at eligibility (age 62) is the sum of a three‐part formula:
* 90% of AIME up to and including the first bend point, plus
* 32% of AIME from the first bend point to the second bend point, plus
* 15% of AIME above the second bend point.

'''Fifth step:''' Recompute the PIA using the same bend points if new covered earnings change the AIME (e.g., the top 35 years of earnings (indexed or not) have changed since age 62)

'''Sixth step:''' Apply cost of living increases from age 62 onward.  The COLA is applied to the most recent PIA, then rounded down to the nearest dime. Repeat for any subsequent years.

=== Example ===
Born in 1954 (after 1/1). Turn 60 in 2014. National Average Wage Index (NAWI) for 2014 = 46,481.52.

'''First step''' (for an example year):

* Col 1: Year 2000.
* Col 2: Covered earnings = 70,000.
* Col 3: 70,000 times 46,481.52 = 3,253,706.40
* Col 4: NAWI for 2000 = 32,154.82
* Col 5: 3,253,706.40 / 32,154.82 = 101,188.76

'''Second step:'''

* Sum of top 35 years = 3,246,723.58 for example
* AIME = 3,246,723.58 / 420 = 7,730.294 rounded down to 7,730

'''Third step:'''

Bend points for 2016 eligibility (indexing year 2014).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Benefit Formula Bend Points|url=https://www.ssa.gov/oact/cola/bendpoints.html|access-date=March 27, 2022|website=Social Security Administration}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* 1st bend point = 46481.52 times 180 divided by 9779.44 = 855.54 rounded to 856.
* 2nd bend point = 46481.52 times 1085 divided by 9779.44 = 5156.99 rounded to 5157.

'''Fourth step:'''

Since the AIME of 7730 is greater than 5157, the PIA is

0.9 (856) + 0.32 (5157 - 856) + 0.15 (7730 - 5157) = 770.4 + 1376.32 + 385.95 = 2532.67 rounded down to the nearest dime = 2532.60. This is the PIA as of 2016, the year of eligibility.

'''Fifth step:'''

Assume covered earnings in 2016 do not change the AIME, but covered earnings in 2017 replace an earlier lower earning year and increase the AIME from 7,730 to 7,750.

Since the AIME of 7750 is greater than 5157, the PIA is

0.9 (856) + 0.32 (5157 - 856) + 0.15 (7750 - 5157) = 770.4 + 1376.32 + 388.95 = 2535.67 rounded down to the nearest dime = 2535.60. This is the recomputed year of eligibility PIA as of 2018 (includes earnings through 2017).

'''Sixth step:'''

The cost-of-living increases for 2016 and 2017 were 0.3% and 2.0%.  Since the PIA after including the new earnings is 2535.60, multiplying by 1.003 gives 2543.21, which results in a new PIA 2543.20 when rounded down to nearest dime.  Repeating with a COLA of 2.0 gives a value of 2594.06 which rounds down to 2594.00. This is the PIA as of 2018.

== Find your benefit ==
With the PIA in hand (and perhaps the PIA of another person, say a husband or wife), benefit formulas (of which there are many) can be used to find a particular benefit. A good source for benefit formulas is the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 20 – Employees’ Benefits, Chapter III – Social Security Administration Part 404 – Federal Old-Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance (1950- ), Subpart D ([https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-20/chapter-III/part-404/subpart-D?toc=1 link]).
