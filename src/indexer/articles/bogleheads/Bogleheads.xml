Welcome to the Bogleheads' '''Getting started''' page. There is a lot of information available to help. Take your time and get organized.

The [[The Bogleheads | Bogleheads]] focus on ''Investing Advice Inspired by John Bogle''. We are part of his campaign "''to give ordinary investors a fair shake.''"

The site consists of this wiki, the [https://www.bogleheads.org/blog/ Bogleheads blog] and the [http://www.bogleheads.org/forum/index.php Bogleheads forum]. The wiki, blog and forum were built by volunteers who are dedicated to helping people begin or improve their investing by applying our investing principles.

==Introduction==
Bogleheads emphasize regular saving, broad diversification, and sticking to an investment plan regardless of market conditions. We follow a small number of simple investment principles that proved over time to produce risk-adjusted returns far greater than those achieved by the average investor. They have been further distilled and explained in thousands of posts on the forum.

The power of the wiki is its ability to link content. If a topic has a link, there is more material available. This is not a structured course. Use those links to explore anything you want, and consider bookmarking this page in case you get lost. The start-up kits below are designed to help you begin or improve your investing journey.

==Bogleheads investment philosophy==
We suggest you start your journey by reading the [[Bogleheads® investment philosophy|Bogleheads investment philosophy]] first. In short, this is:
{| class="wikitable"
! Prepare to invest !! Create a portfolio !! Maintain discipline
|-
| style="vertical-align: top;" |
* Live below your means
* Develop a workable plan
* Never bear too much or too little risk
* Invest early and often
| style="vertical-align: top;" |
* Diversify
* Invest with simplicity
* Use index funds where possible
* Minimize costs
* Minimize taxes
| style="vertical-align: top;" |
* Never try to time the market
* Stay the course&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The phrase "''stay the course''" just means "stick closely to your plan." For an explanation of the term, and its origin, see: {{cite web| publisher=Wikipedia| url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stay_the_course| title=Stay the course| accessdate=July 16, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an issue facing investors holding assets in [[Asset allocation in multiple accounts|multiple accounts]], both tax-advantaged and taxable accounts. The tax code recognizes different sources of investment income which are taxed at different rates, or, are taxed at a later time (tax "deferred"). An asset's tax efficiency (the impact of taxes on an investment) is affected by both its expected return and the tax rate on that return.

Some fund types, like total market stock index funds, are extremely tax-efficient, because they produce low dividends (that are mostly [[qualified dividend|qualified]]) and capital gains. By contrast, bond funds can be extremely tax-inefficient, because the interest they produce every year is taxed at your full marginal tax rate. Other tax-inefficient investments are REITs, small value funds, and actively managed funds that frequently churn their holdings. Put tax-inefficient funds into tax-advantaged accounts to the extent possible.

All investors must pay their legally required taxes. This article describes how to minimize taxes by placing investments appropriately in tax-deferred or taxable (pay taxes now) accounts.
{{Warning|Determining your [[Asset allocation|asset allocation]] (% stocks / % bonds), which sets your portfolio's level of [[Risk#Asset Allocation | acceptable risk]], ''is the single most influential decision you can make'' on your portfolio's performance. Only consider taxes &lt;u&gt;after&lt;/u&gt; you have configured your total portfolio.}}{{Notice|Tax regulations can be complex and contain subtle details that may escape inexperienced investors. If this article seems overly complicated, then just remember a few key points:
*Set your asset allocation first; taxes come second. If you do not have any funds which can be put in a location to reduce your tax bill, then stop here. You have done the best you can.
*Tax rates and brackets change frequently. What was a logical tax location one year may turn out to be a poor choice a few years later. Consider if it is worth the effort (added complexity) to take this approach.
*Consider the [[#Criticisms_of_this_tax_placement_strategy|various criticisms]] of the suggested tax placement strategy.}}

==General strategy==
Because tax regulations are complex, and there are a lot of possible investment scenarios, the suggestions in this article do not apply to everyone. While there is no "one rule fits all" concept, the strategies here are mostly aimed at investors in the accumulation phase (saving for retirement).

In considering '''asset location''' keep the following points in mind:

*If your investments are &lt;u&gt;all&lt;/u&gt; in tax-advantaged accounts, fund placement will not have a large impact on your returns. ''Tax-advantaged'' accounts include tax-deferred accounts, such as traditional [[401(k)]], [[403(b)]], and [[Traditional IRA]], and the tax-free Roth versions of those accounts such as [[Roth IRA]].
*If you have a taxable account, first consider whether it is better to move the money into a tax-advantaged account by contributing more to a tax-advantaged account.
*If you are already contributing the maximum to every tax-advantaged account available to you, and you have additional funds to invest, you need to consider tax efficiency when choosing your funds.
*You should always establish an [[Emergency fund | emergency fund]] first, and then fund your work-based retirement account, HSA, or IRA ''before'' your taxable accounts. Tax-advantaged accounts are the most tax-efficient accounts, and you should not overlook them.

See [[Prioritizing investments]] for more on the points above.

If you have both tax-advantaged (retirement) and taxable accounts, you generally want to hold less tax-efficient assets in a tax-advantaged account and more tax-efficient assets in a taxable account. You need to consider both the return and the tax rate. With higher bond yields, conventional wisdom is to hold bonds in tax-advantaged accounts. Today low yields are common, and a bond fund with an expected return of less than 1% can be more tax efficient than a stock fund with an expected return of 7% even though the bond fund's return is taxed at a higher rate. It is best to understand the basic principles and then apply them to your situation.

===Advantages of taxable accounts===
The advantages for holding stocks in a taxable account include:

* Lower tax rates. In tax-advantaged accounts, all investments are taxed equally (not at all in a tax-free account, or only on withdrawal in a tax-deferred account). In taxable accounts, almost all the return on bonds are taxed at your full rate every year, but most of the return on stocks is tax-favored:
** Increases in stock prices do not lead to any tax until the stocks are sold, which offers an additional way for you to defer taxes.
** When you sell stocks, the tax is usually at the lower rate for long-term capital gains.
** If the stocks pay dividends, they are taxed every year, but [[Qualified dividend|qualified dividends]] are taxed at a lower rate.
* You can [[Tax loss harvesting | harvest losses]].
* You can [[Donating appreciated securities | donate appreciated shares]] to charity, avoiding all taxes.
* Estate planning; there is a potential for [[Step-up in basis|stepped-up cost basis]] upon death.

For example, suppose that you hold $10,000 in a stock index fund for 30 years, and it yields 2%, all qualified dividends are taxed at 15%, while earning 6% in increased stock prices for a pre-tax return of 8%. Every year, you pay 0.30% tax on the dividend, and reinvest the other 1.7%. After 30 years, you have $92,570, with a basis of $28,230 including reinvested dividends.

When you sell, you pay $9,651 tax on the $64,340 capital gain, for a final value of $82,719, an annual return of 7.30%. Despite the 15% tax rate, your returns were only 9% less than the tax-free rate because you deferred taxes on the capital gains. If you harvested losses, donated some of the stock to charity, or left some to your heirs, your return would be even higher.

The advantages for holding bonds in a taxable account include:

* Bonds have a lower expected return than stocks, and so sometimes a lower tax cost.
* Switching placement when necessary does not incur a large capital gains tax. If you hold stocks in a taxable account instead, large built-up unrealized capital gains makes it very difficult for you to switch, even if switching would otherwise be beneficial.
* Nominal [[Treasury bonds|treasury bonds]], [[TIPS]], and in-state [[Municipal bonds|muni bonds]] are not subject to the state income tax.
* The effective tax rate on muni bonds is usually much lower than the highest marginal tax rate on ordinary income.
* Interest from muni bonds is not included in Adjusted Gross Income (AGI), which determines eligibility for many income tax deductions and credits, whereas dividends and capital gains are included in AGI.

===Tax rates===
Tax rates are shown below:&lt;ref group="note"&gt; Mutual fund distributions and the tax consequences of selling funds are explained below:
*Short-term capital gains distributions are realized gains on securities held for one year or less. Your short-term gains are taxed at ordinary income tax rates. Mutual fund short-term gain distributions are included in a fund's [[Ordinary dividend | ordinary dividend]] distribution; therefore, capital losses may not be subtracted from these distributions when computing taxes.
*[[Capital gains distribution |Long-term capital gains distributions]] are realized gains on securities held for more than one year. You report these on tax Schedule D along with any other capital gains, and can offset them with capital losses.
*[[Qualified dividend]]s are the ordinary dividends.

A portion of your [[Ordinary dividend | ordinary dividend]] may be nonqualified because it can include items like these:
*'''Taxable interest'''. When a mutual fund receives taxable interest, the income gets paid out as a dividend. It is a dividend when it goes out of the mutual fund, but it was not a dividend when it came into the mutual fund, so it cannot be a qualified dividend.
*'''Nonqualified dividends'''. Your mutual fund may receive dividends that are nonqualified. For example, the mutual fund may sell shares just 35 days after buying them, but after receiving a dividend. The mutual fund has to hold the shares at least 61 days to have a qualified dividend. Any amount the mutual fund receives as a nonqualified dividend gets paid to you as a nonqualified dividend.
*'''Short-term capital gain'''. When a mutual fund has a short-term capital gain, it pays this amount to the mutual fund shareholders as an ordinary dividend.
*'''Holding mutual fund shares less than 61 days'''. Any dividend you receive on mutual fund shares held less than 61 days is a nonqualified dividend, even if the mutual fund reports that amount to you as a qualified dividend. You do not have to buy the shares 61 days before the dividend is paid, but the total amount of time you hold the shares (including time before and after the dividend) has to be at least 61 days.

Almost all of the dividends distributed by [[REIT |equity REITS]] come in the form of non-qualified dividends. Non-qualified dividends are taxed at marginal income tax rates.

*[[Tax loss harvesting | When you sell at a loss]] you will either offset capital gains which would have otherwise been taxed at your capital gains rate or you will offset income (up to $3,000 maximum per year) which would have otherwise been taxed at your marginal income tax rate, or both. If you offset capital gains that would have otherwise not been taxed at all (because your capital gains tax rate is 0%) then this part of the tax loss harvest may be an outright loss.
*The [[ACA net investment income tax|Affordable Care Act]] imposes a Medicare surcharge of 3.8% on all net investment income (NII) once the taxpayer's adjusted gross income exceeds $200,000 (single) or $250,000 (married); while this tax is not part of the income tax, it has the same effect on investors as a higher tax rate.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tax efficiency of various asset classes ==
The table below shows the ''approximate'' tax efficiency ranking of various asset class funds.

Given reasonable assumptions, the "Very inefficient", "Moderately inefficient" , and "Efficient" categories separate fairly clearly. The exact ordering within the categories depends not only on future tax policy, but also on assumptions about turnover, future returns, dividend yields, and qualified dividends.

A more complete discussion of bonds and bond funds, balanced funds, and stocks and stock funds follows.

See {{Forum link|t=242137| title=2017 Relative Tax Efficiency}} for specific examples of several mutual funds and ETFs.

||'''Notes:'''
*Tax exempt [[municipal bonds]] and [[Tax-managed fund comparison|Vanguard tax-managed funds]] are only suitable for taxable accounts.
*While this article considers tax efficient fund placement, note that savings bonds ([[EE savings bonds |series EE]] and[[ I savings bonds | series I]])&lt;ref group="note"&gt; Interest from EE and I Bonds accumulates tax-deferred for up to 30 years; may be tax free for qualifying educational expenses; and when taxed, is free from state and local income tax.&lt;/ref&gt; are only available in taxable accounts.
|}
====Tax efficiency of bonds====
Some investors see bonds or bond funds as tax-inefficient because almost all of the return comes from the dividend yield, which is fully taxed as ordinary income.&lt;ref group="note"&gt; Most bond funds also periodically distribute modest amounts of short term and long term gains.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, stocks get most of their return from price appreciation, which is not taxed until the stocks are sold and is taxed at the capital-gains tax rate. Therefore, these investors regard bonds as being less tax-efficient than stock index funds (which rarely sell stock) and hold bonds in tax-advantaged accounts when possible.

However, low-yielding bonds do not have much return to be taxed, and because they do not grow as fast as other investments, an equal percentage lost from an investment is a smaller dollar loss; this makes low-yielding bonds somewhat more tax-efficient. Therefore, some other investors do just the opposite: they hold stocks with a higher expected return in tax-advantaged accounts when possible. You have to strike a balance between the expected return and the tax rate.

[[Treasury bonds]] are exempt from state taxes, making them tax-inefficient for federal taxes, but they may be desirable taxable investments for investors who pay high state taxes but low federal taxes. [[TIPS]] have the same tax-efficiency as their treasury bond equivalents; however, because you need to pay taxes annually on the inflation component, and you do not receive this until the bond matures or is sold, this cash flow problem creates an additional reason to hold individual TIPS (as opposed to a fund) in a tax-advantaged account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.projectinvested.com/investor-guides/investorsguide-to-u-s-treasury-securities/| title=Investor's Guide to U.S. Treasury Securities| publisher=project:invested| accessdate=June 5, 2023}} &lt;/ref&gt;

[[Municipal bonds|Municipal bond]] funds have a hidden cost; while their interest incomes are not subject to federal tax, they usually earn less than [[Corporate bonds|corporate]] or treasury bond funds of comparable risk. (The risk may be of a different type; intermediate-term municipal bonds have more credit risk than long-term treasury bonds, but less interest-rate risk, and thus may have a similar after-tax yield.) There are special rules regarding the taxation of [[Social Security]] benefits - municipal bond interest in a taxable account may result in additional [[Taxation of Social Security benefits|Social Security benefits being taxable]].&lt;ref group="note"&gt; For a general guide to the taxation of municipal bonds, see [https://www.projectinvested.com/investor-guides/investors-guide-to-municipal-bonds/ Investor's Guide to Municipal Bonds], project:invested. Some municipal securities, including Build America Bonds, are taxable bonds. Interest income from Private activity municipal securities (and mutual funds that invest in them) is subject to the federal alternative minimum tax if the taxpayer is required to pay this tax.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tax efficiency of balanced funds====
[[Balanced fund|Balanced funds]] (stocks and bonds) are very popular among individual investors. These funds hold a variety of asset classes in one simple fund instead of several. They have a variety of names such as balanced, [[Vanguard LifeStrategy funds|lifestyle]], or [[Target date retirement funds|target retirement funds]]. Since these funds include both stocks and bonds their tax efficiency sits somewhere between stocks and bonds.

If you have a balanced fund in a taxable account, you cannot sell only the bonds (to hold bonds in a different account, or to hold fewer bonds, or to hold a different type of bonds); you have to sell the whole fund, which can result in realizing a capital gain.

In a taxable account, you pay tax on the bond dividends at ordinary income rates; in addition, you lose the option to harvest losses of individual asset classes. The more efficient strategy is to own the individual asset classes in separate funds and in their most tax-efficient locations.

====Tax efficiency of stocks====
Stock funds can be tax-inefficient if they generate a lot of capital gains, particularly short-term gains. They are also less efficient if they pay high dividends (although under current tax law, if most of the dividend stream is a [[Qualified dividend | "qualified" dividend]], the tax burden is reduced.) Actively managed stock funds with high turnover sell most of their stocks with gains, generating large taxable gains. Even low-turnover active funds tend to generate more gains than index funds in the same asset class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author1=Clemens Sialm| author2=Hanjiang Zhang| url=https://ssrn.com/abstract=2368625| title=Tax Efficient Asset Management: Evidence from Equity Mutual Funds| date=December 16, 2013}} Available at SSRN. &lt;/ref&gt;

[[Indexing|Index funds]] must also sell stocks which leave the index. Because both [[Small caps|small-cap]] and value stocks can migrate to a large-cap or a growth stock index when they rise in price, small-cap and value indexes tend to generate realized capital gains. [[Tax-managed fund comparison|Tax-managed funds]] (which are willing to deviate from the index to minimize taxes), [[Exchange-traded funds|ETFs]], and funds with an ETF class can eliminate many of these realized gains. Value indexes are less tax-efficient than growth or blend indexes because they have higher dividend yields; small-cap funds have lower dividend yields but fewer qualified dividends.

[[Real estate investment trust|REITs]], although they trade as stocks, must distribute almost all their income, and the income is taxable at the non-qualified dividend rate except for a small portion (historically about 15%) which is non-taxable because it compensates for depreciation of the property. Under the 2018 tax law changes, some of the income from REITs is treated as qualified business income; only 80% of that income is taxed.

If all else is equal, [[Domestic/International|international funds]] have a small tax advantage over US funds, because they are eligible for the [[Foreign tax credit | foreign tax credit]]. All else is not necessarily equal; if an emerging market is reclassified as developed, an emerging-markets index fund will have to sell all its stock in that country, infrequently generating a large capital gain. A fund including both developed and emerging markets such as [{{Vf | 0770}} Vanguard FTSE All-World ex-US Index Fund] or [{{Vf | 0113}} Vanguard Total International Index Fund] avoids this risk.

== Assigning asset classes to different accounts==
Treat your entire portfolio as a whole (include spouse).

*Consider what you already own. It may be inadvisable to pay additional taxes just to get a more tax efficient location. Even if your current location is not ideal it may be better to stick with certain aspects of it. This could mean keeping tax inefficient investments in a taxable account. Over time you can reduce the effect of a historically imposed asset location by not automatically reinvesting taxable distributions. Take any distributions in cash and reinvest them in a tax efficient manner.

=== Step 1: Categorize your portfolio's tax efficiency ===
Understand the tax consequences of holding each of your chosen investment assets based on the tax-efficiency of each asset class.

=== Step 2: Place your least tax efficient funds first ===
Fill your ''tax-advantaged'' accounts with your least efficient funds. Exhaust these accounts before putting these funds into your taxable account; if you run out of room, consider more tax-efficient alternatives, such as a stock index fund rather than an active fund or a muni bond fund rather than a total-market bond fund. An example portfolio with three asset classes (a total market US stock market index fund; a total market international stock market index fund, and an intermediate taxable bond fund,) is shown below. ''Note that in this scenario, we assume bond interest rates have a higher tax cost than stock investments.''

{|style="border-collapse: collapse; border: 1px solid #a2a9b1" &lt;!-- set border="1" to see table boundaries--&gt;
|+'''An example using three asset classes'''
||[[File:Slide2.JPG|center|650px]]
|}

=== Step 3: Placing international stock funds in the taxable account ===
It is sometimes possible to get tax credit for foreign taxes paid from international stock funds, but you lose this opportunity in tax-advantaged accounts. If all else is equal, the existence of the credit may make it advantageous to prioritize these funds in the taxable account. Whether or not the foreign tax credit is enough depends on factors such as the the percentage of the fund's foreign source income component, the foreign tax rate, the percentage of the foreign dividends that are qualified, and your US marginal tax bracket.

{|style="border-collapse: collapse; border: 1px solid #a2a9b1" &lt;!-- set border="1" to see table boundaries--&gt;
|+'''(Example) Consider foreign tax credit'''
||[[File:Slide3.JPG|center|650px]]
|}

=== Step 4: Place high growth stock funds ===
If all else is equal (and it often is not, because you may have different options in your 401(k) and your Roth IRA), it is slightly better to have the fund with the highest expected return in your Roth account or HSA, because these accounts are free from Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs),&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Roth IRAs are not subject to the RMD when held by the original owner, or after the owner's death, when rolled over into a spousal Roth IRA. Non spousal inheritors of a Roth IRA are subject to RMD rules.&lt;/ref&gt; are not counted as income for making Social Security taxable, and probably are less subject to the risk of changing tax rates.&lt;ref group="note"&gt; For simplicity, many people manage their asset allocation without regard to taxes. When Roth IRA accounts are much smaller than tax-deferred accounts this approximation works well. But it can be noted that moving the asset with the greatest expected future value from tax-deferred to a tax-free account does increase the risk/return of the investor. A simple way to view this [[Tax-adjusted asset allocation|tax-adjusted allocation]] for an investor in the 25% tax bracket is that the government is a 25% owner of the tax-deferred account. When moving an asset increases the investor's ownership of a high risk/return asset from 75% to 100% (in a Roth IRA), the overall portfolio risk-return increases as well.&lt;/ref&gt;

|+'''(Example) High growth stock fund placement'''
||[[File:Slide4.JPG|center|650px]]
|}

=== Step 5: Place tax efficient funds last ===
Tax-efficient funds are fine in any account. It is particularly easy to regularly [[rebalancing|rebalance]] your stock/bond ratio if you have enough room in your tax-advantaged accounts to hold some of your tax-efficient stock fund, because the stocks and bonds can be exchanged without tax consequence. Rebalancing in a taxable account is often best done by investing new money so that you can avoid capital gains.

==Criticisms of this tax placement strategy==
Because they have higher returns, equities can effectively expand your tax-advantaged space, leading to higher tax savings later on despite higher tax bills in the present. This is particularly true at low bond yields, when the tax penalty from bonds in taxable is not as high as it has been in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{forum link| p=1866211| title=Re: Delete Wiki on Tax-Efficient Asset Location}}, direct link to relevant post.&lt;/ref&gt;

The situation may change in retirement, when you withdraw the funds for income (decumulation phase). It is possible, under some combinations of lifetime investment results and lifetime individual tax situations, to be better off doing the opposite of the strategy recommended here.&lt;ref&gt;{{forum link| p=1858213| title=Re: Delete Wiki on Tax-Efficient Asset Location}}, direct link to relevant post.&lt;/ref&gt;

This article may be biased towards investors who can fill tax-advantaged space and are looking to invest more. However, some investors (especially those just starting out) cannot fill all this space. This can make this strategy confusing and possibly counterproductive if, for example, someone is buying international equities in taxable space without filling tax-advantaged space just to get the foreign tax credit.&lt;ref&gt;{{forum link| p=1857006| title=Re: Delete Wiki on Tax-Efficient Asset Location}}, direct link to relevant post.&lt;/ref&gt;

This article says that cash and low-yielding bonds are tax efficient, but then contradicts this somewhat by then classifying "most bonds" as tax inefficient. When interest rates are low, bonds are more tax-efficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{forum link| p=1857264| title=Re: Delete Wiki on Tax-Efficient Asset Location}}, direct link to relevant post. Also, the following post.&lt;/ref&gt; If bonds are tax-efficient now, and then yields rise to make them less tax-efficient, you can go from bonds in taxable to bonds in tax-advantaged with little, no, or negative tax cost; therefore, it is reasonable to hold bonds in a taxable account now and switch later if appropriate. In contrast, switching from stocks to bonds in taxable will result in a significant tax cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{forum link| p=1857293| title=Re: Delete Wiki on Tax-Efficient Asset Location}}, direct link to relevant post.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appendix: comparison of hypothetical tax costs ==
For buy and hold investors, the tax cost of holding a fund depends on how much the fund generates in taxable distributions, and the tax rate on those distributions. For long-term holdings, estimation of tax costs necessarily depends on assumptions about the expected returns and future tax policy, such as that long-term gains will continue to be taxed at a lower rate than short-term gains or bond interest; or that the tax preference for[[Qualified dividend | "qualified dividends"]] will extend into the distant future. The following tax costs math helps identify high tax cost candidates for tax-advantaged accounts.

Table 1 assumptions use historical data from Vanguard's index funds, which is used as a guide for qualified dividends, and the relative yields of value, small-cap, and tax-managed funds. Future capital gains are uncertain, but the table now assumes that all ETFs will avoid capital gains, as most ETFs have done so. Interest for bond funds is based on historical rates, not current rates, because the numbers are easy to measure; a bond which has a 6% yield loses 1.32% to taxes in a 22% tax bracket whether that is the current yield on a short-term bond or a long-term bond. The "tax cost" listed for municipal bonds is the hidden cost, the amount you lose in returns to avoid paying the tax; it is based on an assumption that municipal bonds yield 75% as much as taxable bonds of comparable risk.

Moreover, Table 1 is based on the assumption that foreign dividend yields will remain higher than US yields, as has been true since 2008; foreign yields are assumed to be 1.5 times US stock yields (before foreign taxes are withheld). ''If foreign yields become equal to US yields, then the tax costs of foreign funds must be multiplied by 2/3. Thus, in the table, US and foreign funds are about equally tax-efficient, but if foreign yields become lower, foreign funds will be somewhat more tax-efficient.''

There are two types of tax costs: the cost you pay every year, and the costs you pay when you sell. Bond funds have little or no tax cost when you sell, since almost all the return from bonds is from interest. When you sell a stock fund, you will pay capital-gains tax on the difference between the total amount you invested (including reinvested dividends) and the current value.

Table 2 indicates the additional cost for the capital-gains tax when you sell, assuming that you pay taxes on the distribution and reinvest the after-tax portion of the distribution; because it is a one-time cost, the effect is annualized. For example, if you hold an investment for 30 years and lose 10% to taxes when you sell, that is equivalent to losing 0.35% every year. If you sell the fund, your cost will be the sum of the Table 1 and Table 2 costs. However, you would not pay the Table 2 cost on any stock which you either leave to your heirs or donate to charity, and so may not pay that cost on your full investment. In particular, you might estimate your total tax cost by using the low-return line in Table 2; if stock returns are high, you will have a large taxable account and will reduce the tax cost by taking longer to deplete it or by not spending it all during your lifetime.

The tables use a 15% tax on qualified dividends and capital gains for an investor in the 22% bracket, and 23.8% (including the 3.8% Medicare surtax) on qualified dividends and capital gains, 40.8% on ordinary investment income, for an investor in the top 37% bracket. The final column of the second table (in the top tax bracket) assumes a tax rate of 0.46% for the tax-efficient fund, and 1.50% for the tax-inefficient fund. The [[Foreign tax credit | foreign tax credit]] is added to the dividend yield before computing taxes; for example, if a fund had $100 withheld in foreign taxes on dividends, and you pay $20 in taxes on the withheld dividends, you get a $100 credit for a net benefit of $80. Although not tabulated, keep in mind that investors in the lower tax brackets (12% or lower) pay no tax at all on qualified dividends and capital gains, and reap higher after-tax returns, outside of tax-exempt municipal bonds, in all asset classes.

===Example===
An investor in the 22% marginal tax bracket wants to compare the tax efficiency of a total-market index fund and a bond fund yielding 3% (0.66% tax cost). Because these funds are likely to be sold at some point, they can use Table 2 to project an estimate of the range (depending upon whether future returns are low or high) of the total annualized cost. The estimate shows that holding the bond fund in a tax-deferred account is likely to be slightly better over a long holding period; if the stock market returns are high, most of the stock will not be sold.

Because they can mean huge changes in a recipient's life, psychological and emotional factors&lt;ref group="note"&gt;A wide range of responses can accompany a financial windfall.

The National Endowment for Financial Education advises windfall recipients to do the following:&lt;ref name="NEFE" /&gt;

Stay calm, and do not make any hasty decisions. Set aside one year's living expenses and place the rest of the windfall into low risk investments (FDIC insured accounts, money market funds, treasury bills) for one year. As it may take as long as five years for you to adjust to a new life, this pause provides space for emotions to cool, helps avoid impulsive behavior, and, if warranted, allows you time to put together a team of professional advisers. Then, create a detailed plan to meet your highest priority financial goals, and track your progress over the years.

==Common sources of windfalls==
Windfalls come in many forms. Here are some common types:

* '''Legal settlements''': Settlements include personal injury settlements, settlements involving workers compensation and settlements of employment discrimination. Settlements may be a lump sum, or a structured settlement of annuity payments.
* '''Inheritances''': These often include retirement accounts and assets held in trust.
* '''Gifts''': These can range from annual gift exclusions up to the lifetime estate tax credit limit.
* '''Lottery winnings''': Taken as a series of payments; or as the sales value of payments exchanged for a lump sum.
* '''Insurance settlements''': These can be death benefits received as either a lump sum or annuity; as pre-death cash surrender values; or as life settlements, the sale of a life insurance policy by the owner to a third party in exchange for a lump sum.
* '''Retirement lump sums''': Usually taken in lieu of a lifetime series of annuity payments
* '''Sudden increases in income''': These can be bonus payments; stock options; or cashing shares in an IPO.

Other common sources of large lump sums include:&lt;ref name="Guide"&gt;{{cite book| title=The Bogleheads' Guide To Investing| title-link=Bogleheads' Guide To Investing| chapter=Chapter 15. How to Manage a Windfall Successfully| page=180| publisher=Wiley| isbn=978-0-471-73033-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A real estate sale
* The sale of a business
* Widowhood and divorce

Selling businesses or real estate converts an illiquid asset into large sums of cash. Death and divorce not only cause dislocation and trauma, but often suddenly thrust someone with little or no interest or no experience in investing, into having to manage family wealth.

==Size of a windfall==

Windfall sizes vary dramatically. A small windfall might bring you a step closer to your financial goals, a bigger one may make you financially independent, and an enormous windfall might be more money than you ever imagined spending. Windfall size is somewhat relative to your income and assets; what would be a life-changing amount of money for one person might only accelerate someone else's mortgage payoff by a few years. Some thresholds are more absolute, such as the Federal [[estate and inheritance tax|estate tax]] exemption ($15&amp;nbsp;million for singles and $30&amp;nbsp;million for married couples as of 2026&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-25-67.pdf|title=Notice 2025-67|publisher=IRS|accessdate=27 November 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;); financial planners generally agree that you need additional planning with assets above this level.

This wiki article aims to offer guidance for windfalls that are ''relatively'' large compared to your income and assets, enough to entail significant lifestyle changes and the need for additional planning. It applies to a wide variety of windfall types, sources, and absolute sizes. Use the guidance that is most relevant to your individual situation.

==Common pitfalls==

Common errors of commission made by windfall recipients include:&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web| url=https://www.stephenlnelson.com/WindfallFinancialPlanning.htm| title=Financial Planning for a Windfall in Wealth: Lotteries, Stock Options, Inheritances and Other Surprises| author=Stephen L. Nelson| accessdate=August 11, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* quitting your job prematurely
* buying extravagantly priced automobiles or properties, or other expensive consumption spending
* feeling overconfident about your business or investing acumen, jumping into new high risk investments (such as hedge funds) or as an "angel" investor in start-up companies
* falling prey to overcomplicated estate and investment management schemes. Watch out for people who might try to exploit you or take advantage of your new wealth. You can be a target for all kinds of financial schemes. 
* by being too generous to family, friends, and charities

Common errors of omission include failing to:

* pay the legally required taxes
* choose risk-appropriate investments and earn a reasonable return on invested capital
* use appropriate accounts such as retirement plans
* engage with the right professionals
* set up the appropriate plans, including estate plans

==Preparing==

These initial steps will help position you to manage a life-changing amount of money: 

===Take your time===

Avoid immediate impulse decisions. This is key to prudent windfall management. Among recommendations for this period are:
* Tell as few people as possible. Unfortunately, even those close to you may become resentful or solicit you for gifts when they hear about your windfall. You can always tell people later on when you have had time to consider the effect it may have on your relationships. 
* Set aside six months to one year's worth of expenses in an accessible account, such as your checking account. Place the remaining windfall assets in separate accounts holding secure low-risk savings vehicles, such as FDIC guaranteed bank accounts and [[Certificate of Deposit|CD]]s, [[Money Markets|money market funds]], and [[Treasury bill|treasury bills]].
* Use this time to begin resolving emotional, family, and social issues. Different sources of windfall, such as the death of a loved one, may have powerful emotional consequences that you should focus on addressing, while spending minimal time worrying about finances. Coming to terms with your emotions will allow you to make better financial decisions.&lt;ref group="note"&gt; The emotional and social issues surrounding windfalls are explored in greater detail in the following links:

* Hire a competent and unbiased tax professional, such as Certified Public Accountant (CPA), if you do not already have one. You may need to file estimated taxes. Complex tax issues may surround distributions from retirement plans, inheritances, and lottery winnings, as well as the exercise of stock options. If you are not sure if your windfall has tax consequences, many tax professionals will be willing to give you a free consultation. Prefer someone who does not sell investment products.
* If you have more complex finance issues that should not wait at least 6-12 months, skip ahead to the ''[[#Get_help|Get help]]'' step and pay a fair hourly rate for consultation from a fiduciary financial advisor, preferably one with a CFP or CFA certification. Urgent financial issues include having to decide whether to receive a lump sum or annuity stream; having a large amount of high-interest debt; or facing imminent eviction, foreclosure, or collection action due to delinquent debts. The focus of the consultation should just be resolving your urgent issues, not necessarily developing a complete financial plan or investing capital. The goal is not to begin putting your money to work, but rather to reduce stress and distractions by stabilizing your financial situation. Only make the minimum payments that will allow you to focus on the future, and do not redirect payments from paid-off debts to more spending.

====Lump sum vs. annuity====
{{Main|Lump sum vs pension}}

Choosing between a lump sum or a stream of payments can be complex. Factors include your financial goals, expected investment performance, taxes, inflation protection, life expectancy, estate planning goals, financial health of the annuity provider, and others. If you are at all unsure of the best course of action, a consultation with a fee-only fiduciary financial advisor would be extremely valuable. However, most windfall recipients should lean strongly toward choosing the annuity, for these reasons:

* You are less likely to squander the windfall. You can lose a lump sum with just one bad financial decision, whereas squandering an annuity requires a series of many bad choices, and not learning from prior mistakes.
* The most common reason to choose a lump sum is expecting a higher rate of return than the effective rate of return of the annuity. However, most windfall recipients are investment novices who are less likely to reliably generate high returns from their investments. This makes the protection of principal plus guaranteed return of the annuity more attractive in comparison.
* You have less ''need'' to earn a high return, so the guaranteed return of the annuity is more likely to be adequate to support a comfortable and prosperous lifestyle.

This reasoning is very similar to why windfall recipients should [[#Debts|pay off existing debts and avoid taking on new ones]]. These as well as any more general reasons that may apply, such as tax savings.

===Think about goals===

Begin to think about your long term goals, with more focus on the life you would like to create and (for now) less focus about how to achieve it. Some ideas for goals that may be meaningful:

* Retiring, either in the short or long term
* Cutting back hours at work, or dropping less desirable shifts or jobs
* Changing jobs
* Starting a business
* Going back to school, either to pursue a new career or just for enjoyment
* Saving money for benefit of a loved one ([[529 plan]] for education, trust fund, helping pay for a wedding or house down payment, etc.)
* Moving to another city, or country
* Paying off debts
* Certain consumer purchases
* Purchasing real estate
* Traveling
* Taking up a new hobby
* Growing your family
* Donating to charity
* Volunteering your time

Even a very large windfall will probably not be enough to fully fund all or even most of these goals, so it is important to prioritize your goals, both by overall priority, and by the time it will take you to reach them. Many financial novices are surprised how ''little'' of a windfall they are actually able to spend immediately. For example, a $1&amp;nbsp;million windfall will only generate about $30-40,000 per year of investment income over the long run, so you will need to limit your initial spending so that the windfall can provide a lasting improvement in lifestyle. You can then formalize your specific goals, and allocation of money toward them, later in a written financial plan.

===Get educated===

Like it or not, you now have a new job (in addition to any other jobs you may already have) - learning how to manage money. Whether or not you are inclined to "do-it-yourself", you will need at least the knowledge necessary to evaluate financial professionals. Learning about personal finance and investing will likely be, by far, the most money you will ever "earn" per hour, if it makes the difference between lifelong prosperity and a fortune squandered within a few years. 

* Read some [[Book recommendations and reviews|recommended books]] on personal finance and investing. Reading at least three, that cover the topics of personal finance and investing, would be a good start.
* Browse the rest of the [[Main Page|Bogleheads wiki]]. Many articles are written to be accessible to readers with little or no investing experience.

===Get help===

Unless you are already an experienced investor, it may be beneficial to hire a professional, at least for some initial guidance. If you decide to use an adviser, in chapter 16 of ''[[Bogleheads' Guide To Investing|The Bogleheads' Guide To Investing]]'' the authors recommend choosing an adviser who has earned a CFA (Chartered Financial Analyst) or a CFP (Certified Financial Planner) designation; uses a fee-only payment arrangement; and advocates an index fund investing approach. Fee-only compensation minimizes the advisor's conflicts of interest with your own financial success. A good financial advisor should be able to do the following:

* Calculate whether it is better to receive a lump sum or annuity stream of payments from a settlement, lottery winning, or retirement package
* Strategize about how to minimize taxes owed
* Recommend an investment strategy
* Recommend any additional types of insurance you may need, or what current types of insurance you hold may no longer be needed
* Determine whether you need to enlist an estate planning attorney&lt;ref group="note"&gt; The authors of ''[[Bogleheads' Guide To Investing|The Bogleheads' Guide To Investing]]'' recommend [https://www.martindale.com/ Martindale-Hubbell] for checking out the credentials of an attorney. &lt;/ref&gt; 
You can get free portfolio reviews and answers to personal finance questions on the [https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/index.php Bogleheads forums]. Most forum members are not finance professionals, but are nonetheless experienced investors, and as a whole have managed an enormous range of income and assets.

Whether you should retain a [https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Financial_planner financial planner] for a long time, or do your own investing using the [[Bogleheads® investment philosophy|Bogleheads investment philosophy]] or similar, is a personal choice. When you have time, consider the "[[Getting_started|getting started]]" wiki article (and the rest of this one). The more you learn, the better you will be able to judge whether an advisor is worth the cost to you.

==Creating a plan==

{{Quotation|Once you begin to become comfortable in your new financial reality, you may be ready for the successive phases, which include reviewing your situation and deciding how the money will be used. This is the fun part, when you'll choose -- with the help of... a solid financial plan -- whether to retire, buy a vacation home, donate to charities or set up trust funds for your children. The ultimate goal of all these steps is to create a sensible plan for handling your windfall that also allows you to come out with your relationships and sanity intact.|Susan Bradley|[https://web.archive.org/web/20161207071725/http://www.bankrate.com/finance/personal-finance/4-steps-to-profit-from-a-windfall-1.aspx 4 steps to profit from a financial windfall]}}

[[Financial planning|Financial planning]] is a ''long-term'' process&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Sound financial planning incorporates these steps: 
#Establish a relationship with a CFP professional
#Gather your data and develop your financial goals
#Analyze and evaluate your financial status
#Review your CFP professional’s recommendations
#Set your course
#Benchmark your progress against the financial goals you established
Source: [https://www.letsmakeaplan.org/other-resources/financial-planning-process Financial Planning Process], by the [https://www.letsmakeaplan.org Certified Financial Planner Board of Standards, Inc.]&lt;/ref&gt; of managing your finances so you can achieve your goals and dreams, while at the same time negotiating the financial barriers that inevitably arise in every stage of life. Fundamentally, the process for financial planning after receiving a windfall is the same as in any other situation. The only differences are:

* Larger amounts of money increase the relative importance of certain aspects of financial planning, such as tax planning and [[Tax-efficient fund placement|tax-efficient investing]], [[Index fund|minimizing investment costs]], [[Asset protection|asset protection]], and [[Estate planning|estate planning]].
* Windfall recipients are often thrust into a situation where they need to manage a large amount of money without having the necessary skills, knowledge, and experience. 
* Serious emotional impacts often surround windfalls, which you must deal with at the same time as financial planning.
* The consequences of financial mistakes are higher, in terms of absolute dollars, with larger amounts of money.

The core of financial planning is matching your goals, and the financial resources they will likely require, with your available resources. These can be your present resources, but also future investment proceeds and any future earnings. Matching requires knowing the costs of your goals (both up-front and ongoing), how much of your available funds will need to go to taxes, and expected returns on various types of investments. Prioritize your goals, and then weight these priorities by the financial resources needed to meet them. The result is a detailed financial plan that lists your goals, describes ''when'' and ''how'' you expect to meet them, and that is robust to factors beyond your control, such as job loss, unexpected expenses, and market swings. A complete financial plan should address all of the following areas:

===Work, income, and education===

If you are currently working, plan how long you will continue to work. If retirement is a high priority, and your windfall allows you to live off investment income with a [[Safe withdrawal rates|safe withdrawal rate]] (typically 3-4%), then you may be able to retire immediately. If you continue to work, include your expected future income in your financial plan.

The windfall may allow you to change jobs, start your own business, or get additional training that would enable a new career, so consider whether these options are desirable.

===Location===

Decide where you would like to live, and include in your plan costs with moving and living there. Typically the largest financial factors connected to location are available jobs, cost of living (particularly housing), state and local taxes, and proximity to family (which can affect travel and childcare costs). 

Your plan should include a location while working (if appropriate), and while retired. Differences in income tax rates can affect [[Traditional versus Roth|traditional versus Roth]] decisions.

===Spending===

Create a [[Household budgeting|written budget]] that includes allocations for meaningful categories of expense (food, transportation, and so on), and has some cushion for unexpected changes. Everyone needs a budget, no matter how much money they have. 

Include any immediate or planned future purchases, such as replacing an aging car immediately, or when it will reach the end of its life, and include saving for future purchases in the plan.

Consider both the up-front and ongoing costs of purchases. For example, windfall recipients often ignore the ongoing costs associated with expensive properties (property tax, maintenance, utilities, cleaning) or vehicles (fuel, insurance, maintenance, storage for the winter, and so on), which can be substantial.

Resist the temptation to spend a significant portion of a windfall on short-term consumption spending. The enjoyment you will get from investing and spending the windfall over a long period of time, and the comfort from having financial security, will likely far outweigh that from any consumer purchases.

===Accounts===

Understand the different types of tax-advantaged accounts available to you ([[401(k)]], [[IRA]], [[HSA]], [[529 plan]], [[Defined benefit pension plan]], and so on) and plan on using those that give you the greatest advantage. 

[[Variable Annuity|Variable annuities (VAs)]] are usually high-fee products marketed by commissioned salespeople, which are inferior to tax-advantaged accounts and [[Taxable account|taxable accounts]] and are best avoided. However, ''low-cost'' VAs can make sense for some windfall recipients. If you receive a large lump sum windfall that cannot be [[IRA rollovers and transfers|rolled over]] into an [[IRA]], and you intend to invest in [[Tax-efficient fund placement|tax-inefficient investments]], a low-cost VA will allow you to defer taxes on interest, dividends, and capital gains. The tax deferral ''may'' offset the VA fees, which are around 0.25%/year for a good low-cost VA, such as from [https://www.fidelity.com/annuities/FPRA-variable-annuity/overview Fidelity]. If you think a low-cost VA may be appropriate, consult with a third party fee-only financial advisor, who can help make sure the VA you are considering is well-suited for you and not fee-laden. See also: [[Non-deductible_traditional_IRA#Comparison_between_non-deductible_tIRA_and_taxable_accounts|performance comparison between non-deductible IRAs and taxable accounts]] (non-deductible IRAs have the same tax structure as VAs). 

Make sure any withdrawal restrictions (for example, penalties for non-qualified withdrawals from a 401(k) or IRA before age 59½) fit into your overall financial plan.

===Investments===
{{Notice|For further help on creating an investment portfolio, see:
*[[Bogleheads® investment philosophy]]: Explains the basic principles advocated by this site.
*[[Asset allocation]]: Explains the process of dividing an investment portfolio among different asset categories depending on need, ability and willingness to take risk.
*[[Three-fund portfolio]]: Explains a simple portfolio popular with many of this site's members.
*[[Lazy portfolios]]: Contains a number of widely diversified example portfolios.}}

Investing capital, and earning a good rate of return for an appropriate level of risk, is an essential part of almost all financial plans. Which investments are appropriate depends strongly on the time horizon of the goal you are saving for. For example:
* Short-term goals, within the next 3 years. Save using low-risk and low-volatility investments, such as savings accounts, [[Money markets|money market]] accounts or funds, [[Certificate of deposit|certificates of deposit (CDs)]], or short-term bonds. 
* Medium-term goals, in the 3-10 year range. Save with slightly more volatile investments, such as intermediate-term [[Bond basics|bonds]], and could include a small percentage of [[Stock basics|stocks]].
* Long-term goals, 10 or more years away. These can contain a large percentage of higher-volatility higher-return investments like [[Stock basics|stocks]] and real estate. 

Other key factors for choosing investments are need and willingness to take risk, and the consequences of falling short. See [[Asset allocation|asset allocation]] for a more detailed discussion.

You should generally purchase stock and bond investments through [[Index fund|low-cost passive mutual funds]] for [[Diversification|diversification]], [[Expense ratios|reduced costs]], and higher [[Tax-efficient fund placement|tax efficiency in a taxable account]]. Avoid purchasing individual stocks, due to the high volatility and risk of permanent loss.

You should be especially cautious with high-risk investments (for example, private equity, and startup companies) that have a significant possibility of a total loss. Most windfall recipients do not have the necessary experience to properly evaluate high-risk investments, and also do not have the need for higher than market returns. Windfall recipients are also often the targets of bad investments or scams; to reduce this risk, limit investments to diversified funds from respectable institutions.

Once you have made your investment decisions you should formalize them in an [[Investment policy statement]] (IPS) or [[Investment Policy Statement#Investing plan | investment plan]].

===Debts===
{{Main|Prioritizing investments}}

All financial plans should include a list of all current debts and a plan to pay them off. Quickly pay off medium- and high-interest debts, such as credit card debts. See also: [[Paying down loans versus investing]].

You should probably prioritize eliminating all debts, even low-interest ones, because the balance versus investing favors paying down debts more strongly than for more normal investors, for these reasons:
* Money put toward debt cannot later be inappropriately spent, or lost to bad investments or [[Asset protection|civil judgments]]. Historically, these have been common ways windfall recipients have squandered their fortunes.
* Once a debt is paid off, cash flow improves as a required monthly payment is eliminated. This is especially valuable when the windfall is a lump sum.
* The most common reason to invest instead of paying down a debt is the possibility for a higher return than the debt's interest cost. However, most windfall recipients are investment novices who are less likely to reliably generate high returns from their investments. This makes the protection of principal plus guaranteed "return" of paying down a debt more attractive in comparison.
* Windfall recipients have less ''need'' to earn a high return, so the guaranteed "return" of paying off debts is more likely to be adequate.

Similarly, you should avoid taking on new debts (for example, a large mortgage on an expensive new home), because servicing that debt will require good financial behavior over a much longer period of time, with many more opportunities for mistakes.

===Taxes===
{{Main|Tax basics}}

Because the US income tax code is [[Progressive tax|progressive]], taxes become a more important element of financial planning with larger income and assets. You will generally be able to reduce lifetime taxes with some basic tax planning. Common legal methods of reducing taxes include:
* Optimally timing the exercise of incentive stock options, sale of stock, etc. 
* If applicable, appropriate choice of a lump-sum or periodic payment
* Maximizing use of tax-advantaged accounts
* Appropriate choice of [[Traditional versus Roth|traditional versus Roth]] tax structures
* Investing in [[Municipal bonds|municipal bonds]] and/or [[Tax-managed fund comparison|tax-managed funds]] if the expected after-tax return is higher than standard investments
* Taking advantage of [[Step-up in basis|step-up in basis]] and [[Donating appreciated securities|donating appreciated shares to charity]]
* [[Tax loss harvesting]] and, if appropriate [[Tax gain harvesting|tax gain harvesting]]
* [[Tax-efficient fund placement]]
* Appropriately-timed [[Roth IRA conversion|Roth conversions]]
* Relocating to a low-tax or tax-free state, especially when withdrawing from tax-deferred accounts.

Avoid tax evasion schemes, including IRS listed transactions and offshore tax shelters, because these have a high risk of legal problems and IRS levies. Many scams are marketed as tax shelters too. You should not need to take on these high risks in order to meet your financial goals. 

===Insurance===
{{Main|Insurance}}

As your assets increase, most financial experts recommend that you increase your liability insurance limits. Large assets, especially if others know or can find out, make you a more attractive target for lawsuits, so more protection is warranted. High limits on the liability portions of renters', homeowner's, and auto policies are the best place to start. For more coverage, [[Umbrella insurance|umbrella insurance]] provides millions of dollars of additional liability coverage, which stacks on top of other policies. 

More assets mean that insurance deductibles can be raised. There is no need to pay higher premiums on a $250 or $500 deductible when a large reserve of assets can cover a $1,000 or $2,500 payment. 

Reconsider the need for life insurance and disability insurance. If your heirs would be able to sustain an acceptable standard of living on the assets you have, you do not need life insurance. Likewise, if you could maintain a decent standard of living for yourself and your family on your assets with no income, you do not need disability insurance. Canceling these policies will save premium costs.

[[Long-term care insurance]] is not necessary if the windfall allows you to self-insure against the risk.

Permanent life insurance (including whole life, cash value life, indexed universal life, and others) is a hybrid insurance/investing financial product often marketed to high net worth individuals. In reality, the products have high fees and low liquidity, and are not ideal for either life insurance or investing; they are only appropriate for very rare situations. It is probably best to simply avoid permanent life insurance, but if you think it would be appropriate, get a second opinion from a third party fee-only financial advisor (preferably a fiduciary CFP or CFA advisor), and shop around from several insurance companies to make sure you get the best deal.

If you have put off buying any essential insurance (health and liability, and [[Homeowner's insurance|homeowner's]], [[Professional insurance|professional/malpractice]], life or disability if appropriate), take this opportunity to fix this part of your financial picture.

===Emergency funds===
{{Main|Emergency fund}}

Once you get out of debt, you should create an emergency fund that covers about 6 months of living expenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Miriam Caldwell| date=February 1, 2019| 
 url=https://www.thebalance.com/what-should-i-do-with-a-sudden-windfall-2385942|title=What to Do With a Sudden Windfall?| publisher=the balance| access-date=May 30, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Deposit insurance|Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)]] insures bank accounts up to $250,000. If you are going to keep more than this amount in a bank account, consider dividing it among several accounts to keep your balance under this limit.

===Asset protection===
{{Main|Asset protection}}

Asset protection seeks to protect assets from potential creditor claims. For the majority of high net worth individuals, simple and inexpensive asset protection techniques and good financial behaviors in general will provide more than adequate protection:
* Keep comprehensive liability insurance with high limits
* Maximize use of tax-advantaged accounts
* Pay off debts, and especially your mortgage if home equity is protected from creditors in your state
* Avoid activities likely to create liability (risky driving habits, keeping dangerous dog breeds, letting your teenager's friends borrow your boat, and so on)
* Minimize spending on flashy, expensive items that advertise your wealth
* [[Asset titling in the United States|Title joint assets]] as Tenants of the Entirety (in states where allowed)
* Keep potentially liability-generating assets, such as rental properties, inside a Limited Liability Corporation (LLC)
* Divorce is the most common cause of loss of assets, so choose a spouse that shares your values, and invest the time and energy into the relationship necessary to keep it healthy. Consider whether a pre-nuptial or post-nuptial agreement is appropriate for your situation; they often are when there is a significant disparity in assets, or when a spouse has children from a prior relationship.

More complex and expensive asset protection techniques, such as offshore trusts, cost tens of thousands of dollars to set up, and thousands of dollars per year to maintain. They are also far from iron-clad, and even their proponents concede that they are intended to only dissuade potential lawsuits rather than provide reliable protection. The cost/benefit trade-off is not favorable for most people.

===Giving===

Charitable giving can be a meaningful part of a financial plan. Especially if your windfall is large enough to at least cover your basic needs for the rest of your life, strongly consider at least some charitable giving for these reasons:
* It can enrich your life and be incredibly rewarding to help those less fortunate than you
* Giving can change your perspective on your new wealth for the better, and even help teach good financial management behaviors that will make your windfall last much longer. For example, rather than viewing money as something to be hoarded or spent on fleeting pleasures, you can grow to view it as a powerful force that can be applied to create good in your and your family's life, and in your community. Adopting a ''stewardship'' perspective on your windfall will create a positive experience when you give to promote your values, and will also encourage you to preserve and manage your windfall to last a lifetime. 
* Charitable gifts are tax-deductible, so charitable giving can be significantly (although not completely) offset by tax savings.

Consider giving money to family or friends (to whom you would leave assets in your will) during your lifetime, rather than after you die. With life expectancies what they are today, your children could easily be in their 60s or 70s by the time you pass away, many decades past when they would be able to put a gift to the best use. Giving during your lifetime also lets you enjoy seeing the positive effects of those gifts.

While giving to family, friends, and charities can be immensely rewarding, take care of yourself first. While your windfall may seem like more money than you will ever need, progressive tax rates and the need for a low [[Safe withdrawal rates|safe withdrawal rate]] may mean you have far less money available on an ongoing basis than you first imagined. It is okay to give, but prioritize this against other goals and include it in a comprehensive plan.

Carefully consider the effect any gifts or loans to family or friends could have on your relationships. Experience indicates that loans to family and friends often strain relationships, creating stress and resentment on both sides, especially if the loan is not paid back exactly in accordance to the agreement. Giving, rather than lending, is usually a better way to help that minimizes the impact to the relationship, and will also limit your outlay to what you can afford to lose. 

Giving can also damage relationships, especially when the recipient is merely a friend or acquaintance as opposed to close family. After receiving a large gift, the recipient may feel pressure to behave a certain way (for example, spending time with you when it is inconvenient for them), and you may also wonder whether their friendship is predicated on the expectation of gifts, whether it actually is or not.

Be extremely cautious giving or lending money to anyone with severe financial trouble, including close family and friends. Most likely, behavioral finance problems were the dominant cause of the trouble. Unless and until those problems are fixed, they will quickly be back in similar trouble, and any money you gave would likely be wasted on high-interest debts and unnecessary spending. Look for other ways to help, such as hiring them a [[#Get_help|good fee-only financial planner]] or even providing some financial advice yourself using your newly acquired knowledge, if you feel comfortable. Not everyone would be receptive to this type of help, and some people's behavioral finance problems are irreparable, so be prepared to disengage with them on financial topics and provide support in other ways.

===Estate planning===
{{Main|Estate planning}}

Estate planning deals with preparing for your own death and the associated distribution of assets, and also planning for your own incapacity. Although certain elements of estate planning are appropriate for almost every adult, as a general rule estate planning becomes more important with higher levels of assets. For example:

* When you die and leave a large amount of assets to your heirs, you should think carefully about whether they will be able to manage that money without help, and whether they will spend it in a way you would approve of. [[Trusts]] are common in estate planning with higher levels of assets, and allow you to exercise some control over the money you leave to others after you are gone (among many other uses). Trusts can ensure money is professionally managed, only spent for expenses that align with your values, is dolled out in smaller amounts over time, gets more [[Asset protection|protection]] from heirs' potential creditors, and is kept out of heirs' eventual estate for estate taxes. Trusts are almost always appropriate when leaving money to minors or [[Trusts#Spendthrift_trusts|spendthrift]] heirs. Trusts can be written with almost any terms, and should be tailored to your individual situation. 
* If your assets are above the federal [[Estate and inheritance tax|estate tax]] exemption (as of 2025, $13.99&amp;nbsp;million for an individual and $27.98&amp;nbsp;million for a married couple, scheduled to increase to $15/30&amp;nbsp;million in 2026), additional planning is necessary. The federal estate tax is 40% of all assets above the exemption, so can be many millions of dollars for a large estate. Some states also have [[Estate_and_inheritance_tax#State_estate_and_inheritance_taxes|state estate tax]], and the exemption can be as low as $1&amp;nbsp;million. Estate tax planning has two goals: minimize the amount of taxes owed, and streamline the process for paying those taxes. See: [[Estate_planning#Estate_tax_planning_and_avoidance|Estate tax planning and avoidance]] for details.
* Avoiding [[probate]] generally becomes more valuable with higher levels of assets, as probate can have expenses that scale with the size of the estate. It also creates a public record of your assets, which is generally less desirable with higher levels of wealth. The costs and difficulty of probate are state-specific and vary greatly between states. A good estate planning attorney in your state can help you determine wither the benefits for avoiding probate (for example, with a [[Trusts#Revocable_Living_Trusts_(RLTs)|Revocable Living Trust]]) outweigh the downsides for your situation.
* Higher levels of assets increase the importance of having [[Estate_planning#Power_of_Attorney|Powers of Attorney]] in place, as the consequences for having your finances un-managed if you are incapacitated increase. 
* Charitable [[#Giving|giving]] often becomes more important with higher levels of assets. Charitable bequests are not subject to estate taxes.

Estate laws are state-specific, so consult an attorney in your state who specializes in estate planning. A good estate planning attorney will work with you to determine your needs in all these different areas, and create the documents and trusts you need to execute your estate plan.

==Monitor progress and make necessary adjustments==

At least once per year, check your your progress toward your goals, and consider the following checks and adjustments:
* Check your actual spending against your planned budget. The tendency to gradually increase your spending is known as ''lifestyle creep''. If you find your actual spending significantly exceeds your plan, evaluate the reasons why, and either reduce spending on the items that provide the least value, or adjust your financial plan to include higher spending. Raising your spending could delay or prevent you from reaching certain financial goals.
* Monitor the performance of your investments and [[Rebalancing|rebalance]] as necessary. Avoid any temptation to panic-sell either at market highs or lows. [[Bogleheads®_investment_philosophy#Stay_the_course|Stay the course]].
* Stay up-to-date on changes in tax laws, and change tax strategy if necessary.
* Reevaluate your insurance needs, and shop around with other insurance companies to make sure you are getting the lowest rates on policies, especially if your situation has changed significantly. 
* Reevaluate your estate plan. Beneficiaries may need to be changed, new trusts may need to be created, or old trusts may no longer be necessary. Estate tax laws also change frequently, so changes may be needed to avoid taxes.

Avoid the temptation to tinker with your plan and investments unnecessarily. Hot new investments often get covered by the press and on social media, usually after their price has been run up on speculation. Buying into the top of a bubble usually means you will lose a lot of money when the bubble bursts. If you think your investment plan needs a change, it is probably worth a consultation with a fee-only financial advisor.

An '''emergency fund''' is a cash reserve to cover unanticipated needs for cash, such as medical bills, car or home repair, or job loss. It is usually specified as a multiple of monthly expenses, for example, three months to one year's worth of expenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author1=Larry E. Swedroe| author1-link=Larry Swedroe| author2=Kevin Grogan| author3=Tiya Lim| title=The Only Guide You'll Ever Need for the Right Financial Plan: Managing Your Wealth, Risk, and Investments| publisher=Bloomberg Press| edition=1| date=August 2, 2010| page=18| isbn=978-1-57660-366-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

An emergency fund aims to give you a cushion of [http://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidity.asp liquidity] to cover unexpected expenses or becoming unemployed and losing your regular income. Keep your emergency funds in a highly liquid, low risk vehicle; for example, a [[money market]] fund or a bank savings account.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;See: {{cite journal| author1=Johnson, D. P.| author2=Widdows, R.| date=1985| title=Emergency fund levels of households| editor=K. P. Schnittgrund| journal=Proceedings of the 31st Annual Conference of the American Council of Consumer Interests| pages=235-241}} &lt;br&gt; In this paper, the authors define emergency funds as "financial holdings which are available to cover spending in the event of an emergency (income disruption) without drastically adjusting the household’s current level of living." &lt;/ref&gt;

Ideally you build your emergency fund at the same time as taking any employer match to an [[Employer retirement plans overview|employer retirement plan]] (for example, [[401(k)]] or [[403(b)|403b]]) and paying down high-interest-rate debt (such as [[Credit cards|credit card]] debt). Investing for longer range goals, such as retirement, college expenses or a home down payment, comes later. 

== Placement of emergency funds ==
Keep your emergency funds in a highly liquid, easy to access, low risk vehicle with guarantee on the capital. Examples include:
* Checking account
* Money market fund
* (High yield) (insured) savings account
* Reward checking account (RCA), which offers somewhat higher return, if you are willing to put in the effort to set one up.

It might be useful to keep some real cash available for any emergencies where you do not have access to bank accounts.

== Multi-tiered emergency fund ==

By far the most common emergency that would require you to use your emergency fund is the loss of a job. Because you will not need all the funds at once in this case, you might have multiple tiers of emergency fund so that you can place funds not needed for several months in short-term bonds (including [[CD]]s) to earn higher yield.

Those investment products include very short-term [[Treasury bill|treasury bills]], as well as [[CD]]s, which often have an option allowing you to cash them in at any time for a small penalty. You can cash in [[I savings bonds | I bonds]] at no cost after a period, so these can also form a part of a second tier of emergency fund.

For instance, a multi-tiered emergency fund could consist of:
* Three months of expenses in cash (bank account or money market fund)
* The next three months of expenses in CDs with the option to cash them in for three months of interest
* The next three months of expenses in a short-term Treasury bond fund. Selling these would [[Bonds: advanced topics#Duration| risk incurring some loss of principal]] due to interest rate changes, but because the odds of needing to rely on your emergency fund for more than six months are slim, you might consider this an acceptable compromise.&lt;ref group="note"&gt; Johnson &amp; Widdows define three levels of potential emergency fund assets:
#''Quick'' — assets held in savings, checking and money market accounts.
#''Intermediate'' — quick assets plus CDs and savings certificates.
#''Comprehensive'' — intermediate assets plus the value of stocks and bonds.&lt;/ref&gt;

==A note on unemployment benefits==

The most common emergency is job loss. In the United States, many workers who are laid off are eligible for unemployment insurance payments. Eligibility and the size of the benefit vary by state. An important part of your planning should be to find out the rules in your state, and try to determine if you would be eligible, and what the size of the benefit would be.

As a rough guide, unemployment benefit could be about 50% of salary, up to a maximum of about $500 per week, for a maximum of six months. This implies that for many people, unemployment insurance could serve as part as an "emergency fund," with a value of over $10,000.

== Cash emergency fund vs line of credit ==

Some people view various forms of credit, particularly a [[Wikipedia:Home equity line of credit|Home equity line of credit]] (HELOC), as suitable for emergency funds; others strongly disagree. You can often withdraw credit lines with little or no notice, and some emergencies which require you to draw on the emergency fund may also cause a creditor to question your ability to repay.

==Roth IRA as an emergency fund==
{{Main|Roth IRA as an emergency fund}}
In some situations, you can use a [[Roth IRA]] as an emergency fund. You can withdraw contributions (that is, the money that you put into your Roth) at any time, and without taxes and penalties. This is not true of &lt;u&gt;earnings&lt;/u&gt; on your contributions, which are subject to more complex rules.

You can also withdraw penalty-free (but not tax-free) from a traditional IRA for certain excepted emergencies and major life events.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;For more, see [https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-publication-590-b IRS Publication 590-B]. For an easy-to-understand guide of the IRS's Roth IRA withdrawal regulations, see: [http://www.obliviousinvestor.com/roth-ira-withdrawal-rules/ Roth IRA Withdrawal Rules], by forum member ObliviousInvestor. and the [http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i5329.pdf Instructions for Form 5329].&lt;/ref&gt;

A Roth IRA is designed for retirement, not to store emergency funds. You should consider the effect using it as an emergency fund might have on your portfolio asset allocations, and also any custodial costs. There are also behavioral considerations.

If you need to make a choice between funding a Roth IRA and an emergency fund, you can use a Roth IRA as an emergency fund, but only ''in the appropriate situation''.&lt;ref&gt;For details, see {{forum link| t=45554| title=Should an Emergency Fund be in a Roth}}. If unsure, please ask for guidance - this is use of a retirement account for a different purpose.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, remember that funds in investment accounts (Roth IRA) are not immediately available. Check with the fund provider, as you may need several days to complete the fund transfer process.

==Health savings account as an emergency fund==
You can use a [[Health savings account|Health Savings Account]] (HSA) to pay for unexpected medical expenses tax-free, as long as they are qualified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p969.pdf| title=IRS Publication 969, Health Savings Accounts and Other Tax-Favored Health Plans| publisher=IRS| accessdate=June 6, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; Normally, non-medical (and unqualified medical) distributions from an HSA would be taxed as income and assessed an additional 20% penalty.

However, if medical expenses are qualified, incurred since the establishment of the HSA, paid out of pocket, and appropriately documented, they can be reimbursed in a future year. So you can keep a running tally of reimbursable expenses, allowing tax-free withdrawals along the same lines as Roth IRA contributions.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;This article's [[Talk:Emergency fund#Reader feedback: Use of an HSA as an emergency fund|Talk tab]] contains the complete details - including the relevant text from IRS Revenue Bulletin 2004-33 which states:
:"...a distribution from an HSA in the current year can be used to pay or reimburse expenses incurred in any prior year as long as the expenses were incurred after the HSA was established."&lt;/ref&gt;

Notice however that this strategy puts the shorter-term need for liquid, low-risk emergency funds in opposition to the longer-term tax savings of appreciated assets in the HSA. If you consider only part of the HSA to be emergency fund, the two parts (emergency fund and long-term growth) of the HSA should have different asset allocations, and you should track them carefully.

As with using Roth IRA contributions for emergencies, any withdrawals would permanently reduce your tax-advantaged 'space'. For that reason, and because HSA funds might not be available as quickly as bank accounts, you should probably consider HSA funds a 'later tier' of the total emergency fund. 

===Additional considerations===
If you are applying for financial aid for college or grad school, the FAFSA® (Free Application for Federal Student Aid) form excludes HSAs from income.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The balance in the account does not count as an asset, nor would distributions from it count as untaxed income when you use them for qualified medical expenses. Distributions not used for qualified expenses are subject to income tax (and a possible penalty) and will count as adjusted gross income.

      <text bytes="14150" sha1="f6nwviz9sxqavu6tplwpp33zy8d7x39" xml:space="preserve">An '''{{PAGENAME}} (IPS)''' is a statement that defines your general investment goals and objectives. It describes the strategies that you will use to meet these objectives, and contains specific information on subjects such as [[asset allocation]], [[risk]] tolerance, and liquidity requirements.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;For an interactive course on creating an investment policy statement, see: {{cite web| url=https://classroom.morningstar.com/classroom/investing/collection/portfolios/level/100/course/MORN-C870425758?page=1| title=Creating Your Investment Policy Statement| publisher=Morningstar's Investing Classroom| accessdate=June 5, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, you could consider using a simpler ''investing plan'' (see [[#Investing plan |below]]):
*If you find creating a full Investment Policy Statement too complex
*If your investment objectives do not justify the effort needed to create an Investment Policy Statement

== Benefits of using an IPS ==
Every investor could potentially benefit from having an investment policy statement. It provides the foundation for all your future investment decisions. It serves as a guidepost, identifies goals and creates a systematic review process. The IPS aims to keep you focused on your objectives during short-term swings in the market, and gives you a baseline from which to monitor investment performance of your overall portfolio, as well as the performance of individual fund managers.

If you are using some sort of financial advisor, an IPS outlines the ground rules of the relationship between you and that advisor. And you can use the IPS as a reference to see whether or not your portfolio is achieving your stated goals and objectives. You can also use your IPS to evaluate and review any proposed changes to your investments against your overall objectives.

A properly constructed Investment Policy Statement supports following a well-conceived, long-term investment discipline, rather than one that is based on false overconfidence or panic in reaction to short-term market fluctuations.

== Drawbacks of not using an IPS ==
Someone without a written policy often bases decisions on day-to-day events, which regularly leads to chasing short-term performance that may hinder them in reaching long-term goals. Having a policy encourages you to maintain focus on the long-term nature of investing, especially during turbulent or exuberant times.

== Basic sections of an IPS ==
=== Financial account information ===
This area includes:
* Where are your financial assets located?
* How much is in tax-advantaged accounts ([[IRA]], [[Roth IRA]], [[401(k)]], etc) versus taxable accounts?
* How much will you be contributing to these accounts?

=== Investment objectives, time horizon, and risk tolerance ===
Here you list the following:
* Your short-term financial goals and liquidity needs
* Your long-term financial goals and retirement
** Your time-frame for funding these goals
** The length of time for which you will need these assets
** Amount of assets required

=== Asset classes to use and those to avoid ===
For example:
* [[Asset class]]es you decide that you must include in your overall investment portfolio
** U.S. Stocks
** International Stocks
** U.S. Bonds
* Asset classes you would rather avoid due to excessive risk, high expenses, or large tax liabilities, and so on. For example:
** Hedge funds
** Actively-managed funds with high taxable turnover or distributions
** Consider under-weighting tech sector due to my employment there

=== Asset allocation targets and rebalancing ranges ===
This area lists the following:
* Your target allocation between [[stock]]s and [[bond]]s
* Your target allocation for international investments
* Any time-frame for altering these allocations
* The minimum and maximum deviations from these targets that will trigger portfolio [[rebalancing]]

=== Monitoring and control procedures ===
Here you list:
* Your frequency of monitoring
* Your benchmark for comparison of portfolio returns
* The acceptable deviation from benchmark (amount and time)
* Any concrete procedures for future changes to IPS, for example:
** Financial reasons for changing IPS
** Lifestyle reasons for changing IPS
** Any reasons ''not'' to change IPS (for example, short-term market performance)

! style="text-align:left;" | Investment objectives:
|These are my main objectives for my investment program. I have developed them after a review of my financial resources, financial goals, asset allocation, risk tolerance and time horizon.
* Objective 1: To retire at the age of 57
* Objective 2: To have an annual income from my investments of at least $45,000 after taxes and in today’s dollars (inflation assumed to be 3.0 percent yearly)
* Objective 3: To leave a meaningful inheritance for my children
* Objective 4: To minimize potential tax liabilities
* Objective 5: To monitor portfolio allocation against holding limits, to benchmark returns against expectations, and to consider revisions to portfolio as personal situation may dictate
|-
! style="text-align:left;" | Risk tolerance:
|My ability to tolerate the uncertainties, complexities and volatility inherent in the investment markets has been considered in the development of this investment program. The main factors that have influenced my risk tolerance and asset allocation are: age, present financial condition, specific financial goals, discretionary income and its variability, past investment experience.

|Based on my financial resources, financial goals, time horizon, tax status, holding limitations, risk tolerance and [[Historical and Expected Returns| expected investment performance]] a recommended portfolio was determined. The portfolio balances risk and reward and attempts to achieve the stated objectives of the investment program. The initial asset allocation is:
* Large Cap U.S. Equities (25 percent)
* Mid Cap U.S. Equities (10 percent)
* Small Cap U.S. Equities (5 percent)
* Foreign Equities (15 percent)
* REITs (10 percent)

|Investment portfolios used to implement the investment program shall be subject to specified selection criteria and shall be monitored for adherence to my investment policy guidelines, major changes in the portfolios and comparative performance with similar investments. The [[Expense ratios |expense ratio]] and overall cost of funds shall be a major point in the selection criteria. To minimize style drift, index funds are preferred, if available, for all asset class.
|-
! style="text-align:left;" | Review process:
|My investment performance will be monitored and reported on a quarterly basis and will be compared against the appropriate benchmarks. The investment program will be reviewed at least annually to make sure that it continues to achieve his stated objectives. Since this investment program is long-term in nature, the periodic adjustments made to his investment program should be small.

|The percentage weighting to each asset class within the investment portfolio will vary. The percentage weighting within each asset class will be allowed to vary within a reasonable range of plus or minus an absolute 5 percent or 25 percent of the original allocation amount; whichever is triggered first. To minimize taxable events when rebalancing is required, dividends and net cash inflows will be used to meet the strategic asset allocation targets. If cash flow is not sufficient to meet the target allocation for an asset class, I will decide whether to effect transactions in order to rebalance the asset allocation.

Fellow Boglehead [https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=681 Sunny] was one of the first to post a popular IPS. It may not cover all of the topics necessary for someone with a complicated financial situation, but his IPS is brilliant in its elegance and compactness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://socialize.morningstar.com/NewSocialize/asp/FullConv.asp?forumId=F100000015&amp;convId=183427| title=Diehard Sunny Sarkar's beautiful IPS| author=Taylor Larimore| author-link=Taylor Larimore| date=September 18, 2006| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220621234414/https://socialize.morningstar.com/NewSocialize/asp/FullConv.asp?forumId=F100000015&amp;convId=183427| archive-date=June 21, 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investing plan==
In some cases, a ''formal'' investing policy statement may seem too complicated or inconvenient. In that case, you could develop an informal ''investing plan'' (also referred to as an ''investment plan'') instead. Whether it is called a policy or a plan, the idea is that you have a clear understanding of managing your investment goals and objectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Forum link| t=69802| title=EmergDoc's Investing Plan Thread}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bogleheads forum often gets questions such as "I have $50K saved up and I need to know which funds to put it in!". Setting up an investing plan will help answer these questions.

An investing plan can be as easy as following these simple steps:
*''Step 1'' - Formulate your goals. Be as specific as possible, realizing that you will make changes as the years go by.
*''Step 2'' - Set up a plan for each goal. The plan consists of identifying what type of account you will use to save the money, choosing the amount you will put toward the goal each year, working out an asset allocation likely to reach the goal with the minimum risk necessary, and identifying a plan B for the goal in case the returns you are planning on do not materialize.
*''Step 3'' - Select the best (usually lowest cost) investments to fulfill your desired asset allocation. Using all or mostly index funds further simplifies the process.

Some typical goals that can benefit from an investing plan:
*I want $40,000 for home downpayment by June 30, 2030
*I want to have enough money to pay the tuition at my alma mater in 13 years when my 5 year old turns 18
*I want to have $2&amp;nbsp;million saved for retirement by Jan 1 2050

      <text bytes="10260" sha1="2q28kx47v2ei5pn0tvnv4a47301qn3z" xml:space="preserve">'''{{PAGENAME}}''' brings a [[portfolio]] that has deviated away from its target [[asset allocation]] back into line. The idea is that maintaining a consistent mix of [[asset class]]es (most commonly [[equities]] and [[fixed income]]) will help to keep risk at the desired level.

You do this by transferring funds from higher-performing classes to lower-performing classes. Although this may seem counterintuitive, rebalancing ensures that investors "Buy Low" and "Sell High".

==Example==
* You own two funds (Fund A and Fund B). The funds could be either [[mutual fund]]s, [[index fund]]s or [[exchange-traded fund]]s (ETFs).
* You have a $10,000 portfolio and have selected an asset allocation such that each fund represents 50% of the total ($5,000 each)
* Over time, Fund A rises in value to $6000 while Fund B declines in value to $4,000 - you now have a 60/40 split instead of 50/50
* To maintain your asset allocation, you would rebalance your portfolio by taking $1,000 from Fund A and transferring it to Fund B
* After this, your asset allocation is once again 50/50

==Different rebalancing approaches==
There are several ways you can determine when it is time to rebalance:
* At a certain point in the calendar (for example, the beginning of the year, a specific day of the year, every other year, and so on). For example, you might systematically rebalance your portfolio once a year, on your birthday.
* When asset classes deviate from their target by a specific ''absolute percentage''. For example, if your target asset allocation is 60% equities and 40% fixed income and your (absolute) rebalancing threshold is +/-&amp;nbsp;5%, you would rebalance your portfolio when your portfolio reaches (65% equities / 35% fixed income) or (55% equities / 45% fixed income).&lt;ref group="note" name="5/25"&gt;[[Larry Swedroe]] uses a "5/25 rule" which works like this:
*'''Absolute percentage of 5% for allocations 20% or greater:''' When asset classes deviate from their target by an ''absolute'' percentage of 5%. For example, if your target asset allocation is 60% equities and 40% fixed income, you would rebalance your portfolio when your portfolio reaches (65% equities / 35% fixed income) or (55% equities / 45% fixed income).
*'''Relative percentage of 25% for allocations less than 20%:''' When asset classes deviate from their target by a ''relative'' percentage of 25%. For example, if your target equities asset allocation is 60%, composed of 45% Total Stock Market and 15% Total International, you would rebalance Total International if it changes by more than +/-&amp;nbsp;3.75% (25% of 15%).

* When asset classes deviate from their target by a certain ''relative percentage''. For example, if your target equities asset allocation is 60%, composed of 40% Total Stock Market and 20% Total International, and your (relative) rebalancing threshold is +/-&amp;nbsp;25%, you would rebalance International if it changes by more than +/- 5% (25% of 20%).&lt;ref group="note" name="5/25" /&gt;
* When asset classes deviate from their target by a certain dollar amount. For example, if you hold $6,000 in equities and $4,000 in fixed income and your rebalancing threshold is +/-&amp;nbsp;$1,000, you would rebalance your portfolio when either of your holdings deviates from their target asset allocation of 60% equities / 40% fixed income by at least $1,000.
* When contributing to or withdrawing from your portfolio. For example, if your target allocation is 60% equities and 40% fixed income, you hold $7,000 of equities and $3,000 of fixed income, and you wish to contribute $1,000 to your portfolio, you would simply buy $1,000 worth of fixed income assets. This would bring you to an allocation of 64% equities / 36% fixed income. This approach minimizes transaction costs, effort, and taxes. This [https://optimalrebalancing.info portfolio rebalancing calculator] can help in cases where it is not obvious how much of a new contribution or withdrawal to allocate to each asset.

==Other considerations==
* Think about transaction costs when deciding whether or not to rebalance. Because transactions often have costs associated with them, many investors choose to wait for their portfolio to pass a significant threshold of deviation (whether defined by percentage or dollars) before rebalancing.
* Investors often find it difficult "selling winners" to "buy losers". To help remove emotions from the decision, you might choose a specific date to rebalance (for example, birthday, tax day, and so on). Investors who find the prospect daunting may want to consider [[Vanguard target retirement funds]], which automatically rebalance as necessary to maintain a consistent asset allocation.
* The frequency with which you check your portfolio for deviations from its target has some influence on the returns gains (or losses) that rebalancing generates.&lt;ref group="note" name="frequency"&gt;Research seems to indicate that checking weekly (while actually rebalancing very infrequently, for example by using large deviation thresholds) could provide the best rebalancing bonus. Conversely, rebalancing too frequently and using low thresholds would be detrimental.

==Modified approaches==
If you worry about rebalancing into a sustained bear market, one of these modifications to standard rebalancing methods might be useful:
* Keep a floor level of bonds, that is, once the total amount of bonds has dropped to a fixed amount, stop rebalancing into stocks.
* Only rebalance out of stocks, never into stocks.

==Estimating changes in asset allocation==
Normal market fluctuations do not frequently trigger rebalancing. For example, shifting the balance of a 50/50 portfolio by 1% requires a 4% change in the price of stocks relative to bonds.

All other portfolios are less sensitive, with 70/30 or 30/70 requiring a 5% change, 80/20 or 20/80 a 6% change, and 90/10 or 10/90 an 11% change. For example, a $10,000 60/40 portfolio will, after a 10% stock market drop, have $6,000 * 0.9 = $5,400 in stocks and $4,000 in bonds, for a stock allocation of $5,400 / ($5,400 + $4,000) = 57.45%, a 2.55% shift.

      <text bytes="78927" sha1="d9hyl65jbu5mvubdcyvkawpi0oq2ocj" xml:space="preserve">The relationship between '''risk''' and '''return''' is a fundamental concept in finance theory, and is one of the most important concepts for investors to understand. A widely used definition of investment risk, both in theory and practice, is the uncertainty that an investment will earn its expected rate of return.&lt;ref&gt;Reilly (1994), p.11&lt;/ref&gt; Finance literature uses "return" and "rate of return" interchangeably.

A rational investor will not take more risk without expecting a higher return. Since the early 1950s, an enormous amount of theoretical and empirical research has characterized and quantified the relationship between risk and return.

[[Harry M. Markowitz|Harry Markowitz]] initially developed ''Portfolio Theory'' in the early 1950s. This was the first serious theoretical attempt to quantify the relationship between risk and return. Portfolio Theory often is referred to as ''Modern Portfolio Theory'' or MPT. Portfolio theory characterizes risk as the uncertainty of returns, and uses standard statistical techniques to quantify the relationship between risk and return. These techniques include statistical measures such as ''variance'' and [[standard deviation]] to quantify the uncertainty of returns.

"Uncertainty of returns" includes not only the possibility of loss, but also the possibility of ''positive surprises'' relative to expectations. Because investors typically are more concerned about negative surprises than positive surprises, some theoretical work considers only negative deviations relative to expectations. However, risk as the uncertainty of returns, including positive as well as negative deviations from expectations, is the main risk model used in investing.

[[William F. Sharpe|William Sharpe]] and others extended portfolio theory to develop asset valuation models, such as the [[CAPM - Capital Asset Pricing Model | Capital Asset Pricing Model]], or CAPM. CAPM introduced the idea of combining a risk-free asset with a portfolio of risky assets to construct a complete portfolio that resulted in an efficient trade-off between risk and return. It also gave a more straightforward way to quantify the risk of individual assets, by comparing their returns with the return of a broad market portfolio. CAPM's other important contribution was to clarify the distinction between ''systematic risk'' inherent in investing in risky assets, which cannot be eliminated, and ''unsystematic risk'' specific to individual firms, which diversification can eliminate.

[[Eugene F. Fama|Eugene Fama]], [[Kenneth R. French|Kenneth French]], and others added work to develop more sophisticated models to evaluate risk and return. Although CAPM uses a single "factor" to characterize risk, Fama and French showed that a multifactor model better explains historical returns. Instead of comparing the returns of an asset or portfolio of assets only to a broad market portfolio, they also compared them to portfolios of small-cap stocks and value stocks (technically small minus big or SmB, and high book value minus low book value or HmL). This is the ''Fama-French three-factor model''.

The finance theory in this article outlines some of the theoretical foundations for asset allocation and investing in index mutual funds. It evaluates expected rates of return for various asset classes and compares them to the risk of the asset classes. Investor goals and [[risk tolerance]] determine the trade-off between the expected return and risk of the portfolio. The portfolio combines various lower-risk and higher-risk asset classes to achieve an efficient risk-return trade-off.

Determining risk tolerance is a critical step in designing a portfolio. Several approaches can help investors to assess their risk tolerance.

Both shorter-term risk and longer-term risk are characterized by the uncertainty of returns. Shorter-term risk typically is characterized by the uncertainty of shorter-term returns; for example, monthly or annual returns. Longer-term risk is better characterized by the uncertainty of the cumulative portfolio value (terminal wealth) after many years of investing.

==Risk as the uncertainty of returns==

The rate of return earned on an investment in a 30-day [[Treasury bill]] (T-Bill) or short-term [[Certificate of Deposit]] (CD) has high certainty. T-Bills and CDs are among the investments referred to collectively as [[Money Markets|money market]] securities.&lt;ref&gt;Bodie, Kane, Marcus, 2008, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; A money market fund provides a convenient way for an investor to own money market securities. The short-term return on deposits in federally-insured bank or credit union accounts is also highly certain (the term ''cash'' often is used to refer to money market securities and money in deposit accounts; [[Vanguard]] refers to these types of assets as ''short-term reserves'').

The returns earned by T-Bills, CDs and money market funds fall into a relatively narrow range over longer time periods as well.

[[File:Return Dispersion - T-Bills - T-Bonds - Stocks.jpg|thumb|right|351px|Figure 1. Risk vs. Return: 1928 - 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/histretSP.html| title=Annual Returns on Stock, T.Bonds and T.Bills: 1928 - Current| publisher=Damodaran Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The top chart in Figure 1 is a [[Wikipedia:histogram|histogram]] showing the frequency distribution of returns for 3-month T-Bills from 1928 through 2011. The ''height'' of each bar represents the ''number of years'' in which annual returns have fallen within a given 5% range or "bin" (that is, 0% to 5%, 5% to 10%, etc.). The tallest bar shows that annual returns have been between 0% and 5% in 59 years. Returns have been between 5% and 10% in 22 years (second tallest bar), and between 10% and 15% in three years (shortest bar). 

The return on [[Bond basics|bonds]] is less certain than the return on money market securities, so bonds are considered riskier than money market securities (cash). The middle chart in Figure 1 shows the frequency distribution of annual returns for 10-Year Treasury Bonds from 1928 through 2011 (the same vertical scale for number of years is used in all charts in Figure 1, and the same 5% bins are used on the horizontal axes). Notice that the range of returns is larger, from about -11% to +33%, and that the number of years in which returns fall within any given 5% bin is generally smaller. In other words, the shape of the return distribution is more "spread out" and flatter. The shape of the return distribution represents the ''dispersion of returns'', also referred to as the ''deviation of returns''.

The return on [[Stock basics|stocks]] is more uncertain than the return on bonds, so stocks are considered riskier than bonds. The bottom chart in Figure 1 shows the frequency distribution of annual returns on the stocks of large US companies (the S&amp;P 500) from 1928 through 2011. Note the much larger dispersion of returns; the shape of the distribution is much flatter and more spread out, with returns ranging from about -44% to +53%, and none of the 5% bins including returns for more than 10 years (by contrast, recall that one 5% bin included the T-bill returns for 59 years).

''Standard deviation'' is a measure commonly used to quantify the deviation (or dispersion) of returns. The standard deviation is listed for each chart in Figure 1. The standard deviation increases as the dispersion of returns increases (that is, as the shape of the distribution becomes flatter and more spread out). Standard deviation will be defined in more detail in subsequent sections.

==Risk as the possibility of loss==

The definition of risk as the uncertainty of investment return does not distinguish between loss and gain. Typically, individual investors think of risk as the possibility that their investments could lose money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Rick Ferri| author-link=Rick Ferri| title=All About Asset Allocation| date=2006| page=23| publisher=McGraw-Hill| isbn=978-0071429580}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are likely to be quite happy with an investment return that is greater than expected (a "positive surprise"). However, because risky assets generate positive surprises as well as negative surprises, defining risk as the ''uncertainty'' of the return seems reasonable. Mor uncertainty makes it more likely that the investment will generate gains as well as losses. 

Variance and standard deviation, discussed in detail in subsequent sections, quantify the negative ''and positive'' deviation of returns around the average return (the terms ''average return'', ''mean return'', and ''expected return'' are used interchangeably, as are the terms ''deviation of returns'' and ''dispersion of returns''). Some theoretical portfolio work uses measures that consider only risk of loss; semivariance, which considers only deviations below the average, is one example.

However, because deviation of returns is symmetrical, variance provides as good an indicator of downside risk as semivariance. If returns are symmetrical, the the probabilities and magnitudes of positive and negative surprises are roughly the same. It is reasonable to assume a symmetrical distribution of returns for a well diversified portfolio, and most assets have returns that are reasonably symmetrical.&lt;ref&gt;Elton et al, 2003, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore in portfolio theory, as well as in practice, variance and standard deviation are the most commonly used measures of dispersion of returns. In other words, even though investors may be primarily concerned with negative surprises, investment risk can be adequately estimated with measures that include both positive and negative surprises.

A major concern of investors is that their investment portfolios will not generate returns sufficient to meet their goals. This is "shortfall risk", and deserves serious consideration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author1=Zvi Bodie| author2=Paula H. Hogan| url=https://www.aaii.com/features/jrnl200506p16.pdf| title=For Long-Term Investors, the Focus Should Be on Risk| publisher=AAII Journal| accessdate=October 17, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, using uncertainty of returns can be a valid approach in estimating the riskiness of long-term returns as well as short-term returns, as long as it uses the appropriate variance or standard deviation measures. 

For long-term returns, it is more appropriate to estimate the ''dispersion of accumulated wealth'' (also referred to as ''terminal wealth dispersion'') rather than the deviation of returns over relatively short time periods, such as annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author1=Gary Smith| author2=Donald Gould| url=http://economics-files.pomona.edu/GarySmith/shortfallRisk.pdf| title=Measuring and Controlling Shortfall Risk in Retirement| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190118052301/http://economics-files.pomona.edu/GarySmith/shortfallRisk.pdf| archive-date=January 18, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because relatively small differences in ''annualized'' returns can make large differences in ''cumulative'' returns over periods of many years.&lt;ref&gt;Bodie, Kane, Marcus, 2008, p. 180&lt;/ref&gt; Long-term dispersion of returns accounts for the ''magnitude'' as well as the ''probability'' of possible losses.

=="Risk free" assets==
[[File:Annual US Treasury Bill Yield and Inflation Rate.jpg|thumb|right|351px|Figure 2. Annualized T-Bill yield and inflation rate (1928 - 2011)&lt;ref group="note"&gt;T-bill data source comes from [http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/histretSP.html Annual Returns on Stock, T.Bonds and T.Bills: 1928 - Current], Damodaran Online. Inflation data comes from [https://www.minneapolisfed.org/community/teaching-aids/cpi-calculator-information/consumer-price-index-and-inflation-rates-1913 Consumer Price Index 1913 -, Minnesota Federal Reserve].{{dead link}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Money market securities are often referred to as ''risk-free assets'', especially the shorter-maturity securities such as 30-day T-Bills. This is because the short-term return is known with relative certainty at the time the investment is made. There is absolute certainty in the nominal return of a T-Bill (assuming the U.S. government does not default on its obligations), and it is unlikely that unexpected inflation will have significant impact on the real return over a short time period. 

Over longer time periods, even money market securities have some risk. This is because the effect of unexpected [[Consumer price index|inflation]] on returns is uncertain over longer time periods. Although money market security rates usually respond relatively quickly to changes in inflation, this is not always the case. Figure 2 illustrates the longer-term uncertainty of real returns on 90-day T-Bills. The relative ''certainty'' of return does not mean that the ''real'' return necessarily is ''positive''. It may be known with certainty that a 90-day T-Bill will earn a ''nominal'' annualized return of 1% over its 90-day term (that is, if held to maturity). However if inflation over the 90-day term is expected to be 3% annualized, the relatively certain, expected ''real'' return is -2% annualized.

Uncertainty in ''real'' returns can be eliminated by investing in inflation-indexed securities, such as [[Treasury Inflation Protected Securities]] ([[TIPS]]) and [[I Savings Bonds|Series I Savings Bonds]] ([[I Bonds]]), and holding them to maturity. Of course in return for this reduction in uncertainty, investors must accept lower expected returns. Marketable inflation-indexed securities also have other risks, such as interest rate risk (that is, prices decline when interest rates rise) and liquidity risk, as in late 2008 (September 12 - October 31) when the Vanguard Inflation-Protected Securities fund declined by almost 14%. During this same time period other U.S. treasury securities increased in value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author1=John Y. Campbell| author2=Robert J. Schiller| author3=Luis M.

[As a further reference, this can be seen directly on a price chart like the following: http://www.google.com/finance?chdnp=0&amp;chdd=1&amp;chds=1&amp;chdv=1&amp;chvs=Logarithmic&amp;chdeh=0&amp;chfdeh=0&amp;chdet=1227301200000&amp;chddm=28599&amp;cmpto=MUTF:VFISX;MUTF:VFITX;MUTF:VUSTX&amp;cmptdms=0;0;0&amp;q=MUTF:VIPSX&amp;]{{dead link}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In reality, whether or not an asset is risk free depends on the context of the investment; that is, the purpose and time horizon of the investment. For example, to meet a nominal liability at a specified future date, a zero-coupon US government bond maturing on that date is essentially risk free. 

Nevertheless, short-term T-bills usually are considered to be risk-free assets in portfolio theory, and in practice investors treat a broader range of money market securities as risk free.&lt;ref&gt;Bodie, Kane, Marcus, 1996, p. 173&lt;/ref&gt;

==Risk aversion and risk premiums==

Why would an investor invest in a risky asset class such as stocks rather than in a relatively risk-free asset such as T-bills? If the investor is not simply gambling, there must be some financial incentive, such as the expectation of a higher rate of return. The conclusion is that an investment in a risky asset depends on the investor's expectation of a higher rate of return as well as their level of ''risk aversion''.&lt;ref&gt;Bodie, Kane, Marcus, 2008, p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;

Rational investors are risk averse. That is, given the same expected return, they will choose the investment for which that return is more certain.&lt;ref&gt;Reilly, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, investors demand a higher expected return for riskier assets. A higher ''expected'' return does not guarantee a higher ''realized'' return. Because by definition returns on risky assets are uncertain, an investment may not earn its expected return.

The amount by which a risky asset is expected to provide a higher rate of return than the ''risk-free rate'' is the asset's ''risk premium'' (the risk-free rate is the rate of return on a risk-free asset, such as a T-bill). If the risk premium of stocks is zero, a ''rational'', risk-averse investor would have no incentive to invest in them. On the other hand, a gambler might "invest" in something with a zero or even negative risk premium for entertainment value, or in the irrational expectation of hitting a jackpot.

Although the charts in Figure 1 show historical (realized) returns rather than expected (future) returns, they are useful to demonstrate the relationship between risk and return, and the risk premiums of bonds and stocks relative to the relatively risk-free returns on T-bills. The mean (average) annual return increases as the dispersion of returns (uncertainty or risk) increases. 

Assuming an investor selects an investment portfolio based on expected return and risk, the equation below is used to quantify the relationship between risk premium, risk aversion, A, and risk σ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, where the risk premium is the expected return, E(r), of the risky investment minus the risk-free rate, r&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{Risk} \operatorname{Premium} = \operatorname{E}(r) - r_f = \frac12 A \sigma^2&lt;/math&gt;

In this equation risk is measured by variance, σ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, which quantifies the dispersion of an investment's returns. Variance is discussed in depth in another section. The factor of &lt;span style="font-size:100%"&gt;''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;/span&gt; is a scaling factor used by convention, and the use of this equation requires expressing all returns as decimals rather than percentages.

This equation indicates that the risk premium demanded by investors will be higher for individual investors with greater risk aversion, A, and for investments with higher risk, σ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

Studies have shown that investors' risk aversion probably is in the range of 2-4.&lt;ref&gt;Bodie, Kane, Marcus, 2008, p. 124&lt;/ref&gt; This implies that for an increase of portfolio variance of 0.01, investors will require a risk premium that is higher by 0.01-0.02 (1%-2%).

==Measuring risk: historical returns==
Historical returns often are used as a starting point in estimating expected returns and uncertainty of returns (risk).&lt;ref&gt;Ilmanen, 2011, p.7&lt;/ref&gt; Although evaluating historical returns may not enable an accurate or comprehensive estimation of risk, evaluating the dispersion of historical returns provides a convenient way to develop an understanding of commonly used risk measures.

The risk of an investment is related to the uncertainty of its investment return. This was illustrated graphically in Figure 1, which showed that dispersion of returns is a way to characterize the riskiness of an investment. Many investors like to summarize return and risk with numbers that quantify the average return and the dispersion of returns around the average.&lt;ref&gt;Bodie, Kane, Marcus, 2008, p.121&lt;/ref&gt; This facilitates comparing the return and risk of different investments.&lt;ref&gt;Reilly, p.14&lt;/ref&gt; 

Calculating the average of a set of historical annual returns is straightforward: simply add the annual returns and divide by the number of annual returns. The technical term for this type of average is the ''arithmetic mean'', usually referred to simply as the ''mean''. Statisticians use the term ''expected value'' to refer to the mean. In finance theory the term ''expected value of the return'', or just ''expected return'' is commonly used in referring to the average of a set of returns.&lt;ref&gt;Elton et al (2003), p.45&lt;/ref&gt;

What about calculating a number to quantify the uncertainty or dispersion of returns? Basic statistics and probability theory provide two measures to quantify the dispersion of a set of numbers: ''variance'' and ''standard deviation''. Starting in the early 1950s, finance academics began using these statistical measures to quantify risk.&lt;ref&gt;Markowitz, Harry (March 1952). [http://www.math.ust.hk/~maykwok/courses/ma362/07F/markowitz_JF.pdf "Portfolio Selection"]. ''The Journal of Finance'' 7 (1): 77-91. Retrieved April 12, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historical returns are commonly used as a starting point in evaluating the relative riskiness of different assets. A subset of the historical data shown graphically in Figure 1 provides a simple example to begin developing an understanding of standard deviation as a measure of risk.

Consider the S&amp;P 500 stock returns for 2008-2011: 

*2008: -36.55%
*2009: +25.94%
*2010: +14.82%
*2011: +2.07%

The mean, or expected value, E(r), of this set of returns is calculated below (for simplicity, the percent signs are dropped):

: &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{E}(r) = \frac{-36.55 + 25.94 + 14.82 + 2.07}{4} = 1.57 &lt;/math&gt;

The expected value of the annual return is 1.57%.

An alternate way to calculate expected value is to multiply each value by the probability of that value occurring, then sum the results. This formulation will be useful when calculating the expected value of estimated future returns. When evaluating historical returns, each return is considered to have equal probability, so the calculation using this method is:

: &lt;math&gt;
 \operatorname{E}(r) = \frac 14(-36.55)+\frac{1}{4}(25.94)+\frac{1}{4}(14.82) + \frac{1}{4}(2.07) = 1.57
 &lt;/math&gt;

The average of the annual returns is useful information, but it does not indicate anything about the dispersion of returns, that is, how the returns are distributed around the mean return.

It is intuitive that a useful measure of dispersion of returns around the average return would involve calculating the differences (deviations) between the individual returns and the average return, and perhaps averaging these deviations. For example the deviation for the 2009 return is 25.94 - 1.57 = 24.37, whereas the deviation for the much smaller 2011 return is only 2.07 - 1.57 = 0.50.

The problem with this is that there will be both positive and negative deviations that will tend to cancel each other out, resulting in a misleading value that understates the dispersion of returns around the mean; in fact, the average of the deviations from the mean will always be zero.&lt;ref&gt;Bodie, Kane, Marcus, 2008, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt; This can be verified by calculating the average of the deviations from the mean for all four years in the example. Therefore, this value indicates nothing about dispersion.

This problem is resolved by ''squaring'' the deviations from the mean (which results in all positive numbers), then calculating the average of the squared deviations. The term ''variance'' is used to describe the average of the squared deviations. Here is the calculation of the variance of the annual returns using the returns from 2008-2011:

: &lt;math&gt;
 \operatorname{Var}(r) = \sigma^2 = \frac{ (-36.55-1.57)^2+(25.94-1.57)^2+(14.82 - 1.57)^2+(2.07-1.57)^2 } {4} = 556
 &lt;/math&gt;

The symbol &amp;sigma;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; commonly represents variance, so Var(r) = &amp;sigma;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 556.

This formula can be generalized as:

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Var}(r) = \sigma^2 = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n (r_i - \operatorname{E}(r))^2&lt;/math&gt;

(When calculating the variance of a ''sample'' of the full population of values (as in the example here), statisticians often substitute &lt;span style="font-size:100%"&gt;''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;(n-1)&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;/span&gt; for &lt;span style="font-size:100%"&gt;''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;/span&gt; in the above formula. There are arguments for and against this.&lt;ref&gt;Elton et al (2003), p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; In this article this substitution will not be made.)

To get a value with the same units as the rate of return (percent), the square root of the variance is calculated, resulting in the ''standard deviation'' of the annual returns:

: &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{SD}(r) = \sigma = \sqrt{556} = 23.6 &lt;/math&gt;

The symbol &amp;sigma; commonly represents standard deviation, so SD(r) = &amp;sigma; = 23.6 pp (technically, the units of the standard deviation of returns are percentage points (pp), but standard deviation of returns often is displayed using the % symbol, for example, 23.6%).

The resulting value of 23.6 pp (or 23.6%) for the standard deviation seems somewhat reasonable as an indicator of the dispersion of returns around the mean value of 1.57%, considering that the range of values is between -36.55% and +25.94%.

Standard deviation has some standard statistical interpretations for a large number of values with a normal distribution (the ubiquitous bell curve). For example, about 68% of all values fall within +/- one standard deviation, and about 95% of all values fall within +/- two standard deviations. 

There are too few values in our simple example for these statistical attributes to apply, but consider the 84 annual returns for 10-Year treasury bonds represented in the second chart in Figure 1.

First notice that the data somewhat resembles the bell-shape curve characteristic of a normal distribution. The mean value of the 84 annual returns for 10-Year treasury bonds is about 5%, and the standard deviation is about 8% (pp). Two standard deviations is about 2 x 8 = 16, so we expect most of the annual returns to fall within the range of about 5% +/- 16 pp or between about -11% and +21%. From the chart, this looks about right.

For the third chart in Figure 1, representing 84 annual returns for the stocks in the S&amp;P 500, the mean is about 11% and the standard deviation is about 20%, so we expect most values to fall within a range of about 11% +/- 40 pp, or between about -29% and + 51%. Again, this looks about right.

Rather than calculating the standard deviation of annual returns, the annualized standard deviation of ''monthly'' returns sometimes is used to characterize dispersion of returns. For example, Morningstar calculates the standard deviation of monthly returns over various time periods of one year or more (for example, three years, five years, and so on), then multiplies by the square root of twelve to generate an estimate of the annualized standard deviation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| publisher=Morningstar| date=2005| url=http://corporate.morningstar.com/us/documents/MethodologyDocuments/MethodologyPapers/StandardDeviationSharpeRatio_Definition.pdf| title=Standard Deviation and Sharpe Ratio Methodology| accessdate=August 10, 2012}}{{dead link}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Expected return==

Although in finance theory, ''expected return'' is a synonym for the average of a set of returns, in investing, ''expected return'' more often refers to ''future'' returns than to ''historical'' returns. From here on this will be the context in which the term is used. In this context, ''expected return'' can be thought of informally as the return investors expect to receive on an investment. Indeed, the term often is used this way by authors of investment books (as seems to be the case, for example, in ''Expected Returns'' by Ilmanen.&lt;ref&gt;Ilmanen, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;) However, in investment theory ''expected return'' has a more precise definition.

An investment's expected return, &lt;span style="font-size:100%"&gt;E(''r'')&lt;/span&gt;, is calculated as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Bodie, Kane, Marcus, 2008, p. 112&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reilly, pp. 11-13&lt;/ref&gt;

# Various economic scenarios, &lt;span style="font-size:100%"&gt;''s''&lt;/span&gt;, are defined.
# Estimates are developed for the probability, &lt;span style="font-size:100%"&gt;p(''s'')&lt;/span&gt;, of each scenario occurring and the return, &lt;span style="font-size:100%"&gt;r(''s'')&lt;/span&gt;, for that scenario. 
# The probability and return for each scenario are multiplied together: &lt;span style="font-size:100%"&gt;p(''s'')&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:100%"&gt;r(''s'')&lt;/span&gt;
# The results are summed across all scenarios: &lt;span style="font-size:100%"&gt;p(''s&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'')r(''s&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'') + p(''s&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'')r(''s&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'') + &amp;hellip; + p(''s&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'')r(''s&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'')&lt;/span&gt;

Or using summation notation:

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}(r) = \sum_{i=1}^n \operatorname{p}(s_i)\operatorname{r}(s_i)&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, expected return is the ''probability-weighted average of returns across all possible scenarios''.

First consider an investment in a 1-year T-Bill. Since the nominal return is unaffected by economic factors, the nominal return is certain; that is, the probability, &lt;span style="font-size:100%"&gt;p(''s'')&lt;/span&gt; = 1, and the return, &lt;span style="font-size:100%"&gt;r(''s'')&lt;/span&gt;, is the rate of return on the bill. If the rate of return is 1%, the expected nominal return is calculated as:

:&lt;math&gt; 
\operatorname{E}(r) = \operatorname{p}(s)\operatorname{r}(s) = (1.0)(0.1) = 0.01 = 1%
&lt;/math&gt;

As a slightly more complex, but still simple, scenario analysis, consider a one-year investment in a total stock market index fund, with three possible economic scenarios for the year: recession, normal growth, and strong growth. Assume the following estimates for the three scenarios:

:*Recession: probability &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{p}(s_1)=0.20&lt;/math&gt;, estimated return &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{r}(s_1)= -10%&lt;/math&gt;
:*Normal growth: probability &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{p}(s_2) = 0.60&lt;/math&gt;, estimated return &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{r}(s_2) = 5%&lt;/math&gt;
:*Strong growth: probability &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{p}(s_3) = 0.20&lt;/math&gt;, estimated return &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{r}(s_3) = 10%&lt;/math&gt;

With these scenario estimates, the expected return,&lt;span style="font-size:100%"&gt;E(''r'')&lt;/span&gt;, is calculated as:

:&lt;math&gt; 
\operatorname{E}(r) = \operatorname{p}(s_1)\operatorname{r}(s_1) + 
\operatorname{p}(s_2)\operatorname{r}(s_2) + 
\operatorname{p}(s_3)\operatorname{r}(s_3) 
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; 
\operatorname{E}(r) = (0.20)(-0.10)+(0.60)(0.05)+(0.20)(0.10) = 0.03 = 3%
&lt;/math&gt;

Notice that the expected return of 3% is not equal to the most probable return of 5%.

Extensive research has demonstrated that there are no good forecasters.&lt;ref&gt;Swedroe (2002), ''Rational Investing in Irrational Times'', pp. 191-200. Truman Talley Books, St. Martin's Press, New York &lt;/ref&gt; It follows that scenario analysis itself is fraught with uncertainty. To put it bluntly, expected returns are not directly observable; they can only be estimated.&lt;ref&gt;Ilmanen, p.32&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, financial academics and practitioners develop and publish their estimates of expected returns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Rick Ferri| author-link=Rick Ferri| url=http://www.portfoliosolutions.com/f-13.html| title=The Portfolio Solutions 30-Year Market Forecast For 2012| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121027031840/http://www.portfoliosolutions.com/the-portfolio-solutions-30-year-market-forecast-for-2012/| archive-date=October 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Various links to GMO's latest 7-year forecast can be found by searching for "GMO 7-Year Asset Class Forecasts (February 2012)".

A concept that will be useful in subsequent sections is the ''expected return of a portfolio'', which is simply the weighted average of the expected returns for the individual assets in the portfolio. This is expressed mathematically as:

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}(r_p) = \sum_{i=1}^n (w_i)\operatorname{E}(r_i)&lt;/math&gt;

where ''w&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the percent of the portfolio in asset ''i'', and E(''r&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'') is the expected return of asset ''i''.

==Measuring risk: estimated returns==

A previous section illustrated ''variance'' of returns using ''historical'' returns. The calculation of the variance of estimated ''future'' returns is similar, except that the probabilities of the returns are not equal, but are the probabilities assigned to various scenarios.

Variance of estimated future returns, Var(r), is calculated as follows:

# Subtract the expected return, E(r), from the estimated return, r(s), for the scenario: [r(s) - E(r)]
# Square the result: [r(s) - E(r)]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
# Multiply the result by the probability, p(s), of the scenario: p(s) x [r(s) - E(r)]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
# Sum the resulting values across all scenarios:

::&lt;math&gt; 
\operatorname{Var}(r) = \sigma^2 = 
\operatorname{p}(s_1)[\operatorname{r}(s_1) - \operatorname{E}(r)]^2 + 
\operatorname{p}(s_2)[\operatorname{r}(s_2) - \operatorname{E}(r)]^2 + \cdots +
\operatorname{p}(s_n)[\operatorname{r}(s_n) - \operatorname{E}(r)]^2
&lt;/math&gt;

Or using summation notation:

::&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Var}(r) = \sigma^2 = \sum_{i=1}^n \operatorname{p}(s_i)(r_i - \operatorname{E}(r))^2&lt;/math&gt;

To deepen the intuitive understanding of the calculation of variance of estimated returns, consider the purpose of each step in the calculation. 

# Step 1 yields a number that is larger for a scenario return that is further from the expected return. 
# Step 2 eliminates negative values, so that negative values do not offset positive values; that is, the measure should increase whether a scenario return is less than or greater than the expected return. 
# Step 3 gives a greater weight to a higher-probability scenario.
# Step 4 adds the individual, probability-weighted, squared differences to yield a single number.

The purposes of steps 1, 2 and 4 are basically the same as for the calculation of the variance of ''historical'' returns. Step 3 introduces ''probability weighting''. 

As with historical returns, the ''standard deviation'' of estimated returns is calculated as the ''square root of the variance'' of the estimated returns.

For the case of the nominal return on a 1-year T-Bill yielding 1%, the expected return, E(r), = 1%, and there is only one scenario, for which the nominal return is a certain (p(s) = 1). Therefore, the the variance is calculated as:

:&lt;math&gt; 
\operatorname{Var}(r) = \sigma^2 = 
\operatorname{p}(s_1)[\operatorname{r}(s_1) - \operatorname{E}(r)]^2
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{Var}(r) = \sigma^2 = (1.0)(0.01 - 0.01)^2 &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{Var}(r) = \sigma^2 = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

Since &lt;span style="font-size:100%"&gt;&amp;#8730;0 = 0&lt;/span&gt;, the standard deviation is 0 pp. Note the intuitive sense of this: a standard deviation of 0 indicates zero uncertainty in the return.

Recall the three-scenario case discussed earlier:

:*Recession: probability, p(s&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) = 0.20; estimated return, r(s&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) = -10%
:*Normal growth: probability, p(s&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) = 0.60; estimated return, r(s&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) = 5%
:*Strong growth: probability, p(s&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) = 0.20; estimated return, r(s&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) = 10%

The expected return, E(r), was calculated as 3%. The variance is calculated as:

:&lt;math&gt; 
\operatorname{Var}(r) = \sigma^2 = 
\operatorname{p}(s_1)[\operatorname{r}(s_1) - \operatorname{E}(r)]^2 + 
\operatorname{p}(s_2)[\operatorname{r}(s_2) - \operatorname{E}(r)]^2 +
\operatorname{p}(s_3)[\operatorname{r}(s_3) - \operatorname{E}(r)]^2
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\operatorname{Var}(r) = \sigma^2 = (0.20)(-0.10 - 0.03)^2 + (0.60)(0.05 - 0.03)^2 + (0.20)(0.10 - 0.03)^2
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\operatorname{Var}(r) = \sigma^2 = (0.20)(-0.13)^2 + (0.60)(0.02)^2 + (0.20)(0.07)^2 
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{Var}(r) = \sigma^2 = 0.0046 &lt;/math&gt;

And the standard deviation is:

:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{SD}(r) = \sigma = \sqrt{0.0046} &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{SD}(r) = \sigma = 0.07 = 7% &lt;/math&gt;

Although three samples is not enough to apply the statistical implications of standard deviation, two of the returns fall within E(r) +/- one standard deviation (3% +/- 7 pp), and all returns fall within E(r) +/- two standard deviations (3% +/- 14 pp). Again, standard deviation seems to provide a reasonable measure of the dispersion of returns (risk).

==Managing portfolio risk==

A ''portfolio'' is the investor's collection of financial assets, such as stocks, bonds and cash. Selecting investments to balance the tradeoff between risk and expected return is ''portfolio selection'', ''portfolio construction'', or ''portfolio optimization''. ''Portfolio Theory'' is the theoretical basis for portfolio selection.

Portfolio selection has two main techniques for managing the risk-return tradeoff: diversification, and asset allocation. Diversification means owning enough securities in different industries to reduce or eliminate firm-specific and industry-specific risks. Asset allocation involves building an efficient portfolio, using multiple asset classes (such as stocks, bonds, and cash), that gives an appropriate risk-return tradeoff based on the investor's risk tolerance.

Intuitively, portfolio risk is proportional to the amount of risky assets in the portfolio. A straightforward way to adjust the risk of the complete portfolio is to combine a portfolio of risky assets with a risk-free asset, for example combining a total stock market index fund (the risky portfolio) with T-bills or other money market securities (the risk-free asset). The risk of the complete portfolio will be proportional to the proportion of the risky portfolio included in the complete portfolio, and inversely proportional to the proportion of the risk-free asset. Of course portfolio theory posits that expected return also is proportional to portfolio risk.

Although less intuitive, investors can adjust the portfolio risk-return tradeoff by combining different risky assets in various proportions. For example, they can improve the risk-return tradeoff by selecting a risky portfolio that includes US stocks, non-US stocks, and bonds. A goal of portfolio selection is to find a combination of risky assets that optimizes the ratio of expected return to risk. The ratio of expected return to risk is considered a measure of ''portfolio efficiency''.

Classic portfolio selection consists of two steps:

# Determine an optimal combination of risky assets (the ''risky portfolio'').
# Construct the ''complete portfolio'' by combining the risky portfolio with a risk-free asset in proportions that achieve an appropriate ratio of expected return to risk, based on the investor's risk tolerance.

The resulting portfolio is an efficient portfolio, in that any other combination of risky and risk-free assets would have either a lower expected return for a given level of risk, or more risk for a given level of expected return. Of course since expected returns and risk are not observable, but can only be estimated, portfolio efficiency cannot be known with any great certainty. The most efficient portfolio based on historical returns is unlikely to be the most efficient portfolio going forward. Nevertheless, investors often use historical returns to help estimate appropriate proportions of different risky asset classes to include in a portfolio.

Because step 2 of the two-step process described above involves simpler theory, it will be covered first. 

===Portfolio of risky assets combined with a risk-free asset===
Risky assets include bonds as well as stocks, but for now assume that the risky portfolio is a total stock market index fund. As discussed in previous sections, there is no truly risk-free asset, but T-bills often are considered the risk-free asset in portfolio theory. The risk of T-bills and other money market securities is so much lower than the risk of stocks that this is a reasonable approach, especially for relatively short holding periods.

Both the ''expected return'' and the ''risk'' of a portfolio must be determined to evaluate the ''risk-return trade-off'' of combining a portfolio of risky assets with a risk free asset. The following steps develop an equation that relates the expected return of a such a portfolio to its risk, where risk is measured by the standard deviation of portfolio returns.

''Portfolio of risky assets combined with a risk-free asset: ''Expected return'' ''

The expected return of a portfolio of assets is the the weighted average of the expected returns of the individual assets:

:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{E}(r_p) = w_1 \operatorname{E}(r_1) + w_2 \operatorname{E}(r_2)
 + \cdots + w_n \operatorname{E}(r_n).
&lt;/math&gt;

This can be expressed more concisely using summation notation as:

:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{E}(r_p) = \sum_{i=1}^n w_i \operatorname{E}(r_i). &lt;/math&gt;

The ''weight'' of an asset in a portfolio refers to the fraction of the portfolio invested in that asset. For example, if ''w&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' = &lt;span style="font-size:100%"&gt;&amp;#188;&lt;/span&gt;, then one fourth of the portfolio is invested in asset ''1'' with expected return E(''r&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'').

For ''two assets'' this reduces to:

:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{E}(r_p) = w_1 \operatorname{E}(r_1) + w_2 \operatorname{E}(r_2) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{E}(r_p) = w_1 \operatorname{E}(r_1) + (1 - w_1) \operatorname{E}(r_2)&lt;/math&gt;

Let one asset be the risky portfolio consisting of a total stock market index fund, with expected return E(r&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;) = 6%, and with the standard deviation of annual returns = 20% (these values are very close to the values for the historical returns of the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index fund from 1998 through 2011). Let the other asset be a risk-free asset with return r&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; = 1% (since r&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; is known with certainty, E(r&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;) = r&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;). The rate of return of the risk-free asset is referred to as the ''risk-free rate of return'', or simply the ''risk-free rate''. The standard deviation of the risk-free asset is 0% by definition. Applying the above equation to this portfolio:

:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{E}(r_p) = w_s \operatorname{E}(r_s) + (1 - w_s)(r_f)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{E}(r_p) = w_s \operatorname{E}(r_s) - w_s r_f + r_f&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{E}(r_p) = r_f + w_s (\operatorname{E}(r_s) - r_f)&lt;/math&gt;

E(''r&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'') - ''r&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the ''risk premium'' of the risky portfolio. The expected risk premium of an asset is the expected return of the asset in excess of the risk-free rate. Since the risky portfolio here is a stock fund, its risk premium is referred to as the ''equity risk premium'' or ERP (''equities'' is synonymous with ''stocks'').

Plugging in the risk-free rate and the expected return for the stock fund gives:

:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{E}(r_p) = 0.01 + w_s(0.06 - 0.01) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{E}(r_p) = 0.01 + 0.05w_s &lt;/math&gt;

This is a linear equation indicating that a portfolio of any expected return between ''r&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 1% and E(''r&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'') = 6% can be constructed by combining the risky portfolio and risk-free asset in the desired proportions. The risk premium of the stock fund is 0.05 = 5%.

If ''w&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 0, the portfolio consists only of the risk-free asset, and the expected return of the portfolio is simply the risk-free rate:

:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{E}(r_p) = 0.01 + (0.05)(0) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{E}(r_p) = 0.01 = 1% &lt;/math&gt;

If ''w&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 1, the total portfolio consists entirely of the risky portfolio, and the expected return of the total portfolio is the expected return of the risky portfolio:

:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{E}(r_p) = 0.01 + (0.05)(1) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{E}(r_p) = 0.06 = 6% &lt;/math&gt;

If the portfolio is divided evenly between the risky portfolio and the risk-free asset, ''w&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 0.5, and the expected return of the portfolio is:

:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{E}(r_p) = 0.01 + (0.05)(0.5) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{E}(r_p) = 0.01 + (0.025) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{E}(r_p) = 0.035 = 3.5% &lt;/math&gt;

In the case of a portfolio evenly divided between the risky portfolio and the risk-free asset, ''w&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''w&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;'' = &lt;span style="font-size:100%"&gt;&amp;#189;&lt;/span&gt;, and the expected return is simply the average of the returns of the two assets:

:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{E}(r_p) = \frac {0.01 + 0.06}{2} = 0.035 = 3.5% &lt;/math&gt;

''Portfolio of risky assets combined with a risk-free asset: ''Risk'' ''

Because the standard deviation of a risk-free asset is 0%, the standard deviation of a portfolio formed by combining a portfolio of risky assets with a risk-free asset is simply the standard deviation of the risky portfolio times the proportional weight of the risky portfolio:

:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{SD}(p) = \sigma_p = w_s \sigma_s &lt;/math&gt;

So the risk of the total portfolio is linearly proportional to the weight of the risky portfolio. Given the standard deviation of annual returns of the risky portfolio of stocks = 20%, a portfolio can be constructed with a standard deviation between 0% and 20%. A portfolio evenly divided between the risky portfolio and the risk-free asset would have a standard deviation of 10%.

''Portfolio of risky assets combined with a risk-free asset: ''expected return in terms of risk'' ''

The above equations can be combined to express the expected return of the total portfolio as a function of its standard deviation, thus ''relating the expected return of the portfolio to its risk''. Rearranging the equation for the standard deviation of the total portfolio gives ''w&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'' = &lt;span style="font-size:100%"&gt;&amp;sigma;&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; / &amp;sigma;&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Therefore,

:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{E}(r_p) = r_f + w_s [\operatorname{E}(r_s) - r_f]&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{E}(r_p) = r_f + \frac{\sigma_p}{\sigma_s}[\operatorname{E}(r_s) - r_f]&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{E}(r_p) = r_f + \frac{[\operatorname{E}(r_s) - r_f]}{\sigma_s} \sigma_p&lt;/math&gt;

This is a linear equation that gives portfolio expected return, &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}(r_p)&lt;/math&gt;, as a function of portfolio risk as measured by standard deviation, &lt;math&gt;\sigma_p&lt;/math&gt;, with intercept ''r&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;'' and slope &lt;math&gt; \frac{\operatorname{E}(r_s) - r_f}{\sigma_s} &lt;/math&gt;. The line plotted from this equation is known is the ''Capital Allocation Line'' or ''CAL'', since capital can be allocated between the risky portfolio and risk-free asset to achieve any risk-return combination along the line.

The slope of the CAL is the ratio of the risky portfolio's excess expected return (risk premium) to its risk (that is, its variability as measured by standard deviation). This reward-to-variability ratio is a widely used measure of portfolio efficiency (risk-adjusted return), and is commonly referred to as the ''Sharpe ratio'' (or Sharpe measure), after William Sharpe who first suggested its use.&lt;ref&gt;Bodie, Kane, Marcus, 2008, p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; The steeper the slope of the CAL, the more efficient the portfolios to choose from.

Although the theory being discussed here involves expected (ex-ante) returns, the Sharpe ratio also is commonly used to evaluate the efficiency or risk-adjusted returns of portfolios (for example, mutual funds) based on historical (ex-post) returns.

Substituting in the example numbers of r&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.01, E(r&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;) = 0.06, and σ&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; = 20% = 0.20:

:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{E}(r_p) = r_f + \frac{[\operatorname{E}(r_s) - r_f]}{\sigma_s} \sigma_p&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{E}(r_p) = 0.01 + \frac{0.06 - 0.01}{0.20} \sigma_p&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{E}(r_p) = 0.01 + 0.25 \sigma_p&lt;/math&gt;

So a portfolio of any expected return between 1% and 6% with proportional standard deviation between 0% and 20% can be constructed by combining the risk-free asset and the risky portfolio in appropriate proportions. With a CAL slope of 0.25, portfolio expected return increases by 1 percentage point for each increase of 4 percentage points in portfolio standard deviation (σ&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;); that is, solving this equation for values of σ&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; = 0%, 4%, 8%, 12%, 16% and 20% gives values for E(r&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;) of 1%, 2%, 3%, 4%, 5% and 6%, as shown in the chart in the nearby figure.

===Portfolio of two risky assets===

This section develops the theory that shows the risk-return characteristics for a portfolio consisting of two risky assets. It will be extended to more than two risky assets in the following section. This is the theory that underlies the practice of combining multiple risky assets into a portfolio that has less risk than the weighted sum of the risks of the individual assets. Examples are a mutual fund that includes many individual securities, and a portfolio of mutual funds that includes different asset classes; for example, domestic stocks, foreign stocks, and bonds.

In considering two risky assets, it is convenient to consider two mutual funds, but the same theory applies to any two assets; for example, two individual stocks. In the following section in which portfolios of many assets are considered, it will be more convenient to consider individual securities.

The statistical measures ''covariance'' and ''correlation'' are fundamental to calculating the risk-return characteristics of a portfolio consisting of multiple risky assets. 

Covariance is a measure of how the values of two dependent variables move together, or co-vary, as the value of a common independent variable changes.&lt;ref&gt;Reilly, 1994, p. 245&lt;/ref&gt; The dependent variables of interest in portfolio theory are the returns of the assets in the portfolio, and the independent variable could be a scenario (for example, the state of the economy) or a time period.

Consider the product of the deviations of returns for two assets, stock fund ''s'' and bond fund ''b'', from their expected values for a particular scenario (or during a certain time period):

:&lt;math&gt;
[r_s - \operatorname{E}(r_s)][r_b - \operatorname{E}(r_b)]
&lt;/math&gt;

If the returns of the two assets are both above their expected values (both deviations are positive), or the returns of the two assets are both below their expected values (both deviations are negative), the product of the deviations will be positive. If the return of one asset is above its expected value (positive deviation), and the return of the other asset is below its expected value (negative deviation), the product of the deviations will be negative. Thus the sign of the product of the deviations indicates whether or not the returns have deviated in the same direction or opposite directions, and the magnitude of the product of the deviations indicates how much the returns have deviated from their expected values. The covariance of returns is the expected value of the products of the deviations across all scenarios:

:&lt;math&gt;
\operatorname{Cov}(r_s,r_b) = \sum_{i=1}^n p(i)[(r_s(i) - \operatorname{E}(r_s)][r_b(i) - \operatorname{E}(r_b)]
&lt;/math&gt;

where p(i) is the probability for scenario i, and r&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;(i) and r&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;(i) are the respective returns for the stock and bond fund for scenario i.

Often a more convenient measure to work with is the ''correlation coefficient'', which is computed by dividing the covariance by the product of the standard deviations of the two assets:

:&lt;math&gt;
\rho_{s,b} = \frac{\operatorname{Cov}(r_s,r_b)}{\sigma_s \sigma_b}
&lt;/math&gt;

The correlation coefficient varies from -1 for two perfectly uncorrelated variables to 1 for perfectly correlated variables. A correlation coefficient of 0 indicates no correlation between the two variables.

The variance of the rate of return of a portfolio consisting of two risky assets, in this case stock fund ''s'' and bond fund ''b'', is given by this equation:

:&lt;math&gt;
\sigma_p^2 = (w_s \sigma_s)^2 + (w_b \sigma_b)^2 + 2(w_s \sigma_s)(w_b \sigma_b)\rho_{s,b}
&lt;/math&gt;

or equivalently

:&lt;math&gt;
\sigma_p^2 = (w_s \sigma_s)^2 + (w_b \sigma_b)^2 + 2w_s w_b \operatorname{Cov}(r_s,r_b)
&lt;/math&gt;

where w&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; and w&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; represent the respective proportions (weights) of the portfolio invested in the stock and bond funds, and σ&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; and σ&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; are the respective standard deviations of the stock and bond funds.

The portfolio variance depends on the weighted standard deviations of the assets ''plus'' a term that depends on the covariance (or correlation) of the assets. The smaller the correlation between the assets the lower the portfolio variance.

For a correlation coefficient of 1 (perfectly correlated assets), the equation for portfolio variance is:

:&lt;math&gt;
\sigma_p^2 = (w_s \sigma_s)^2 + (w_b \sigma_b)^2 + 2(w_s \sigma_s)(w_b \sigma_b)
&lt;/math&gt;
which reduces to:
:&lt;math&gt;
\sigma_p^2 = (w_s \sigma_s + w_b \sigma_b)^2
&lt;/math&gt;

and the standard deviation is:

:&lt;math&gt;
\operatorname{SD}(p) = \sigma_p = (w_s \sigma_s + w_b \sigma_b)
&lt;/math&gt;

So for two perfectly, positively correlated assets, the portfolio standard deviation is simply the weighted average of the standard deviations of the two assets. ''Any correlation less than 1 will result in a portfolio standard deviation that is less than the weighted average of the standard deviations of the individual assets''. 

Since the portfolio expected return is the weighted average of the returns of the individual assets (as shown in previous sections), but the standard deviation is less than the weighted average of the assets' standard deviations, ''a portfolio of assets that are not perfectly correlated always provides a better risk-return opportunity than the individual assets on their own.''&lt;ref&gt;Bodie, Kane, Marcus, 1996, p. 197&lt;/ref&gt;

As a simple illustration of this important concept, consider a portfolio of two assets that have the same expected value and standard deviation, but that are not perfectly correlated (correlation coefficient less than 1). The expected value of the portfolio will be the same as the expected value of each asset, but the variance (and standard deviation) of the portfolio will be less than the variance (and standard deviation) of each asset (this can be verified with the above equations). This demonstrates how combining risky assets can result in a portfolio that is less risky than either asset on its own.

[[File:TwoRiskyAssets.png|thumb|right|351px||Investment Opportunity Set of Portfolios Formed by Combining Two Risky Assets in Various Proportions]]

To graphically illustrate the diversification benefit of a portfolio consisting of two risky, imperfectly correlated assets, assume estimates of expected returns of 7% and 8% respectively for a total US stock fund and a total international stock fund, respective standard deviations of 18% and 20%, and a correlation coefficient of 0.8. The nearby figure shows a graph of expected return vs. standard deviation for portfolios consisting of various proportions of each fund.

The lower left point represents the return and standard deviation of the US stock fund, and the upper right point represents return and standard deviation of the international stock fund. Every other point represents a portfolio consisting of both funds. Each point represents a 10 percentage point change in the proportions of each fund. The expected return and standard deviations for each point are calculated using the above equations.

Notice that a portfolio consisting of 60% US stocks and 40% international stocks provides a higher expected return (about 7.4%) with a lower standard deviation (about 17.9%) than a portfolio consisting of 100% US stocks. This is because the correlation coefficient, 0.8, is less than 1. If the correlation coefficient were 1, the investment opportunity set would consist of a straight line between the lower left point and the upper right point. The degree to which the investment opportunity set curve bulges to the left of a straight line connecting the endpoints represents the diversification benefit due to imperfect correlation.

Of course expected returns, standard deviations, and correlation coefficients cannot be known in advance, so the diversification benefit of combining two risky assets is only as good as your estimates of these values. It is common to use historical values as a starting point in estimating the inputs required to construct an efficient portfolio. 

For example, based on their analysis of historical returns, Vanguard's research group as concluded that it is reasonable for US investors to allocate between 20% and 40% of the stock portion of their portfolios to international stocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| publisher=Vanguard Investment Counseling &amp; Research| date=2006| url=https://institutional.vanguard.com/iwe/pdf/FASIECR_112006.pdf| title=International Equity: Considerations and Recommendations| accessdate=August 10, 2012}}{{dead link}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vanguard currently allocates 30% to international stocks in the stock portions of their balanced index funds, such as the Target Retirement and LifeStrategy funds.

===Portfolio of many risky assets===

The general equation for the variance of a portfolio of risky assets is:

:&lt;math&gt; \sigma_p^2 = \sum_{i=1}^n w_i^2 \sigma_{i}^2 
 + \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1,j \neq i}^n w_i w_j \sigma_i \sigma_j \rho_{ij}, 
&lt;/math&gt;

Recalling that &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Cov}(i,j) = \sigma_i \sigma_j \rho_{ij} &lt;/math&gt;, the equation can be rewritten more succinctly as:

:&lt;math&gt; \sigma_p^2 = \sum_{i=1}^n w_i^2 \sigma_{i}^2 
 + \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1 j \neq i}^n w_i w_j \operatorname{Cov}(i,j). 
&lt;/math&gt;

The terms summed on the left are the ''variances of the individual assets'' multiplied by the squared portfolio weights of the assets. The double summation on the right represents the summation across all assets of the ''covariance of each pair of assets'' multiplied by the portfolio weights of the assets in each pair. 

The condition &lt;span style="font-size:100%"&gt;''j &amp;#8800; i''&lt;/span&gt; indicates that the covariance of an asset with itself is not included in the double summation. The covariance of an asset with itself is the asset's variance — that is, &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Cov}(i,i) = \sigma_i^2&lt;/math&gt; — and the assets' variances already are included in the summation on the left. To clarify this point, the equation can be rewritten as:

:&lt;math&gt; \sigma_p^2 = \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n w_i w_j \operatorname{Cov}(i,j). 
&lt;/math&gt;

When ''i'' = ''j'', the term included in the sum is:

:&lt;math&gt;w_i w_i \operatorname{Cov}(i,i) = w_i^2 \sigma_i^2&lt;/math&gt;,

which represents term ''i'' in the first summation in the equation as previously written. So factoring out the sum of terms where ''i'' = ''j'' gives the equation as previously written.

Expanding this equation for a portfolio of two risky assets gives:

:&lt;math&gt;
\sigma_p^2 = (w_1 \sigma_1)^2 + (w_2 \sigma_2)^2 
 + w_1 w_2 \operatorname{Cov}(1,2)
 + w_2 w_1 \operatorname{Cov}(2,1).
&lt;/math&gt;

There are two variance terms and two covariance terms. Since &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Cov}(1,2) = \operatorname{Cov}(2,1)&lt;/math&gt;, the equation can be simplified to:

:&lt;math&gt;
\sigma_p^2 = (w_1 \sigma_1)^2 + (w_2 \sigma_2)^2 
 + 2 w_1 w_2 \operatorname{Cov}(1,2).
&lt;/math&gt;

So although there two covariance terms before simplifying, only one covariance term must be calculated. This is the equation used in the previous section. 

For three risky assets the equation expands to:

:&lt;math&gt;
\sigma_p^2 = (w_1 \sigma_1)^2 + (w_2 \sigma_2)^2 
 + 2 w_1 w_2 \operatorname{Cov}(1,2)
 + 2 w_1 w_3 \operatorname{Cov}(1,3)
 + 2 w_2 w_3 \operatorname{Cov}(2,3).
&lt;/math&gt;

There are three variance terms and six original covariance terms, three of which must be calculated after simplifying the equation as written. As more assets are added to the portfolio, the number of covariance terms becomes much larger than the number of variance terms. Specifically, there are ''n'' variance terms and n(n-1) covariance terms (but only n(n-1)/2 covariance terms that must be calculated). It is intuitive that for a large number of assets the covariance terms will dominate the result; that is, ''the covariance between asset pairs will have much more impact on overall portfolio variance than the variances of the individual assets''.

For asset pairs with given expected returns, lower covariance (correlation) between asset pairs in the portfolio results in lower portfolio variance and a more efficient portfolio. Portfolio efficiency is the ratio of expected excess portfolio return to portfolio variance. This demonstrates the diversification benefit of building a portfolio of many assets with less than perfect correlation.

To further illustrate the benefit of diversification, consider the case in which a portfolio is constructed of many assets held in equal proportions. In this case w&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; = &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; for each asset, and the equation for portfolio variance becomes:

:&lt;math&gt; \sigma_p^2 = 
 \sum_{i=1}^n (\frac1n)^2 \sigma_{i}^2 
 + \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1 j \neq i}^n (\frac1n)(\frac1n) \operatorname{Cov}(i,j).
&lt;/math&gt;

With appropriate factoring, this equation can be rewritten as:

:&lt;math&gt; \sigma_p^2 = 
 \frac1n \sum_{i=1}^n \frac1n \sigma_{i}^2 
 + \frac{n-1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1 j \neq i}^n \frac {\operatorname{Cov}(i,j)}{n(n-1)}.
&lt;/math&gt;

The summation of terms on the left is the average variance of the assets. As n becomes large ''1/n'' approaches 0, so the term on the left approaches 0. This term represents the ''nonsystematic risk'' of the individual assets that can be diversified away by including a sufficiently large number of assets in the portfolio. In other words, in a portfolio of many assets, the variances of the individual assets have little impact on the variance of the portfolio.

The double summation of terms on the right is the average covariance of the assets. As n becomes large, ''(n-1)/n'' approaches 1, so the term on the right approaches the average covariance. This term represents the ''systematic risk'' of the portfolio that cannot be diversified away. 

This further demonstrates that it is the covariance between the assets in a portfolio of many assets that dominates the overall portfolio risk, and that the variances of the individual assets have little impact on the overall portfolio risk.

The sources of systematic risk are the economic factors that affect the the overall market. For example, the level of economic growth affects all companies to some extent, and therefore affects the returns of all stocks to some extent.

The portion of an asset's return variation that is ''not'' related to the market portfolio is referred to as ''unsystematic risk'' or ''nonsystematic risk''. The sources of unsystematic risk are the ''firm-specific risks'' of individual companies, as opposed to the broader economic factors that have some effect on all companies.

As shown above, unsystematic risks can be eliminated, or "diversified away", by owning a portfolio of many assets that are not perfectly correlated. So one way to manage risk is to reduce or eliminate unsystematic risk by holding a large number of such securities--ultimately by holding all securities in the market. This is the theoretical foundation for owning a total market mutual fund, such as a total stock market or total bond market index fund.

Determining the expected return and variance of a portfolio using the equations developed so far requires estimating ''n'' expected returns, ''n'' variances, and ''n(n-1)/2'' covariances. For a portfolio of many assets, the number of covariances that must be estimated becomes problematic. Index models provide a solution to this problem. An index model is an implementation of a factor model. The Capital Asset Pricing Model, or CAPM, provides the theoretical foundation for a single-factor model.

===CAPM and single factor models===

Given a simplifying set of assumptions, CAPM provides an equation that relates the excess expected return of asset ''i'' to its expected covariance with the expected excess return of the market portfolio ''M'':

:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{E}(r_i)- r_f = \frac {\operatorname{Cov}(i,M)}{\sigma_M^2} (r_M - r_f)&lt;/math&gt;.

Excess expected return is the expected return of the asset or market portfolio minus the risk-free rate r&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;. The market portfolio is a theoretical portfolio consisting of all marketable, risky assets; for example, stocks, bonds, real estate, commodities, collectibles, and so on. 

Isolating the expected return of asset ''i'' on the left hand side of the equation gives:

:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{E}(r_i) = r_f + \frac {\operatorname{Cov}(i,M)}{\sigma_M^2} (r_M - r_f)&lt;/math&gt;.

Defining the term &lt;math&gt;\frac {\operatorname{Cov}(i,M)}{\sigma_M^2}&lt;/math&gt; as beta (&lt;math&gt;\beta_i&lt;/math&gt;), the equation can be rewritten as:

:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{E}(r_i) = r_f + \beta_i (r_M - r_f)&lt;/math&gt;.

Beta standardizes the measure of systematic risk by dividing the covariance of the asset with the market portfolio, &lt;math&gt;{\operatorname{Cov}(i,M)}&lt;/math&gt;, by the variance of the market portfolio, &lt;math&gt;{\sigma_M^2}&lt;/math&gt;. Since the covariance of an asset with itself is the variance of the asset, this results in a beta of 1 for the market portfolio. The ''expected return-beta'' equation above is the formulation of CAPM most widely used by investment professionals.&lt;ref&gt;Bodie, Kane, Marcus, 1996, p 244&lt;/ref&gt;

The CAPM model relates expected return to expected risk, and involves a theoretical market portfolio consisting of all risky assets. Since expected returns are not observable, and in practice the market portfolio is not observable, factor models and index models were developed to enable investment professionals to put the theory behind CAPM into practice.

In a ''single-factor model'' it is assumed that all unexpected macroeconomic events affecting the asset returns in a market can be summarized by one common factor, and that all remaining uncertainty in asset returns is firm specific.&lt;ref&gt;Bodie, Kane, Marcus, 1996, p. 267&lt;/ref&gt; Recognizing that each firm will have a different sensitivity to macroeconomic events, the following equation relates the return on security ''i'' to the common macroeconomic factor ''F'':

:&lt;math&gt; r_i = \operatorname{E}(r_i) + \beta_i F + e_i &lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}(r_i)&lt;/math&gt; is the expected return on security ''i'' at the beginning of the holding period, &lt;math&gt;\beta_i&lt;/math&gt; is the sensitivity of security ''i'' to macroeconomic factor ''F'', and ''e&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is component of return due to the impact of unanticipated firm-specific events.

A ''single-index model'' uses the excess return on a market index, such as the S&amp;P 500, as a proxy for the common macroeconomic factor. Broader proxies for the market portfolio can be used; for example, all US stocks, all global stocks, or all global stocks and bonds. A single-index model equation for the excess holding period return on security ''i'' is:

:&lt;math&gt; r_i - r_f = \alpha_i + \beta_i (r_M - r_f) + e_i \,&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;\alpha_i&lt;/math&gt; is the security's expected return if the excess market return is 0%, &lt;math&gt;r_M&lt;/math&gt; is the market index return, &lt;math&gt;\beta_i&lt;/math&gt; is the sensitivity of security ''i'' to the market index, and ''e&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the component of return due to unexpected firm-specific events.

Some authors express the single-index model in terms of total returns rather than excess returns.&lt;ref&gt;Elton et. al., 2003, pp. 132-133&lt;/ref&gt;

Using capital ''R'' to represent excess return, the equation can be written more simply as:

:&lt;math&gt; R_i = \alpha_i + \beta_i R_M + e_i \,&lt;/math&gt;.

In this equation &lt;span style="font-size:100%"&gt;''&amp;beta;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;R&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;/span&gt; represents a source of ''systematic risk'' based on the security's sensitivity to the market index (a proxy for macroeconomic factors), and &lt;span style="font-size:120%"&gt;''e&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;/span&gt; represents a source of ''unsystematic risk'' based on firm-specific events.

Since expected returns are not observable, beta typically is calculated using periodic historical returns over a specified time period; for example, weekly or monthly returns over the previous three to five years. For example, Morningstar calculates beta based on monthly returns over the previous 36 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| publisher=Morningstar| date=2005| url=http://corporate.morningstar.com/us/documents/MethodologyDocuments/MethodologyPapers/MorningstarMPTStatistics_Methodology.pdf| title=Morningstar MPT Statistics Methodology| accessdate=August 10, 2012}}{{dead link}}&lt;/ref&gt; The above equation is used as the basis of a linear regression analysis in which the dependent variable is the excess return of the individual asset, R&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, the independent variable is the excess return of the market index, R&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;, and beta is the regression coefficient (slope of the line). 

This can be represented graphically as follows. A scatter plot of R&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; vs. R&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; is generated in which the vertical axis measures the excess returns of the individual asset, and the horizontal axis measures the excess returns of the market index. Each point in the scatter plot represents a pair of excess returns for one period (week or month). A best-fit line is drawn through the points. The slope of the line is beta, and the vertical intercept is alpha. The vertical distance from the line of each point for period ''i'' is e&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, the deviation from the regression line.

The variance of the excess return on security ''i'' can be written as:

:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{Var}(R_i) = \sigma_i^2 = \beta_i^2 \sigma_M^2 + \sigma^2(e_i) &lt;/math&gt;.

On the right hand side of the equation, the first term is the variance due to uncertainty in the common macroeconomic factors (as represented by the market index), and the second term is the variance due to firm-specific uncertainty.

The covariance between the excess rates of return on any two securities is:

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Cov}(R_i,R_j) = \operatorname{Cov}(\beta_i R_M, \beta_j R_M) = \beta_i \beta_j \sigma_M^2
&lt;/math&gt;.

From these equations it can be determined that (3''n'' + 1) estimates are required to evaluate the portfolio variance for ''n'' securities. This is many fewer estimates than the 2''n'' + ''n''(''n'' - 1)/2 estimates required using variances and covariances directly.

=== Multifactor models ===

Although CAPM and the related single-factor model have had significant impact on finance theory and practice, empirical studies have shown significant discrepancies between historical data and predictions of the CAPM-based single factor model. This may not be surprising considering the simplification of assuming that only a single factor affects the systematic variation in security prices. Theoretical work has been done attempting to use more than one factor to explain the systematic risk of securities.

Two of the discrepancies mentioned above are the long-term returns of small company stocks and stocks with high ratios of book value to market value (value stocks), which are higher than predicted by CAPM. Motivated by these anomalies, Fama and French conducted research that resulted in what is commonly referred to as the [[Fama and French three-factor model | Fama-French three-factor model]].

One of the three factors is the market portfolio (more specifically, an index representing the market), as in CAPM. The other two factors are SmB (Small minus Big) and HmL (High minus Low). SmB is a theoretical portfolio represented by the returns of small-cap stocks minus the returns of large-cap stocks (hence, Small minus Big or SmB). HmL is a theoretical portfolio represented by the returns of high book-to-market stocks minus the returns of low book-to-market stocks (hence, High minus Low or HmL).

Fama and French's research indicated that regressing the empirical data against the three factors explained the returns of stock portfolios much better than did the CAPM-based single-factor model. The equation used to perform the regressions is:

:&lt;math&gt; 
r_i - r_f = \alpha_i + \beta_M (r_M - r_f) + \beta_h r_{HmL} + \beta_s r_{SmB} + e_i 
\,&lt;/math&gt;.

Each of the betas in the equation represent the sensitivity of a stock or portfolio of stocks to the corresponding factor. The empirically derived beta values can be considered as explaining how much of a portfolio's return can be explained by exposure to the respective factors. A portfolio more heavily weighted toward small-cap and value stocks would be expected to have higher values of &lt;span style="font-size:100%"&gt;''&amp;beta;&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="font-size:100%"&gt;''&amp;beta;&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;/span&gt;.

This result is based on empirical research, not a theory related to specific risk factors. Therefore, one conclusion is that SmB and HmL may be ''proxies'' for exposure to sources of systematic risk not captured by the single CAPM factor of overall market risk.

Investors who believe that SmB and HmL are valid proxies for systematic risk factors may decide to increase their allocations to small-cap stocks and value stocks. This is informally referred to as ''tilting'' toward small and value.

==Assessing risk tolerance==
{{Main|Assessing risk tolerance}}

Assessing risk tolerance is a critical step in determining the appropriate trade off between the risk and expected return of a portfolio. Selecting a mix of risky and risk-free assets (or higher-risk and lower-risk assets) is one of the most important decisions in designing a portfolio. The investor must develop a rational assessment of risk tolerance to make rational decisions about this asset allocation during portfolio design.

Most approaches to assessing risk tolerance consider attitude toward risk and investment time horizon in one way or another. Other factors that affect ability to compensate for investment losses include net worth, stability of income, future liabilities, and flexibility of goals.

*The [[Bogleheads' Guide To Investing]] explores four areas: Goals, Time frame, Risk tolerance, Personal financial situation. Tools are recommended to help factor risk into your asset allocation. Various sample portfolios are presented based on these "stages in life". 
*Bogleheads author [[Larry Swedroe]] suggests that investors evaluate their risk tolerance by considering their ''ability, willingness and need'' to take risk.
*Bogleheads author [[William Bernstein]] discusses determining appropriate risk exposure in the context of deciding on your allocation between stocks and bonds based on age and risk tolerance (attitude toward risk), at least as a starting point.
*Bogleheads author [[Rick Ferri]] suggests using a modified version of the age in bonds rule of thumb to help decide on the split between higher-risk and lower-risk assets, and presents asset allocation decisions in terms of a life-cycle investing framework.
*Daniel R. Solin in his book ''The Smartest Money Book You'll Ever Read'', has a full chapter titles ''Assessing Your Risk Capacity'' where he presents five major factors for assessing risk capacity.
*The CFA Institute discusses Investors and Objectives, Investor constraints (Liquidity, Investment Horizon, Regulations, Tax Considerations, Unique Needs.

=== Self-assessment questionnaires ===
Various advisory services offer self-assessment questionnaires to help determine your risk tolerance and define an initial asset allocation. Such tools are useful with caveats.

==Managing financial risk==

Investment risk, or financial-asset risk, is only one type of financial risk facing households. Other major categories of risk are:&lt;ref&gt;Bodie, Merton, 2000, p. 259&lt;/ref&gt;

* Sickness, disability, and death.
* Unemployment risk.
* Consumer-durable asset risk: for example, the risk of loss from fire, theft or obsolescence related to owning a car, house, or other consumer-durable asset. 
* Liability risk: for example, the possibility of being sued.

Managing these types of risks, as well as managing investment risk, from a broader financial planning perspective is the topic of this section.

==Short term risk vs. long term risk==
Mentioned in "Risk as the possibility of loss" section, perhaps here we go into more detail on terminal wealth dispersion, how small differences in annualized return can result in large differences in terminal wealth, stocks ''are'' risky in the long run, and so on. This is covered in Bodie, Kane, Marcus, 2008.

See Bernstein's [http://www.efficientfrontier.com/ef/900/15st.htm "The 15 Stock Myth"] for more on terminal wealth dispersion, but there he focuses on the danger of a portfolio with only a small number of stocks. He does emphasize that such portfolios, although they may have low standard deviation of monthly returns, also have a large dispersion of terminal wealth.

Over time the meaning has been extended.&lt;/ref&gt; DCA is an alternative to lump sum investing, which is to make the entire investment immediately. It is a technique to overcome fear in investing by mitigating the risk of loss over the short term. 

For any sequence of constant-dollar purchases&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Equal parts means that the amount (dollars) is constant, hence the term "constant-dollar".&lt;/ref&gt; of an asset whose price fluctuates, you would purchase more shares when prices are lower than when prices are high.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dollarcostaveraging.asp| title=Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) Explained With Examples and Considerations| publisher=Investopedia| date=April 26, 2023| accessdate=August 12, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the average cost per share will be lower than the average price per share over the same period.

This consequence of DCA provides an argument to persuade investors to make systematic, periodic fixed dollar amount investments regardless of market prices. 

The term DCA is also encompasses similar investment concepts such as [[#Automatic investment|periodic automatic investment]] (used almost universally by individual investors to fund retirement accounts out of earned income).

A variant on the idea of DCA is "[[#Reverse dollar cost averaging|reverse dollar-cost averaging]]", which relates to periodic automatic withdrawals made during retirement.&lt;ref name="Hebeler"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.analyzenow.com/Articles/Investments/Investment%20Articles/ReverseDollarCostAvg1-1-01.pdf| title=Reverse Dollar Cost Averaging| author=Henry K. Hebeler| date=January 2, 2001| accessdate=August 12, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, [[value averaging]] closely resembles dollar-cost averaging but differs in that the investor selects a target growth rate or amount on their asset base or portfolio each period, and then adjusts the next period's contribution according to the relative gain or shortfall made on the original asset base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/value_averaging.asp| title=Value Averaging: What it Means, Examples| publisher=Investopedia| date=May 5, 2022| accessdate=August 12, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dollar-cost averaging versus lump sum==
When you are ready to invest money, a common question is whether you should invest it as a '''lump sum''' or '''dollar-cost average (DCA)''' by splitting your investment across several payments. The answer depends on the degree to which you are willing to accept lower expected returns in exchange for lower potential losses (aversion to possible loss).

In most cases, you are moving your money from cash (or the equivalent, a low-yielding [[Money markets | money market]]) to some mix of [[Stock basics | stocks]] and [[Bond basics | bonds]]. The expected return of both stocks and bonds is higher than cash. However, their volatility is higher as well. The risk is that just after making your investment, the market could crash, causing your investment to quickly lose value due to the unfortunate timing of your purchase. 

Of course, according to [[Bogleheads® investment philosophy | Bogleheads investment philosophy]], you should only be investing in the first place into a diversified asset allocation. Also, you should only be holding volatile funds like stocks and bonds if your investing horizon is long enough to ride out their volatility.

Lump sum investing will always carry a higher expected return, because it immediately moves your funds from asset classes with lower expected returns to ones with higher expected returns. Note that higher ''expected'' returns do not guarantee that your ''actual'' returns will be higher. A Vanguard study&lt;ref name=":0"&gt; {{cite web| url=https://pressroom.vanguard.com/nonindexed/7.23.2012_Dollar-cost_Averaging.pdf| title=Dollar-cost averaging just means taking risk later| publisher=Vanguard| date=July 23, 2012| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121107195530/https://pressroom.vanguard.com/nonindexed/7.23.2012_Dollar-cost_Averaging.pdf| archive-date=November 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; concluded that lump sum investing has historically produced higher returns two thirds of the time when the DCA plan was implemented over 12 months. Lump sum was also more favorable when the analysis used risk-adjusted returns.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; DCA plans with longer timelines have worse results. A related Vanguard publication notes that if a DCA plan was implemented over 36 months, lump sum investing produced higher returns approximately 92% of the time. In addition, over a 12-month period, the maximum downside potential of DCA was higher than the maximum upside potential.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Berkowitz|first=Daniel B.|date=2016|title=Invest now or temporarily hold your cash?|url=https://www.optimizedportfolio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/vanguard-invest-now-or-temporarily-hold-your-cash.pdf|publisher=Vanguard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some investors are willing to sacrifice some expected return in order to reduce their potential loss, knowing that higher expected return come with higher potential loss. For those investors, dollar-cost averaging is superior because it reduces the chances of investing all the money just prior to a market drop. Instead, as the price fluctuates each month, you will buy more shares when the price is low and less when it is high. In such volatile markets your actual return can be higher than the return of the lumpsum which will match the return of the assets. 

Many new investors are more interested in minimizing their potential loss, and it is important that an ill-timed market drop does not scare them off from investing in the future. Many experienced investors are more interested in maximizing their expected returns. You can also decide to split the difference, where you invest half immediately and the other half over 6 or so months.

=== Costs===

Most no-load mutual funds allow small, regular investments with no fees. However, most investors pay a commission to purchase a load-fund or an [[Exchange-traded fund]] (ETF). Depending on the size of the commission and the investment, dollar-cost averaging into a load-fund or an ETF could be far more expensive than purchasing as a lump sum. For ETFs, the [[bid/ask spread]] is the same between DCA and lump sum.

==Automatic investment==

Most investors make regular contributions through their [[401(k)]] plans or by having a set amount auto-deducted from their bank account into an [[IRA]] or taxable account. When this money is automatically invested, it has the same benefit of dollar-cost averaging that you buy more shares when prices are low and less when they are high. However, this form of investing is not dollar-cost averaging. It is called '''periodic investing'''. The difference is that periodic investing is maximizing expected return, because you are investing the money as soon as you have it. DCA applies when you have the money to invest, but delay doing so.

===Switching to a more conservative portfolio===

Some investors who are new to a [[Bogleheads® investment philosophy | Bogleheads investment philosophy]] may find their portfolios contain too much equity. Even worse, some investors have a large portion of their net worth held in a single stock, such as through an employee purchase plan. They generally want to sell some of their equities and buy bonds. In these cases where an investor wants to move from high risk and volatility assets to lower risk and volatility assets, a lump sum transaction makes more sense than DCA. That is because lump sum both immediately moves to the expected return and volatility the investor wants, while also minimizing potential regret.

==Reverse dollar-cost averaging==

Investors who regularly add to their investment portfolios with '''periodic investing''' purchase more shares when prices are low and less shares when prices are high. Author Henry K. Hebeler&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Henry K. Hebeler |title=Getting Started in A Financially Secure Retirement| publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons| date=April 27, 2007| isbn=978-0-470-11778-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; points out that investors ''' periodically distributing''' retirement income from their portfolios experience the reverse action, redeeming more shares when prices are low and less shares when prices are high. Hebeler terms this process, "reverse dollar-cost averaging" with results that should, on average, reduce expected returns.

Examining rolling 20 year investment periods from 1927 to 1995 for a portfolio consisting of 50% large cap stocks ([[S&amp;P 500 index|S&amp;P 500]]); 40% long term [[Corporate bonds|corporate bonds]]; and 10% [[Treasury bill|treasury bills]], with expense loadings of 1.50% for stocks; 0.50% for bonds; and 0.30% for cash), Hebeler provides average real returns for four scenarios: the portfolio; the accumulating investor (saving for retirement); the distributing investor (withdrawal during retirement); as well as the results of 80% percentile returns (reflecting desires for portfolio survivability for retirement distributions). Indexing the portfolios would add 0.70% to each portfolio's returns simply due to reduced costs.&lt;ref name="Hebeler" /&gt;

Understanding and avoiding '''behavioral pitfalls''' has a greater final impact on your investing success than any other factor. Because emotions and subsequent behavioral pitfalls often lead to miscalculating [[risk tolerance]] and [[Asset allocation|asset allocation]], you need to be aware of behavioral pitfalls before making asset allocation decisions. 

{{Quotation|"Your investing brain does not just add and multiply and estimate and evaluate," says Jason Zweig in his book, ''Your Money and Your Brain''.&lt;ref name="Zwieg"&gt;{{cite book| title=Your Money and Your Brain: How the New Science of Neuroeconomics Can Help Make You Rich| publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster| date=August 1, 2007| isbn=978-0-7432-7668-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; "When you win, lose, or risk money, you stir up some of the most profound emotions a human being can ever feel."|Jason Zweig}}

{{Quotation|"Financial decision-making," says psychologist [[Daniel Kahneman]] in Zweig’s book, "is not necessarily about money. It’s also about intangible motives like avoiding regret or achieving pride."|Daniel Kahneman}}

==Common behavioral  pitfalls==
===Anchoring===
Basing decisions on a past value or event (the "anchor"), even though the value or event has no relevance to the decision. For example, we tend to hang on to losing investments by waiting for the investment to break even at the price at which we bought it. As a result, we anchor the value of our investment to the value it once had, and instead of selling it to realize the loss, we increase risk by holding it and hoping it will go back up to its purchase price.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/anchoring.asp| title=Anchoring in Investing: Overview and Examples| publisher=Investopedia| date=May 20, 2021| accessdate=June 1, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note" name="freebeer"&gt;An example of ''framing effect'' (a form of anchoring) and ''confirmation bias'' on purchasing homeowners insurance is in this {{forum post| p=1789459| title=Re: Sometimes Safer NOT to Carry Homeowners Insurance (!?)}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
===Confirmation bias===
A tendency to seek information that confirms our existing opinions, and overlook or ignore information that refutes them. For example, when researching an investment, we inadvertently look for information that supports our beliefs, and miss information that presents different ideas. The resulting one-sided view can result in a poor investment choice.&lt;ref name="confirm"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/confirmation-bias.asp| title=Confirmation Bias: Overview and Types and Impact| publisher=Investopedia| date=September 29, 2022| accessdate=June 1, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; "In short, your own mind acts like a compulsive yes-man who echoes whatever you want to believe," says Wall Street Journal columnist Jason Zweig.&lt;ref name="Zwieg"/&gt;&lt;ref group="note" name="freebeer" /&gt;

===Endowment effect===
The tendency to value something you already own more highly than its market value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/endowment-effect.asp| title=Endowment Effect: Definition, What Causes It, and Example| publisher=Investopedia| date=February 17, 2023| accessdate=October 29, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt; Employer stock options or restricted stock units (RSUs) might be one example. With these, you receive a part of your employment compensation as shares in your employer. The endowment effect would be if you hold on to these shares, where had you instead received this compensation as cash you would not have used it to buy them. Another example might be if you inherit shares that you would not otherwise buy and continue to hold them, rather than selling and then investing the proceeds in your own choice of shares or funds.

===Framing effect===
The large changes of preferences that are sometimes caused by inconsequential variations in the wording of a choice problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Daniel Kahneman| author-link=Daniel Kahneman| title=Thinking, Fast and Slow| chapter=Chapter 7, A Machine for Jumping to Conclusions| isbn=978-0-14-103357-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, purchasing an item. The price is advertised as either (1) "$10.00 with a $0.50 cash discount" or (2) "$9.50 and a $0.50 credit card premium." The price is the same. But we feel much better with the first choice (allowing a discount), than with the second (adding a premium).&lt;ref group="note" name="freebeer" /&gt;

===Gambler's fallacy===
The belief that heads on a coin flip is more likely after a string of tails, red in roulette is more likely after a string of black, and in general good luck is more likely after a string of bad luck, and vice versa. We may expect an investment that has recently experienced losses to "revert to the mean" of its former upward trajectory, or anticipate increased risk after a period of steady gains. While examples of these patterns are easy to find in the past, they are of little value in predicting the future.

===Herd behavior===
A human instinct that causes people to mimic the actions of a larger group rather than decide independently based on their own information. For example, in a bull market, we join the crowd to avoid being the only one to miss out; in a bear market, we get out to avoid being the only one to lose. In both cases, we abandon our own reasoning and conclude the majority must be right. Herd investors often do not have a sound investment plan and they listen to market noise.&lt;ref name="BogleheadsGuide"/&gt;

===Loss aversion===
Loss aversion is the emotional tendency to strongly prefer avoiding losses over acquiring gains. As an example, loss aversion implies that if we lose $100, our emotional pain is much larger than the satisfaction we would feel from receiving $100. Common indications include checking your portfolio on an almost daily basis, selling funds before you intended to lock in profits, or selling when you did not intend to in order to avoid further losses.

===Mental accounting===
Our tendency to put money into separate accounts based on a variety of subjective criteria, for example, the source of the money and intent for each account. According to the theory, we may assign different functions to each asset group, which has an often irrational and detrimental effect on their consumption decisions and other behaviors. For example, people often have a special "money jar" or fund set aside for a vacation or a new home, while still carrying substantial credit card debt. 

===Money illusion===
Money illusion is a tendency to think of money in nominal terms, instead of inflation-adjusted terms. For example, some people will be happy to get a 1% nominal return on an ''safe'' investment during a year when inflation was 2%, yet they would be unhappy with a 1% loss on the same investment in a year with no inflation, despite the two situations representing a 1% annual loss in inflation-adjusted terms. Money illusion can lead us to underestimate the loss to inflation of a fixed nominal income stream over time, or to overestimate the value of a promised nominal income stream that starts far into the future.

===Myopic loss aversion===
Myopic loss aversion is loss aversion intensified by constant attention to short-term portfolio performance. This behavior leads us to focus on recent losses, which increases trading without paying attention to our overall portfolio or the long term view. Myopic loss aversion causes poor portfolio management and lower returns. It also may help explain the equity risk premium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://mutualfunds.com/expert-analysis/myopic-loss-aversion-and-the-equity-risk-premium-puzzle/| title=Myopic Loss Aversion and the Equity Risk Premium Puzzle| author=Larry Swedroe| author-link=Larry Swedroe| publisher=MutualFunds.com| date=October 12, 2016| accessdate=June 1, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Overconfidence===
Being overconfident in our investing abilities can lead to big investing losses. In the short term, the ups and downs of the stock market are random. These unpredictable variations mean that intelligence, skill, and knowledge give us no edge, and thinking they do can be "hazardous to your wealth."&lt;ref name="BogleheadsGuide"&gt;{{cite book| author1=Taylor Larimore| author1-link=Taylor Larimore| author2=Mel Lindauer| author2-link=Mel Lindauer| author3=Michael LeBoeuf| author3-link=Michael LeBoeuf| title=The Bogleheads' Guide to Investing| chapter=Chapter 19, Mastering Investments Means Mastering Emotions| publisher=Wiley| edition=1| date=September 28, 2007| isbn=978-0-470-06736-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The only way to achieve everything you’re capable of is to accept what you are not capable of," says Jason Zweig.&lt;ref name="Zwieg"/&gt;

===Paralysis by analysis===
We have thousands of funds to choose from, and an abundance of market "noise" telling us what we should do. The more choices we have, the harder it is for us to choose one, making it more likely we will not make a choice and will fail to invest. For example, employees pass up billions every year in free money offered by their employer’s matching retirement plans. They do this simply because they cannot decide which investment course to take.&lt;ref name="BogleheadsGuide"/&gt;

===Recency bias===
The tendency to draw conclusions about the future behavior of an investment from only the recent past. This leads to us chasing performance and then buying high and selling low. "When funds go on a streak of high returns, investors tend to get in right before the peak; then, when the hot streak goes cold, too many shareholders bail out at the bottom," explains Jason Zweig.&lt;ref name="Zwieg"/&gt;

===Regret aversion===
A theory that says we anticipate regret if we make a choice that is wrong in hindsight, and take this anticipation into consideration when making decisions. Fear of regret can play a large role in dissuading or motivating someone to do something. In investing, the fear of regret can make us either risk averse, or alternatively, motivate us to take greater risks.

We tend to anticipate greater regret from action than from inaction. For example, we may fear missing out on gains if we rebalance out of stocks (action) and the market keeps going up more than we fear losses if we hold tight (inaction) and the market goes down. However, we may fear those same losses more than the potential gains when deciding to invest new money in the market (action).

Fear of regret may also cause us to act if we will later be faced with the consequences of our inaction, such as being left out while our friend makes money on a stock tip or learning that we would have won a lottery.

==Theory and background==
{{Quotation|Investing is not a science. It is a human activity that involves both emotional as well as rational behavior.|John Bogle|The Clash of the Cultures}}

===What is behavioral economics?===
Behavioral economics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.investopedia.com/behavioral-economics-4689799| title=Introduction to Behavioral Economics| publisher=Investopedia| accessdate=June 1, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; explores the emotions and biases that lead investors and consumers to sometimes make irrational economic decisions. It also studies why and how their behavior does not follow the predictions of standard economic models that assume people make rational choices about spending money to "maximize their total satisfaction."&lt;ref name="BogleheadsGuide"/&gt;

Many behavioral pitfalls are based on the finding that investors are risk averse. They dislike losses almost twice as much as they like comparable gains and may take on more risk hoping to avoid a loss than realize a gain. They may also abandon a sound strategy under the stress of a loss. Consider this carefully this when choosing your all-important asset allocation.

You may not sense risk-aversion bias when an asset allocation is made. It will, however, present itself during a market downturn or crash, when the emotional stress of a loss can cause panic. If your asset allocation was not properly based on your risk tolerance, your are likely to abandon the market and sell low.

===History===
Many ideas now accepted in behavioral economics can be traced back to groundbreaking contributions by mathematician Daniel Bernoulli, ''New Theory on the Measurement of Risk'' (1738),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=[Exposition of a New Theory on the Measurement of Risk]| date=1954| journal=Econometrica | volume=22 |pages=23–36| url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/1909829| doi=10.2307/1909829| accessdate=June 1, 2023}} English translation of Bernoulli, D., "Specimen Theoriae Novae de Mensura Sortis", (1738).&lt;/ref&gt; and philosopher Adam Smith, ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments'' (1759).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.ibiblio.org/ml/libri/s/SmithA_MoralSentiments_p.pdf| title=The Theory of Moral Sentiments| author=Adam Smith| accessdate=June 1, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; The key to these early works was their elements of psychology, but psychology was subsequently rejected by economists at the turn of the 20th century because they thought it provided too unsteady a foundation for economics.

In the second half of the 20th century, several researchers challenged the dismissal of psychology as a branch of economics. George Katona, Harvey Leibenstein, Tibor Scitovsky, and Herbert Simon wrote books and articles suggesting the importance of psychological measures and bounds on rationality. They attracted attention, but did not alter the fundamental direction of economics. Additional work by M. Allais (1953),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=M.

===Prospect theory===
The final step in the advancement of behavioral economics as a significant field of economic research is often thought to have started with the work of psychologists [[Daniel Kahneman]] and Amos Tversky. They began their joint work in 1969, and the excellent working relationship ultimately led to the publishing of their seminal paper, ''Prospect Theory'', ten years later.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, (1979).

Amos Tversky died in 1996. Daniel Kahneman received the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences for his work in 2002.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;For more, see [https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/2002/ NobelPrize.org]:

===Prospect theory and the individual investor===
{{Quotation|The investor’s chief problem - and even his worst enemy - is likely to be himself.|Ben Graham}} 

Prospect theory is important because it brings awareness to the common and costly pitfalls that frequently trip up investors. There are two ways pitfalls arise: heuristics and cognitive biases.

Heuristics are mental shortcuts people use for processing complex information. The process falls back on experience by trial and error, rule of thumb, or common sense. While heuristics provide a fast decision, often those decisions are faulty when applied to investing. Anchoring is a heuristic.

Cognitive bias describes inherent thinking errors that humans make in processing information. When investors act on a bias, they do not explore the full issue and can be ignorant of evidence that contradicts their initial opinions. Confirmation bias is an example of cognitive bias.&lt;ref name="confirm" /&gt;

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a way to improve the after-tax return of your taxable investments.

One advantage of taxable accounts is that you can use losses that inevitably occur in some years to lower your tax bill. This is called tax loss harvesting. There are three benefits.

First, tax losses are effectively an interest-free loan which defers capital gains taxes you would otherwise owe into the distant future, and can even eliminate them entirely when you die.

Second, after offsetting realized gains, you can use any remaining tax losses to deduct $3,000 from your ordinary income each year. This can mean an extra $750 or more in your pocket if you are in the 25 percent federal tax bracket.

Third, you can roll over any remaining losses into later years, so that you can defer your capital gains and deduct up to $3,000 from your income, each year until you have used up your losses.

== Overview ==
Suppose that you had invested $10,000 into a [[mutual fund]] in a taxable account, but after a steep decline your holdings are now worth only $6,000. Because you plan to continue holding that fund, you might consider ignoring the losses and waiting for the fund to eventually recover.

Instead, using tax loss harvesting, you would sell the fund, and then buy it back [[Wash sale|31 days later]]. In the meantime, you can either hold the cash in a [[Money markets|money market]] fund, or invest it in a similar but not substantially identical fund. This realizes a $4,000 capital loss, but putting you back in your original position 31 days later.

This $4,000 capital loss is valuable in several ways.

Before you pay any capital gains taxes each year, you must use your capital losses to offset any capital gains, and pay taxes only if you have more gains than losses. Short term losses first offset short term gains and long term losses first offset long term gains. If there are any losses left, short term losses offset remaining long term gains or long term losses offset remaining short term gains. If there are any losses left, you must apply up to $3,000 of your remaining capital losses against your regular income. And whatever capital losses are still left over (in this case, $1,000, which is the $4,000 in losses minus the $3,000 deduction) you must carry forward indefinitely into future years.

Each year, you must first apply the carried forward losses against capital gains, and then use any remainder (up to $3,000) to reduce your ordinary income.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Tax loss carryover to the following year is mandatory. See this {{Forum link | t= 318312 | title = If you TLH, do you have to apply it that tax year? | author = geospatial | date = June 22, 2020 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Using tax loss harvesting to offset capital gains does not eliminate the capital gains taxes you would have paid. Instead, it defers those taxes into the future. In this example, you will owe more capital gains taxes in the future because you bought back the fund at a cost basis that is $4,000 lower.

However, because future money is worth less than money today, there is a saying in public finance that "a tax deferred is a tax avoided". Using tax loss harvesting to defer capital gains taxes is like receiving an interest-free loan from the IRS.

Also, if you (and your spouse) are still holding the shares when you die, your heirs will receive a stepped-up basis, and you will have had the up-front benefit from tax loss harvesting while avoiding the taxes on the back end entirely.

Finally, the extra capital gains you owe in the (possibly distant) future will be at the (lower) capital gains rate, while the benefit you receive today of the $3,000 deduction is at your (higher) marginal income tax rate.

==How it works==

Tax loss harvesting works in several different ways. Some examples are shown below.

===Investing a single sum===

* '''January 2008:''' You invest $10,000 in Total Stock Market.
* '''February 2008:''' The balance drops to $9,000. You sell it.
* '''March 2008:''' You put $9,000 back into Total Stock Market. (Suppose that the share price is the same as in February, 2008 for simplicity.)
* '''February 2009:''' You do your 2008 tax return. Because you have lost $1,000, you can reduce your ordinary income by $1,000, assuming you do not have any capital gains. If you are in the 25% bracket for example, you reduce your tax liability by $250. So, you invest the saving, $250, in Total Stock Market.

Suppose Total Stock Market keeps growing 8% year for 10 years after February, 2008.

* '''January 2018:''' $10,000, which dropped to $9,000 in 2008, becomes $19,430.32 (= $9,000 * 1.08^10). $250 becomes $499.75 (= 250 * 1.08^9). Both of these combined, you have $19,930.07. You sell all shares and pay 15% tax on long-term capital gains. You end up with:

 $9,000+($19,430.32-$9,000)*85%+$250+($499.75-$250)*85% = $18,328.05

What if you did not sell Total Stock Market in February, 2008? Note that you do not get $250 back in your 2008 tax return in 2009, so you end up with:

 $10,000+($19,430.32-$10,000)*85% = $18,015.77

Notice the $312.29 difference. This is what you get by investing $250 doing a tax loss harvesting. Obviously, the longer you hold shares you purchased with the $250 refund, the more benefit you get.

In this example, you got two types of benefits; you paid less in total tax, and the tax which you did owe was paid much later. When you deducted the $1,000 loss at a 25% rate, you created an additional $1,000 in capital gains to be taxed when you sold later (2018 in this example), but only at 15%. Essentially, the IRS paid you $100 of free money, and gave you an interest-free loan of another $150 in 2009 to be paid back only when you sold the stock. You benefited both from investing the $100 for its full value, and from the interest-free loan which allowed you to invest the $150 for ten years and pay back only the original $150.

In reality, things are a bit more complicated. In the above example, we completely ignored dividends from Total Stock Market. Also, the share price may change between February 2008 and March 2008.

===Using a loss from one tax lot to offset the capital gains from another===

Suppose the following:

* '''January 2008:''' You invest $1,000,000 in Total Stock Market.
* '''February 2008:''' You tax loss harvest after losing $100,000.
* '''January 2010:''' You invest additional $50,000 in Total Stock Market.
* '''January 2011:''' You retire. You sell the shares purchased in January 2010, which has grown to $60,000.

In 2011, you have not used up the loss realized in February 2008 as you can only deduct $3,000/year, so you can use a part of the remaining loss to offset the capital gain realized in January 2011.

If $60,000 is enough for your living expenses, you may have little or no taxable income because the gain is offset by the realized loss carryforward, and the return of capital, $50,000, is tax free. If this is the case, you might consider [http://www.fairmark.com/rothira/post.htm Post-Retirement Roth Conversion] to take advantage of the standard/itemized deduction and low tax brackets.

===Donating low basis shares to a charity===

Suppose the following:

* '''January 2008:''' You invest $10,000 in Total Stock Market.
* '''February 2008:''' You tax loss harvest after losing $1,000.
* '''March 2008:''' You reinvest $9,000 in Total Stock Market.
* '''January 2009 and on:''' You make many purchases of shares of Total Stock Market.
* '''January 2020:''' You donate the shares purchased in March 2008 to a charity.

If you donate the shares purchased in March 2008 to a charity, you do not have to pay tax on the capital gains. That is, you keep the full tax savings in 2008 and never "pay back" the savings to the IRS. See [[Donating appreciated securities]] for more details.

===Stepped up cost basis upon death===
{{Main |Step-up in basis}}

Suppose the following:

* '''January 2008:''' You invest $10,000 in Total Stock Market.
* '''February 2008:''' You tax loss harvest after losing $1,000.
* '''March 2008:''' You reinvest $9,000 in Total Stock Market.
* '''January 2009 and on:''' You make many purchases of shares of Total Stock Market.
* '''January 2020:''' You retire and start withdrawing from your taxable account, highest cost basis first.

Perhaps do not sell shares purchased in your life time, in which case, the shares purchased in March 2008 receive stepped up cost basis upon your death. That is, you keep the full tax savings in 2008 and never "pay back" the savings to the IRS.

==What if the tax rates go up in the future?==

Some people speculate that the tax rates may go up in the future. Tax loss harvesting still works as long as the increase is reasonable. Specifically, you benefit from tax loss harvesting as long as the tax you pay on the $1,000 extra capital gains ($10,000 - $9,000) in the first example above is less than the after-tax amount that $250 grows to.

Suppose the long-term capital gain tax rate goes up to 30%. Then you would pay $300 on the $1,000 extra capital gains. However, $250 grows to $499.75 with the after-tax amount being $424.83, so you are not losing money yet.

==Fine points about tax loss harvesting==

===Regulatory===

* '''[[Wash sale]]'''. If you sell Total Stock Market for a loss, while still holding other shares of the same fund purchased within the past 30 days, or purchase shares of the same fund within 30 days after the sale, that would be called a wash sale, and you cannot claim the losses on your tax return. The definition of a wash sale is a bit more complicated than that. Before you tax loss harvest, be sure to familiarize yourself with the [http://www.fairmark.com/capgain/wash/ wash sale rule].
* '''[[Qualified dividend|Qualified dividends]]'''. If you hold shares for fewer than 61 days and receive qualified dividends from those shares, you cannot take them as qualified dividends, even though the fund company may state that they are qualified. Receiving dividends that are not qualified may outweigh the benefit of tax loss harvesting.
* '''Loss on mutual fund shares held 6 months or less'''. If you sell shares of a mutual fund at a loss, and you have held those shares for 6 months or less, special rules may alter the loss you claim. First, if those shares produced any tax-exempt interest, your loss is reduced, dollar for dollar, by that interest. Second, if you held those shares while the fund distributed (long term) capital gains, you have to treat this loss as a long term loss up to the dollar amount of the distribution those shares produced.&lt;ref name="pub550"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/publications/p550| title=Publication 550, Investment Income and Expenses| publisher=IRS| accessdate=August 29, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{forum link| t=173117| title=Corrections for the wiki article on TLH| date=September 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vanguard (and probably most other brokerages) will not adjust your IRS Form 1099-B, so you will have to correct it yourself by filing Form 8949 and changing the type of capital loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{forum link| t=273200| title=TLH holding period not met for LTCG distributions; how to report?| date=February 17, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:However, [[Exchange-traded funds | ETF]]s and the [{{Vf|vteax}} Tax-Exempt Bond Index Fund] (which is the mutual fund class of an ETF) ''are'' subject to the six-month rule, because they declare dividends monthly, not daily. To see whether a fund is exempt from the six-month rule, check its prospectus for "dividends are declared daily and paid monthly". If it says "dividends are declared monthly" (or quarterly), the six-month rule applies.
*'''Death of taxpayer'''. Capital losses cannot be carried over after a taxpayer's death. You deduct them only on the final income tax return filed on the decedent's behalf.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/publications/p544| title=Publication 544 (2022), Sales and Other Dispositions of Assets| publisher=IRS| accessdate=August 29, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Operational===

* '''Reinvesting dividends and capital gains'''. If you automatically reinvest dividends and capital gains, you may accidentally trigger a [[wash sale]]. If you plan to tax loss harvest, it is generally safer to take dividends and capital gain distributions in cash.
* '''Cost basis accounting'''. Use [[Specific identification of shares]] instead of average cost basis to sell shares with losses.
* '''Put volatile investments in your taxable account'''. For example, an international fund is more volatile because of political and currency risks. This makes it more likely you will be able to tax loss harvest.
* '''Commissions and [[bid/ask spread]]s'''. If you are tax loss harvesting ETFs or individual stocks, you may have to pay commissions and bid/ask spreads, and these erode the tax loss harvesting benefits. Compare the amount of tax you save to trading costs, and tax loss harvest only when the trading costs are minimal compared to your tax saving.
* '''Mutual funds'''. You do not face commissions or bid-ask spreads. However, some mutual funds have [[Redemption fee | redemptions fees]] for a certain period after the purchase. Another problem is that you could try to realize a small loss in a mutual fund position, but the loss may disappear by the time the redemption completes. Consider tax loss harvesting on a sizable loss that is unlikely to disappear in one day.
* '''Frequent-trading restrictions'''. Vanguard does not allow you to sell most funds and buy back into the same fund electronically within 30 days.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;There are some exceptions. For details, see [https://investor.vanguard.com/investor-resources-education/online-trading/trading-violations-penalties Trading violations and penalties] from Vanguard.&lt;/ref&gt; If you plan to buy the fund back within 31 days, do one of the two transactions by mail.
* '''Investment volatility'''. If you wait 31 days to reinvest you will usually see volatility in the investment. If the price of the investment goes up while you are in cash you lose, but if it goes down you gain. You might expect that over a long period of tax harvesting these volatility effects might wash out (if random) or perhaps, if there is a short term momentum effect, a slight advantage to tax loss harvesting over the long haul. You can however mitigate this if you immediately purchase a similar, but not substantially identical investment. However doing this makes your investing more complicated, especially if you are swapping fractional lots of the original fund.

==Should I tax loss harvest before or after a distribution?==
The general rule is to sell before and buy after a [[dividend]] and [[capital gains distribution]].
More important is to buy after the distribution; if you sell Fund A to buy Fund B, you want to wait until after Fund B makes a large distribution, even if you receive a distribution from Fund A.

The reason is that you pay tax on any distribution, but every dollar of distribution reduces the fund's NAV by one dollar, so you get a tax benefit from this dollar as a capital loss (or reduced gain) if you sell. When you are selling Fund A to tax loss harvest, you will always get the capital loss. If you buy Fund B, you do not get any benefit from the capital loss until you sell. Even if you intend to switch back immediately, if Fund B pays a [[qualified dividend]], you need to hold Fund B for 61 days rather than 31 or else the dividend loses its qualified status, and waiting 61 days increases the potential cost of switching back.

You usually want to tax loss harvest before a distribution as long as you need not buy the replacement fund before its distribution, but it depends on the type of distribution.

If the distribution is a capital-gains distribution, then it is exactly canceled by the capital loss, so there is no net tax effect. If the distribution is an [[ordinary dividend]] then it has increased taxes at the marginal tax rate, and the capital loss is likely to give less in tax savings. If the distribution is a qualified dividend and the capital loss offsets long-term gains, this is break-even because the qualified dividend and reduced capital gain are taxed at the same rate. If the distribution is a qualified dividend and the capital loss offsets short-term gains or ordinary income, there is a benefit for waiting. And if the distribution is a mostly qualified dividend with [[foreign tax credit]], you may pay tax at less than the long-term gains rate, and should wait for the distribution before harvesting the loss.

==When not to harvest losses==
When you sell at a loss you will either offset capital gains which would have otherwise been taxed at your capital gains rate or you will offset income (up to $3,000 maximum per year) which would have otherwise been taxed at your marginal income tax rate, or both.

If you offset capital gains that would have otherwise not been taxed at all (because your capital gains tax rate is 0%) then this part of the tax loss harvest may be an outright loss. Here is why:

You can think of tax loss harvesting as a loan from the IRS in the following sense. If you reinvest the funds from the the sale in the same or similar securities (after waiting 31 days if necessary to avoid a wash sale), then the transactions give you a lower basis. Ultimately, if the asset price of that security increases you will pay taxes on capital gains when you sell. As a result, the tax loss harvesting tax benefit may ultimately result in a higher capital gains tax rate in a future year than you might have otherwise faced. So, if tax loss harvesting offsets capital gains that would have been taxed at 0% but your future capital gains rate is not 0% then it has created a loss. Put simply, you get no benefit from offsetting capital gains that are not taxed anyway.

Bottom line: know your tax rates before you tax loss harvest.

==What if the stock is worthless?==
If a company fails, the IRS imposes different rules.&lt;ref name="pub550" /&gt;

Stocks, stock rights, and bonds (other than those held for sale by a securities dealer) that became completely worthless during the tax year are treated as though they were sold on the last day of the tax year. This affects whether your capital loss is long term or short term.

Report worthless securities on IRS [https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-8949 Form 8949], Part I or Part II, whichever applies. You may need to file an amended return to report a stock which became worthless in a prior year.&lt;ref&gt;{{forum link| p=2058878| title=Re: How to Recognize Capital Loss| date=May 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{for|additional information|wikipedia:Roth IRA}}

A '''Roth IRA''' is a personal savings plan, a type of [[IRA|Individual Retirement Arrangement (IRA)]], which allows you to set aside money for retirement while offering you tax advantages. In simple terms, a Roth IRA allows you to make contributions for which you get no up-front tax deduction, but once money is in the account, it grows tax-free and is also tax-free when you withdraw it (subject to a few restrictions described below). Compared to other retirement accounts, the Roth IRA offers unusual flexibility, in that contributions can ''always'' be withdrawn tax- and penalty-free, and like all Roth accounts, the Roth IRA has no [[Required Minimum Distribution|Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs)]]. Like all IRAs, Roth IRAs are individual accounts and cannot be jointly owned. 

The Roth IRA stands in contrast to the [[traditional IRA]], where contributions may be tax-deductible (subject to income limits) and growth is tax-deferred, but withdrawals are taxable. Roth and traditional IRAs share the same annual contribution limit, currently $7,000 (or $8,000 for those age 50+). The choice of whether to contribute to a [[Traditional versus Roth|traditional or Roth]] accounts can be a complex tax-planning decision.

Named after US Senator William Roth, Roth IRAs were established by the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Taxpayer Relief Act Of 1997--Conference Report|url=https://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/7/31/senate-section/article/S8415-1|accessdate=Sep 17, 2009|date=July 31, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages==

*Roth IRAs offer life-long tax-free growth on invested money. Compared to a [[Taxable account|taxable]] brokerage account where you pay tax on interest, dividends, and capital gains, a Roth IRA can offer significant tax savings, increasing the amount of money available to spend in retirement.
*Contributions can be withdrawn at any time tax- and penalty-free, a unique feature among retirement accounts which adds great flexibility. A Roth IRA can even be used to hold an [[Roth IRA as an emergency fund|emergency fund]]. 
*The tax-free structure gives you valuable space to hold [[Tax-efficient fund placement|tax-inefficient investments]], and lets you buy and sell investments for [[rebalancing]] or changing your portfolio without incurring capital gains tax.
*It is easy to find Roth IRAs with a wide selection of great investment and very low fees. 
*Unlike [[Employer retirement plans overview|employer retirement plans]] (like a [[401(k)]]), an IRA is under your complete control; an employer can't change the plan rules or investments, or add fees. 
*Although there are [[#Contribution_eligibility_and_limits|income limits]] for direct contributions, in most cases these limits can be circumvented with the [[Backdoor Roth IRA]] process.
*The contribution limit is separate from any employer plans; you can contribute up to the maximum to both accounts. The Roth IRA pairs well with a traditional employer plan, offering extra tax-advantaged space and [[Traditional_versus_Roth#Tax_diversification|tax diversification]] to mid/high-earners.
*Contributions are eligible for the [[Saver's credit]] for lower-income investors.
*Like all Roth accounts, Roth IRAs have no [[Required Minimum Distribution|Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs)]]
*Money in a Roth IRA gets more [[asset protection]] than a brokerage account; some or all of the value may be protected from creditors or bankruptcy, depending on the laws in your state.
*[[Estate planning]] benefits - money can be left to heirs easily via designated beneficiaries (avoiding [[probate]]), and non-spouse heirs generally get an additional [[Stretch IRA|ten years]] of tax-free growth before they have to empty the account.

==Disadvantages==

*Earnings on investments cannot be withdrawn before age 59½ without paying taxes and penalties, although the penalty can be waived if any of certain exceptions apply.
*Many investors in their peak earnings year should probably prefer [[Traditional versus Roth|traditional investments to Roth]], meaning they should contribute to a [[traditional IRA]] (if their income allows those contributions to be deducted) and/or a traditional employer plan (if the investments and fees are good) before a Roth IRA.
*Compared to an ERISA-governed employer plan, which gets excellent [[asset protection]] at the federal level, the Roth IRA only gets state-level protection, which may be much worse. Even if you live in a state with good asset protection for a Roth IRA, there is a chance you may later move.
*For high-earners, contributing through the [[Backdoor Roth IRA]] process adds some extra complexity and opportunities for mistakes. Backdoor Roth IRA mistakes are a common question on the [https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/index.php Bogleheads forum].

==Traditional versus Roth==
{{main|Traditional versus Roth}}

There are two basic types of IRAs, [[Traditional_IRA|traditional]] and Roth. The table below reviews some of the differences between the two account structures.

* Penalty free withdrawals can begin at age 59½ and are mandatory by age 73, increasing to age 75 for those born in 1960 or later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=26 U.S. Code § 401(a)(9)(C)(v) - Qualified pension, profit-sharing, and stock bonus plans|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/401#a_9_C_v|accessdate=August 29, 2025|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt; You can also make penalty free withdrawals with a defined series of [[Substantially equal periodic payments]] from an IRA.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Taxes are paid on earnings when withdrawn from the IRA.
* Withdrawals before age 59½ are subject to a 10% penalty (subject to exceptions).
* Contributions made to a Traditional IRA qualify for the Retirement Savings Contributions Credit ([[Saver's credit|Saver's Credit]]) if you meet the filing and income requirements.&lt;ref name="pub571"&gt; {{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/publications/p571/ch10.html| title=Retirement Savings Contributions Credit (Saver's Credit), Publication 571| publisher=IRS| accessdate=August 29, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

|&lt;!--- 2nd column ---&gt;
* Contributions may be made only by those having compensation and making under a certain income; anyone can [[#Conversion to Roth IRA|convert]] a Traditional IRA to a Roth. Contributions are not tax-deductible.
* Principal contributions (but not earnings) can be withdrawn at any time without penalty (subject to some minimal conditions).
* After age 59½, all earnings and principal are tax free (subject to some minimal conditions).
* There is no mandatory distribution age for the account owner, or in the case of a spousal rollover.
* Contributions made to a Roth IRA qualify for the Retirement Savings Contributions Credit ([[Saver's credit|Saver's Credit]]) if you meet the filing and income requirements.&lt;ref name="pub571" /&gt; 
|}

As a general rule of thumb, the decision as to which IRA an investor elects to use is a function of expected present and future tax rates. Thus a traditional IRA should be considered if the present [[marginal tax rate]] is expected to be higher than the future marginal rate at distribution; The Roth IRA should be considered if the present marginal tax rate is expected to be lower than the future marginal rate at distribution. If the outlook for tax rates is uncertain, you should consider diversifying contributions (or conversions) between the two account types. A Roth IRA may also be a strong candidate for consideration if the account is used as an estate planning tool. For the original account owner (and spousal inheritors) there are no required minimum distributions to deplete the account for subsequent beneficiaries. If you face estate tax a Roth conversion can produce tax savings to the estate since the income tax paid on the conversion both reduces the estate and renders tax savings since the income tax rate is lower than the estate tax rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author1=Maria A.

Unlike traditional [[Employer retirement plans overview|employer retirement plans]] which have no income limits for contribution, the relatively low [[Traditional_IRA#Contribution_and_income_limits|income limits]] for the traditional IRA diminishes its utility for most high- and even mid-income earners. If you are phased out of deducting traditional IRA contributions, contributing to a Roth IRA is almost always better the alternative, making [[Non-deductible traditional IRA|non-deductible]] contributions to a traditional IRA. The Roth IRA has income limits too (see below), but in most cases they can be circumvented via the [[Backdoor Roth IRA]] process.

==Contribution eligibility and limits==

As of 2025, the annual combined contribution limit for all traditional and Roth IRAs is '''$7,500''', or '''$8,600''' if you are age 50 or older. This limit is separate from any employer plans, including a [[401(k)]], [[403(b)]], [[SEP|SEP-IRA]], and [[SIMPLE IRA]]. The table below shows historical maximum annual Roth contribution limits.

Your ability to contribute to a Roth IRA is limited depending on your filing status and the level of your "modified adjusted gross income". These income limits change year to year due to inflation adjustment. You can find these income limits in [https://www.irs.gov/publications/p590a/ch02.html IRS Publication 590-A: Roth IRAs] Your modified AGI for Roth IRA purposes is your adjusted gross income (AGI) as shown on your tax return modified as follows;

Most investors are able to circumvent these income limits via the [[Backdoor Roth IRA]] process.   This process entails (1) making a non-deducted contribution to a traditional IRA, and (2) shortly thereafter, [[Roth conversion|converting]] that money to a Roth IRA. These two steps have the same net effect as a direct Roth IRA contribution, but neither has an income limit.

IRA contributions are also limited by the amount of your compensation. Compensation includes wages, salaries, commissions, self-employment income, taxable alimony and separate maintenance, nontaxable combat pay, taxable non-tuition fellowship and stipend payments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Publication 590-A (2021), Contributions to Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs)|url=https://www.irs.gov/publications/p590a|access-date=February 19, 2022|website=Internal Revenue Service|series="Who Can Open a Traditional IRA?" and Table 1-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The total amount you can contribute to your IRAs cannot be greater than the amount of your compensation for the year of the contribution. For married couples filing jointly, the compensation of either spouse can be used to make the contributions to each person’s IRAs. It makes no difference which spouse has the compensation, but the total compensation cannot be less than the total of the IRA contributions for both individuals.

If you are working for someone else, compensation will be reported in Box 1 of your W-2. If you are working for a business you own, your compensation is the net income reported on the Schedule C less 50% of the self-employment taxes you pay. Other types of income do not fit the definition of compensation and cannot be used for Roth IRA contributions (except for commissions and taxable alimony and separate maintenance). 

===Roth IRA for children===
{{Main article|Accounts for children}}

Parents sometimes wonder if it is okay to contribute to a Roth IRA for their children. As stated above, it is necessary to have compensation in order to contribute to an IRA (Traditional or Roth). Children can obtain compensation by working for a business, as a household employee (for example, babysitting, mowing lawns, etc), or through self-employment. Very young children have few options for legitimate work, but can perform acting or modeling. There are advantages for parents with businesses to hire their children in appropriate jobs, but need to be careful to avoid paying children for household chores through their business. Parents should be aware that a child who has self-employment income over $400 must pay self-employment taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-utl/OC-Whateverystudentshouldknowaboutsummerjobsandtaxes.pdf| title=What every student should know about summer jobs and taxes| publisher=IRS| accessdate=May 26, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, for many jobs that children may have, they would be classified as household employees, rather than self-employed, and would not be subject to employment taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p926.pdf| title=Household Employer's Tax Guide| publisher=IRS| accessdate=December 11, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; While there are proponents for parents paying their children for household chores and using that compensation as the basis for Roth IRA contributions, others, including the Tax Court, take a dim view of considering parents and children in an employer/employee relationship regarding household chores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://fairmark.com/retirement/roth-accounts/contributions-to-roth-accounts/roth-iras-for-minors/| title=Roth IRAs for Minors| publisher=Fairmark| author=Kaye A.

==Conversion to Roth IRA==
{{Main|Roth conversion}}
{{Notice|Recharacterization of Roth IRA conversions made in 2018 or later are no longer permitted.}}

Roth conversions from a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA require you to pay the tax due (without an early withdrawal penalty) on any previously untaxed Traditional IRA assets converted. In general, conversions work best when you are in a low tax bracket and when the source of funds for paying the tax are available outside of the IRA. If the tax is paid out of the converted assets, the payment may be considered an early distribution and is subject to both income tax and, if you are under age 59½, a 10% early withdrawal penalty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Natalie Choate| title=Life and Death Planning for Retirement Benefits| edition=6th| p=247| isbn=0-9649440-7-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since new conversion rules were implemented in 2010, there have been no income limits or filing status requirements for converting a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA. In 2010 alone, investors were given the option of paying the taxes on the conversion either all in 2010 or in equal amounts in 2011 and 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/publications/p590/ch02.html#en_US_publink1000230961| title=Publication 590 (2009), Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs)| publisher=IRS}}{{dead link}} Applies for any 2010 rollover from an IRA, except from Roth IRA to Roth IRA.&lt;/ref&gt; Investors whose incomes exceed the limits for allowing contributions to a Roth IRA should consider the option of contributing to a [[Non-deductible Traditional IRA]] and executing a [[Backdoor Roth IRA]].

For the tax consequences of taking a distribution of converted assets see [[#Distributions Roth IRA | Distributions]] below.

If you wish to undo a conversion done in 2017 or earlier, you do so by executing an '''[[IRA recharacterization]]'''. Undoing a conversion might result from finding that:
*You are in a higher tax bracket than intended, possibly from increased income near the end of the year.
*You find that you do not have sufficient funds to pay the conversion tax.
*The market value of the converted assets has fallen in price after the conversion and you can save on taxes by recharacterizing the conversion and then, in accordance with IRS restrictions, reconverting the assets at the lower value.

==Distributions==

The amounts you withdraw from a Roth IRA are considered to come out of the account in the following order of categories, each with its own tax consequences:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.kitces.com/blog/understanding-the-two-5-year-rules-for-roth-ira-contributions-and-conversions| title=Understanding The Two 5-Year Rules For Roth IRA Contributions And Conversions| author=Michael Kitces| date=January 1, 2014| accessdate=June 19, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#Regular contributions 
#Taxable portion of first conversion (portion that was taxed at time of conversion)
#Nontaxable portion of first conversion 
#Each subsequent conversion, in chronological order but with conversions aggregated by calendar year, with the taxable portion coming out first for each conversion 
#Earnings (any increase in value occurring inside the Roth IRA)&lt;ref name="Fairmark_Distribution"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.fairmark.com/rothira/distrib.htm| title=Roth IRA Distribution Overview| publisher=Fairmark| author=Kaye A. Thomas| date=February 11, 2018| accessdate=June 19, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=April 5, 2023|title=Publication 590-B (2022), Distributions from Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs)|url=https://www.irs.gov/publications/p590b#en_US_2022_publink100089915|access-date=May 15, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Note that conversions are quantized and aggregated by calendar year. For example, if you did three conversions in a given calendar year, then later take distributions in excess of your contributions, you would first distribute the total taxable amount of those three conversions, then the total nontaxable amount, then move on to subsequent calendar years.

The tax treatment is summarized in the following table, from information supplied by KAWill (Fairmark). A "Qualified" distribution incurs no federal tax or penalty.

===Details===

Details on the categories of assets are as follows:
#Regular contributions can be withdrawn at any time with no tax and no penalty. This category includes your life-long direct contributions, plus any elective deferrals you have rolled in from a designated Roth account.
#Taxable portion of a conversion applies only when the lifetime total of withdrawals from all Roth IRAs exceeds the lifetime total of regular contributions to Roth IRAs plus the lifetime total of earlier conversions.
##If withdrawn before the first day of the fifth year after the year of the conversion: no tax, but will be subject to 10% early withdrawal penalty if you are under age 59½ unless an exception applies.{{#tag:ref|Exceptions to the early withdrawal penalty tax on converted assets include total disability, or death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Natalie Choate| title=Life and Death Planning for Retirement Benefits| edition=6th| page=248| isbn=0-9649440-7-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group="note"}}
##Beginning on the first day of the fifth year after the year of the conversion can be withdrawn at any time with no tax and no penalty. 
##Special rules apply to withdrawals of amounts converted in 2010. 
#Nontaxable portion of any rollover
##Applies only after the taxable portion of the same conversion has been withdrawn.
##Can be withdrawn at any time with no tax and no penalty. 
#Earnings
##Applies only after all amounts other than earnings have been withdrawn.
##If withdrawn before the first day of the fifth year after the year you first established a Roth IRA, taxable as ordinary income; also subject to the 10% early withdrawal penalty if you are under age 59½ unless an exception applies. 
##Beginning on the first day of the fifth year after the year you first established a Roth IRA, can be withdrawn with no tax and no penalty if you are over age 59½ or otherwise meet the requirements for a qualified distribution (death, disability, first-time homeowner). Otherwise, withdrawals of earnings continue to be taxable as ordinary income and, unless an exception applies, subject to the 10% early withdrawal penalty.&lt;ref name="Fairmark_Distribution" /&gt;

===Rollovers from designated Roth accounts===

When you roll in money into a Roth IRA from a designated Roth account (like a [[401(k)#Roth_401(k)|Roth 401(k)]]) and later take a distribution, some special rules apply:&lt;ref&gt;{{forum link| t=460217| title=Roth 401(k) rollover resets 5-year rule}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*When you roll in money consisting of direct Roth contributions (elective deferrals), that amount gets added to the "contributions" bucket, and can therefore be withdrawn anytime tax- and penalty-free. This amount gets reported to you in Box 5 of the [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1099r.pdf Form 1099-R] for the rollover. 
**Any earnings you roll in goes into the "earnings" bucket, and comes out last, but possibly subject to taxes and penalties. 
*When you roll money in from an [[After-tax 401(k)]], for example as part of a [[Mega-backdoor Roth]], it behaves the same way as a Roth conversion from an IRA - the taxable (if any) and nontaxable portions come out in chronological order with respect to other conversions. 
*When you roll money in that was previously moved into a designed Roth account via an In-plan Roth Rollover (IRR), that is considered a converted amount on the date of the original IRR, and the taxable and nontaxable (if any) portions come out after earlier converted amounts.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;There is a complication with this rule, as described by forum member Alan S.: "There's an IRS design problem however with respect to distributing the amount from an IRR after rolling to a Roth IRA. The problem is that the IRS 8606 instructions indicate that IRRs be reported on line 22 of Form 8606. If that is done, then the penalty recapture chart (Appendix C in Pub 590 B) produces an incorrect result in favor of the taxpayer who then escapes the recapture tax on Form 5329. The IRS has allowed this disconnect to exist for 14 years now, which illustrates that Appendix C is not on their radar. No telling how tax software addresses this, but it's most likely designed to follow the 8606 Inst. The recommended fix for this problem is to not include IRRs on line 22 of Form 8606 as the instructions indicate. Put them on line 24 instead where Roth conversions go. If you do that then Appendix C will work as clearly intended by the IRS in [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-10-84.pdf Notice 2010-84].&lt;/ref&gt;

When a Roth IRA is ''qualified'' - that is, when the owner is at least 59½ or disabled, and has had a Roth IRA for at least 5 years - all withdrawals are tax- and penalty-free, including any money once rolled in from a designated Roth account (such as a Roth 401k).

===Early distributions===

The table above shows there can be tax consequences to taking distributions from a Roth IRA prior to age 59½ or before the Roth has been held for a minimum of five years for both contributions as well as for each Roth conversion. Furthermore, there may be state-specific rules regarding non-qualified distributions. For example, in New Jersey, non-qualified withdrawals from a Roth IRA are treated as proportional withdrawals of contributions and gains, so tax and penalty would be due on the gain portion.&lt;ref&gt;{{forum link| p=5388305| title=Roth IRA Idea: Burst my bubble}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.state.nj.us/treasury/taxation/pdf/pubs/tgi-ee/git2.pdf| title=IRA Withdrawals| publisher=New Jersey Tax Topic Bulletin GIT-2| accessdate=August 1, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are exceptions to the early withdrawal penalty, such as birth or adoption, disability, disaster recovery, higher education, first-time homebuying, and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/plan-participant-employee/retirement-topics-exceptions-to-tax-on-early-distributions| title=Retirement topics - Exceptions to tax on early distributions| publisher=Internal Revenue Service| accessdate=August 30, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt; Note that while the exceptions can waive the ''penalty'' for early withdrawals, only disability and the first-time home buyer exception also waive the ''tax'' assessed on withdrawing earnings before age 59½, and only if you have had a Roth IRA for at least 5 years.

===Roth 5 year rule summary===

The [https://www.schwab.com/learn/story/what-to-know-about-five-year-rule-roths following article] is a good summary of the various iterations of the 5 year rule, both for personal and designated Roth accounts.

===Inherited Roth IRAs===

While a Roth IRA does not impose [[Required Minimum Distribution|Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs)]] for the original Roth IRA owner, or for a spouse who elects to treat an [[Inheriting a Roth IRA |inherited Roth IRA]] as their own in a spousal rollover, non-spousal inheritors distribution rules vary. Most non-spouse beneficiaries no longer have RMDs, but must distribute the Roth in entirety by the end of the 10th year after death of decedent. Certain exceptions, referred to as Eligible Designated Beneficiaries, are  required to take RMDs of the Roth over their life expectancies.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Minors under 21 are able to use lifetime stretch RMDs until they turn 21, after which no RMDs are required, but then they must liquidate their Roth entirely by the end of the 10th year after their 21st birthday.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{for|additional information|wikipedia:Traditional IRA}}

A '''traditional IRA''' (Individual Retirement Arrangement) is a personal savings plan which allows you to set aside money for retirement, while offering you tax advantages. You may be able to deduct some or all of your contributions to your traditional IRA. Amounts in your IRA, including earnings, generally are not taxed until distributed to you. See [[IRA|the general IRA wiki page]] for information which applies to all types of IRAs, including the traditional IRA.

==Description==

A traditional IRA allows investors to make either deductible (deducted) or non-deductible (not deducted) contributions, at their option. The annual IRA contribution limit of $7,500, or $8,600 for individuals age 50 and over (as of 2026), applies to all deductible and non-deductible traditional IRA contributions and Roth IRA contributions. When you make non-deductible contributions to a traditional IRA, those contributions become after-tax ''basis'' within the account. Deductible contributions and all growth within the account are pre-tax, and therefore taxable as income when withdrawn. The IRS requires all withdrawals (including for Roth conversions) from a traditional IRA to be “pro-rata” between the pre-tax and after-tax portions. For example, if you make a $1,000 withdrawal from a traditional IRA with a balance of $10,000 and a basis of $6,000, the withdrawal will be 60% ($6,000 / $10,000) non-taxable basis and 40% pre-tax. Therefore, the basis would decrease by $600 to $5,400, and $400 of the withdrawal would be considered taxable income. A fully deductible traditional IRA is a special case of a traditional IRA with a basis of 0.  

Growth within a traditional IRA (for example, interest, dividends, and capital gains) is not taxable in the year it is earned. Rather, taxes on growth are fully deferred until withdrawal. This makes a traditional IRA (along with a Roth IRA and [[Employer_retirement_plans_overview|workplace retirement plans]]) a good place to hold [[Tax-efficient fund placement|tax-inefficient investments]] and to perform [[rebalancing]] trades that sell appreciated investments.

Losses from a traditional IRA – when you make a withdrawal when the balance is less than the basis – are ''not'' tax-deductible, unlike with a [[Taxable account|taxable account]]. 

===Contribution and income limits===

The maximum contribution limit for 2025 is $7,000, or $8,000 for those 50 and older; for 2026, it is '''$7,500''', or '''$8,600''' for those age 50 or older.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/401k-limit-increases-to-24500-for-2026-ira-limit-increases-to-7500| title=401(k) limit increases to $24,500 for 2026, IRA limit increases to $7,500| publisher=IRS| accessdate=27 November 2025}}{&lt;/ref&gt;  You cannot contribute more than your compensation for the year. Compensation includes wages, salaries, etc., commissions, self-employment income, taxable alimony and separate maintenance, nontaxable combat pay, taxable non-tuition fellowship and stipend payments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Publication 590-A (2021), Contributions to Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs)|url=https://www.irs.gov/publications/p590a|access-date=February 19, 2022|website=Internal Revenue Service|series="Who Can Open a Traditional IRA?" and Table 1-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Married spouses can also contribute to their own IRAs, even if they did not earn any income. The total contribution for both spouses cannot be greater than the total joint compensation.

Prior to the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SECURE_Act_of_2019 SECURE Act of 2019], traditional IRA owners could not make contributions after age 70½ regardless of whether they had compensation, but this bill removed that restriction. There is now no age limit to contribute to a traditional IRA.

Deduction of contributions to a traditional IRA is subject to limitations according to your [[Traditional IRA#Contribution_Eligibility_and_Limits|Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI)]]:

If you fall inside the phase-out range, the deduction limit is scaled linearly form 100% to 0. For example, a single filer under age 50 with a MAGI of $82,000 would be able deduct up to '''$6,750''' (=$7,500 * ($82,000 - $81,000) / ($91,000 - $81,000) ) of traditional IRA contributions.

For the purposes of traditional IRA contribution deductions, Modified Adjusted Gross Income is defined as Adjusted Gross Income with the following modifications:

===Tracking of basis===
{{See also |Non-deductible traditional IRA#Cost basis |label 1=Non-deductible traditional IRA § Cost basis}}

Financial institutions that hold traditional IRAs do not track the basis. When making a traditional IRA contribution, you do not need to tell the financial institution whether the contribution is deductible or non-deductible. In fact, you do not need to decide whether you want contributions to be deductible until you file your taxes for that tax year.

The basis of your traditional IRA is tracked on [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f8606.pdf IRS Form 8606], which you are required to file with your federal income tax every year your basis changes. The basis of a traditional IRA increases whenever you make non-deductible contributions. The basis decreases whenever you make a traditional IRA withdrawal, or Roth conversion, when you have a non-zero basis.

You are not required to file a Form 8606 for years where your traditional IRA basis doesn’t change, even if the basis is non-zero.

[[File:F8606 2018.png|thumb|right|IRS Form 8606, tax year 2018]]

===The "pro-rata" rule===

Stated simply, the "pro-rata" rule means that withdrawals from a traditional IRA are considered to a mix of pre-tax and after-tax funds, in proportion to the relative sizes of the two balances. The pro-rata rule has some unexpected details. The rule is applied to the combined balance of ALL traditional IRAs, [[SEP|SEP-IRAs]], and [[SIMPLE IRA|SIMPLE IRAs]] that an individual owns. For example, if you have a $10,000 traditional IRA with a $10,000 basis (all non-deductible contributions) and a $90,000 SEP-IRA, a $10,000 withdrawal from the traditional IRA, only 10% ($10,000 / ($10,000 + $90,000)) will be withdrawal of basis and 90% will be taxable. Even though the traditional IRA has a balance of $0 and could even be closed, the remaining $9,000 of basis is effectively transferred to the SEP-IRA. 

The pro-rata rule is applied based on the combined balance of all traditional, SIMPLE, and SEP-IRAs as of December 31st of the year in which the withdrawal is made. This gives the taxpayer some flexibility, for example, to roll over a traditional IRA into a 401k later in the year after making a [[Backdoor Roth IRA]] contribution. 

A spouse’s IRA balances are not considered in the pro-rata calculation. Neither is an inherited traditional IRA. If you have an inherited traditional IRA with a non-zero basis, you will need to file a separate Form 8606 for withdrawals from that IRA. If you are the decedent's spouse, you have the option to combine the traditional IRA with your own, in which case the basis and pre-tax balance would transfer to you, and you would continue to file a single Form 8606.

====Exceptions to the “pro-rata” rule====

There are two exceptions when funds withdrawn from a traditional IRA are not subject to the pro-rata rule:

*When a traditional IRA is rolled into a [[401(k)]] or other [[Employer retirement plans overview|qualified plan]], only the pre-tax portion is rolled over. The non-deductible basis remains within the IRA, which could subsequently be converted to a [[Roth IRA]] tax-free.
*When making [[Qualified charitable distributions|Qualified Charitable Distributions (QCDs)]] from a traditional IRA, only the pre-tax portion is removed, keeping the basis intact.

===Backdoor Roth IRA===
{{Main|Backdoor Roth IRA}}

The Backdoor Roth IRA is a process used to indirectly contribute to a [[Roth IRA]] for taxpayers whose Modified Adjusted Gross Income prevents them from contributing to a Roth IRA directly. There are two steps to a Backdoor Roth IRA:

*Non-deductible contribution to a traditional IRA 
*[[Roth IRA conversion|Conversion]] (usually, shortly thereafter) of the entire traditional IRA to a Roth IRA

The net result of these two transactions is the same as a direct contribution to a Roth IRA. Neither of these two steps has any income limitations, and so taxpayers of any income can make Backdoor Roth IRA contributions. Aside from the complexity, there is no real disadvantage to using the Backdoor process. Due to the pro-rata rule, if you have any other traditional IRAs, SEP-IRAs, or SIMPLE IRAs with pre-tax balances, the Backdoor Roth IRA will not work as intended, and will instead be mostly a conversion of pre-tax IRA balance. For those with an income high enough to need the Backdoor Roth IRA, this will result in a significant tax cost. See the [[Backdoor Roth IRA|main article]] for details.

===Non-deductible traditional IRA===
{{Main|Non-deductible traditional IRA}}

A "Non-deductible traditional IRA" or "Nondeductible IRA" not a separate type of account, but rather results when non-deductible (not deducted) contributions are made to a traditional IRA. Generally, the tax benefits of making non-deductible contributions to a traditional IRA are inferior to either a Roth IRA, or deductible contributions to a traditional IRA. Compared to a [[Taxable account|taxable account]], a Non-deductible IRA has better performance for certain types of investments and worse performance for others, combined with low contribution limits and much less liquidity. Due to the availability of the [[Backdoor Roth IRA]], situations where non-deductible contributions in a traditional IRA make sense are limited. See the [[Non-deductible_traditional_IRA|main article]] for a comparison to other types of accounts, and a performance analysis.

==Rollovers and transfers== 
{{main|IRA rollovers and transfers}}
{{401k rollover infobox}}
A significant amount of traditional IRA assets and annual contributions come from the transfer or rollover of employer retirement plan assets. These  transfer/rollovers occur when an employee severs employment from the employer whether voluntarily through job switching or retiring, or through lay-offs or firings. Employees may wish to transfer an employer plan to a traditional IRA in order to consolidate accounts, reduce plan management expense, or to retain the right to transfer the transferred assets to another employer provided plan. Transfers of traditional IRA accounts occur in three manners:

:*''' Direct Trustee-to-Trustee Transfers'''
:*'''Rollovers'''
:*'''Transfers incident to a divorce''' 

IRA rollovers and transfers can become complicated. Refer to [[IRA Rollovers and Transfers]] for detailed consideration of this topic.

==Required Minimum Distributions==
{{main|Required Minimum Distribution}}

Traditional IRAs have Required Minimum Distributions that generally begin the year the account holder reaches age 73. See the [[Required Minimum Distribution|main page]] for a discussion of the details. 

[[Inheriting an IRA|Inherited IRAs]] (traditional and Roth) inherited prior to January 1, 2020 have Required Minimum Distributions calculated by [http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p590b.pdf IRS Publication 590-B Distribution Table I]. Inherited IRAs inherited ''after'' January 1, 2020 have no RMDs, but must be emptied and closed within ten years of being inherited, unless certain exceptions apply. 

==Penalties for early withdrawals and excess contributions==
===Early withdrawals===

Early withdrawals are generally amounts distributed from your traditional IRA account before you are age 59 1/2. You must pay a 10% additional tax on the distribution of any assets from your traditional IRA before you are age 59 1/2.

:'''Exceptions to the penalty apply if the early withdrawal is:'''
:* made to a beneficiary or estate on account of the IRA owner's death,
:* made on account of disability,
:* made as part of a series of [[SEPP:Substantially_Equal_Periodic_Payments|substantially equal periodic payments]] over your life or life expectancy,
:* made to pay for a qualified first–time home purchase,
:* not above your qualified higher education expenses,
:* not above certain medical insurance premiums paid while unemployed,
:* not above your unreimbursed medical expenses that are more than a certain percentage of your adjusted gross income, or
:* due to an IRS levy.

===Excess contributions===

Contributing more than the allowed amount in any year to your traditional IRA also subjects you to an additional tax. Any excess contribution not withdrawn by the date your tax return for the year is due (including extensions) is subject to a 6% tax. You must pay the 6% tax each year on excess amounts that remain in your traditional IRA at the end of your tax year. Also, any earnings on the excess contribution must be withdrawn as well,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-regs/td9056.pdf |title= IRS Treasury Decision 9056: Earnings Calculation for Returned or Recharacterized IRA Contributions |last= |first= |date= |website= |publisher=Internal Revenue Service (IRS) |accessdate= May 19, 2023 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are taxed as ordinary income.

If you cannot contribute to a [[Roth IRA]] because your income exceeds the income eligibility limit, you can still choose to contribute indirectly through a two step process known informally as the '''backdoor Roth'''.

If you have already made a Roth contribution but now realize your income is too high, the [[IRA_recharacterization|IRA recharacterization]] process allows you to treat that contribution as if it were made to a traditional account instead.

Shown in the figure below, you do the backdoor Roth as follows:

# Make a nondeductible (that is, taxed and not deducted) contribution to a [[traditional IRA]].
# Then [[Roth IRA conversion|convert]] the traditional IRA to a Roth IRA.

The net effect of performing these two steps is equivalent to contributing to a Roth IRA. Because there are no income limits for either of these steps, you can use this backdoor Roth technique to effectively contribute to a Roth IRA regardless of how high your income is. You just need to have compensation in the tax year for which you will be contributing.  Due to the SECURE ACT signed in 2019, there are no longer age limits on IRA contributions. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Benz|first=Christine|date=April 16, 2024|title=You Can Make IRA Contributions at Any Age, but Should You?|url=https://www.morningstar.com/retirement/you-can-make-ira-contributions-any-age-should-you|website=Morningstar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no such IRA called a "backdoor Roth IRA", because the backdoor Roth is a &lt;i&gt;process&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;technique&lt;/i&gt;, not an &lt;i&gt;account&lt;/i&gt;. The IRS does not recognize a "nondeductible traditional IRA", because it is the &lt;i&gt;contributions&lt;/i&gt; that are nondeductible (that is, not deducted), not the &lt;i&gt;IRA&lt;/i&gt;. There is also a &lt;i&gt;process&lt;/i&gt; called [[mega-backdoor Roth]] that is completely different from the backdoor Roth, and they are independent of each other. The IRS does not officially recognize the term "backdoor Roth", and as a result, some tax preparers are not familiar with it either. The term is just a shortcut phrase that investors use. So if you come across someone who has never heard of it, just use the terms "contribute" and "convert" instead, because that is what is really happening.

Before proceeding with a backdoor Roth, consider that it is much easier to contribute directly to a Roth IRA if you are eligible to do so.

==Definitions==
First, there are three terms to understand when doing backdoor Roths:

;Taxable compensation : The IRS defines this as taxable wages, salaries, commissions, self-employment income, alimony and separate maintenance (nontaxable combat pay is also applicable for an IRA contribution). It excludes earnings and profits from property, interest and dividend income, pension or annuity income, deferred compensation, income from certain partnerships, or any amounts (other than combat pay) you exclude from income.&lt;ref name="590A"&gt;{{cite web|title=Publication 590-A (2017), Contributions to Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs)|url=https://www.irs.gov/publications/p590a|accessdate=December 30, 2018|publisher=Internal Revenue Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Traditional IRA : As used on this page, the term refers to each of your non-Roth IRAs, that are also not [[Inheriting an IRA|inherited IRAs]]. These include [[Traditional IRA | traditional IRAs]], [[Rollover IRA | rollover IRAs]] (also known as conduit IRAs), [[SEP | SEP-IRAs]], and [[SIMPLE IRA | SIMPLE IRAs]], including those held at different custodians. The total year-end value of ALL of these accounts will be taken into account when calculating taxes for a backdoor Roth.

; Basis (or cost basis) : This is the total amount of nondeductible contributions in your traditional IRAs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/publications/p590b|title=Publication 590-B (2017), Distributions from Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs)|accessdate=December 11, 2018|publisher=Internal Revenue Service}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a fixed dollar amount and does not grow as the account value grows. It stays steady until one of the following occurs: 1) another nondeductible contribution is added (the basis increases), 2) a rollover of an after-tax 401k contribution is made to a traditional or rollover IRA (the basis increases), 3) a Roth conversion or withdrawal from the account removes some/all of it (the basis decreases).
: The basis also is not associated with any particular account. Rather, it is an accounting device that you would need to report to the IRS each year it changes. You report the increase or decrease in basis using [https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-8606 IRS Form 8606].
: [https://www.irs.gov/publications/p590a#en_US_2020_publink1000230521 IRS Pub. 590-A] refers to this as "cost basis". This is the same word, but has a slightly differently meaning than the [[Cost basis methods |&lt;i&gt;cost basis&lt;/i&gt;]] used when calculating capital gains.
:For more, see: [[Non-deductible traditional IRA#Cost basis|Non-deductible traditional IRA § Cost basis]]

==Overview== 
When you do a backdoor Roth, you first make a nondeductible contribution (that is, already taxed) to a traditional IRA. After that transaction completes (usually in one business day), you do a Roth conversion. 

However, your pre-existing traditional IRAs will likely be entirely deductible contributions and their pre-tax earnings. When you do a Roth conversion, you cannot limit your conversion to just your nondeductible contribution. When filing your income taxes, Form 8606 considers all your traditional IRAs as if the accounts were merged in one traditional IRA, regardless of which account the Roth conversion money came from.

For example: If your nondeductible contribution is only 25% of all the money in your traditional IRAs, then only 25% of your Roth conversion amount will be tax-free. The remaining 75% of your Roth conversion amount will represent the deductible (pre-tax) money across all of your traditional IRAs. Consequently, you will owe tax (at your current income tax rate) on 75% of your Roth conversion amount (see Example 3a below). If you can transfer your pre-tax IRA funds to a solo [[401(k)]], employer-sponsored 401k, or [[403(b)]], then they will no longer be subject to taxation during the Roth conversion process.

However, in the cases where part of the conversion amount was taxed, some of your basis is considered to have been converted tax-free while some still remains for use with the rest of your traditional IRAs. Some of this basis will hang around until all of your traditional IRAs (as defined here) are empty and you will have to file [https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-8606 Form 8606] each year until then.

==Details==
===Contribute===
To do a backdoor Roth, first make a regular contribution to a traditional IRA with your IRA custodian. You do not need to tell the custodian whether the contribution is deductible or not; it is just treated as an IRA contribution. The custodian does not know (or care) if any contribution is deductible or not. That is known only to you, the IRS (and your state, if you file state income taxes), and your tax preparer. In fact, you can change your mind as to any contribution being deductible or not, up until the time you file your tax return.

"Nondeductible" simply means that you do not deduct the IRA contribution on your 1040 tax form. The transaction is recorded on Form 8606 instead and submitted with your tax return. This nondeductible contribution becomes your "basis" if you do not yet have any or is added to your existing "basis" when you prepare your taxes. One important thing to know about your basis, is that it does not grow, except by making additional nondeductible contributions. All the growth for the traditional IRA will instead be pre-tax.

The amount of the nondeductible contribution is limited to the maximum you are eligible to contribute each year, after taking other IRA contributions for the year into account. For example, the maximum IRA contribution in 2024/2025 is $7,000 per person (or $8,000 if over age 50). If you are eligible for, and make, a $4,000 traditional contribution (deductible or nondeductible), you can only make a $3,000  contribution to a Roth IRA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=l|first=Cornell Legal Information Institute|title=26 U.S. Code § 408A - Roth IRAs|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/408A|website=Cornell Law School}}&lt;/ref&gt; You cannot contribute more than your taxable compensation for the year. Non-working married spouses can also contribute to their own IRAs, even if they did not earn any income. The total contribution for both spouses cannot be greater than the total joint taxable compensation.

You can make the contribution up until the April filing deadline of the following year. The conversion can be done any time after that. In this case, you report the nondeductible contribution on Form 8606 for the tax year it applied to, but will not impact your taxes for that tax year. You will report the conversion for the year in which it happened (along with the carried-forward basis). Converting in a later year than the year of contribution would be useful for someone rolling over their traditional or rollover IRA to a 401k at year end where it is not completed by December 31. However, they would then need to file Form 8606 for both years.

===Convert===
After the contribution transaction is complete, convert it to a Roth IRA. (You can also convert more or less than that amount, as will be shown in the examples below.) The Roth account may be an existing or new account. Accomplish this transaction by "moving" or "exchanging" the cash or shares in your traditional IRA and use this to buy cash or shares in a Roth IRA. As an example, at Vanguard this is a fund exchange. Go to the traditional IRA and select "Exch" which is listed next to "Buy" and "Sell." Identify the cash/shares to be moved. Then select the Roth account on the right hand side, and select the destination fund.

Another way to convert is to call the custodian and ask them to do it by giving the originating and destination account numbers and the amount (or fund) to convert.

If you did not have any pre-existing traditional IRAs and your contribution was nondeductible you would normally convert the &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;entire&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; balance, even if the balance is higher or lower than the amount that you contributed. You pay tax only on the growth, if any, above the amount contributed. If you held the nondeductible contributions in the traditional IRA for only a few days, the tax should be minimal.

If you had pre-existing traditional IRAs, and your contribution was nondeductible, the contribution amount is considered your basis and your tax will be [[Traditional_IRA#The_.22pro-rata.22_rule|pro-rated]] over all conversions and withdrawals, until the traditional IRAs are empty.

==Cautions==
If you have pre-tax money in ''any'' traditional IRA, the taxable portion of any conversion you make is prorated over all your traditional IRAs; you cannot convert just the nondeductible amount.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/rollovers-of-after-tax-contributions-in-retirement-plans| title=Rollovers of After-Tax Contributions in Retirement Plans| publisher=IRS| accessdate=August 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are three options for how to deal with an existing traditional IRA getting in the way of a backdoor Roth IRA:

* Convert the entire traditional IRA to Roth, and pay tax on the pre-tax amount of the conversion. For a small traditional IRA this may be the easiest and best option, but if the traditional IRA is large, this will result in a large tax bill. If you are making backdoor Roth IRA contributions, you are in a middle or high tax bracket, so this might be undesirable.
* Roll the pre-tax portion of the traditional IRA into your [[401(k)]] or [[403(b)]] or [[457(b)]] at work, assuming it accepts rollovers. If the employer plan has poor investment options or high fees (or both), this may be undesirable. However, if the employer plan is large and well-managed, it may have access to institutional share classes with even lower expenses than are available in the IRA. 
* Start a business, open an Individual [[401(k)]] that accepts rollovers, and roll over the traditional IRA into the Individual 401(k). The amount of the rollover is not limited by the amount earned by the business. For example, a $10&amp;nbsp;million traditional IRA can be rolled into an Individual 401(k) opened on $10 of legitimately-earned self employment income.

In any case, you have until December 31st of the tax year in which you make the backdoor Roth IRA conversion to empty the traditional IRA. If you still have a traditional IRA balance on December 31st, then the [[Traditional_IRA#The_.22pro-rata.22_rule|pro-rata rule]] will apply to the conversion. For example, if you attempt to make a backdoor Roth IRA contribution of $6,000 while having a traditional IRA with a pre-tax balance of $50,000, then only '''10.7%''' ($6,000 / ($50,000 + $6,000)) of the conversion step will apply to the non-deductible amount, and the remainder will be converted from the pre-tax amount. This will result in '''$5,357''' ($6,000 * (1 - 10.7%)) of taxable income.

Because IRAs are ''individual'' accounts, the IRAs of one spouse do not affect the proration of the other spouse's conversion, even when filing tax Married Filing Jointly. Similarly, if someone has an inherited IRA with some basis in it as well as their own traditional IRAs (with or without basis), the tax calculations for the inherited IRA are done separately from the other traditional IRAs the beneficiary may have. In these cases, spouses need to file Form 8606 individually as well as for each inherited IRA having a basis.

When you leave an employer and you want to roll the employer's retirement plan to an IRA, request a single distribution but direct the after-tax distributions to a Roth IRA and the pre-tax distributions to a rollover IRA (which is one of the forms of a traditional IRA). While money is in the rollover IRA, DO NOT make any other contributions directly to that account. This will help make it possible for a future employer plan to accept the rollover IRA, because some employer plans do not accept money from contributory traditional IRAs (IRAs to which you contributed directly, instead of withheld from your paycheck). In other words, keep your rollover IRAs separated from your other IRAs. If you have already co-mingled employer plan rollovers with IRAs you have contributed to, the plan documents from a future employer plan will tell if the rollover back to a 401k or 403b is allowed.

Before you start the backdoor Roth, you should also understand IRS Form 8606 (examples below), as you will file it with your income taxes for the year. Fill out a rough draft of the form to understand the tax implications and see if the contribution or conversion impacts anything else in your tax situation. The front of the form deals with your basis from the previous and the current year, while part of the back of the form deals with the Roth conversion. Understanding this formula will help you see what part of your Roth conversion or traditional IRA withdrawal will be tax-free and how much will be taxed:

==Examples with Form 8606==

The [https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-8606 Form 8606] examples below use the following simple formula:
:'''ND''' = Amount of basis remaining from the previous year '''plus''' nondeductible contributions made for this year&lt;br&gt;
:'''SB''' = Sum of the balances of all your traditional IRAs at year-end '''plus''' the amount withdrawn from traditional IRAs (but not converted) '''plus''' the amount converted&lt;br&gt;
:'''TF''' = The percentage of the amount you convert (or withdraw without converting) that is tax-free for the year
::TF = 100 * ( ND / SB )

The examples use graphics to illustrate the pro rata rule. This color key shows the tax status of the various portions of the money.

Note that the (yellow) basis is not part of any particular physical account. It is just an accounting device to help you see how and why it needs to be reported to the IRS for any year where it increases or decreases.

A chart showing the data to be entered on Form 8606 for each example follows at the end.

===Example 1===
Ann has no traditional IRAs. She knows she will pay the same amount of tax on $6,000 of her high income (for 2019) whether she deposits it into her taxable account or puts it in a Roth. She is ineligible to contribute to the Roth directly due to her high income. So it is obvious for her to put it in a Roth where it can grow tax-free. She opens up a new traditional IRA and deposits $6,000 in it and will declare it as a nondeductible contribution when she files her taxes. A few days later, she converts all of it to her Roth. The tax-free amount of the conversion is:

::TF = 100 * [ 6,000 / 6,000 ] which is 100%.

Ann made the contribution right before a holiday and forgot to convert the following business day. When she remembered it, the traditional IRA balance had &lt;i&gt;grown $60&lt;/i&gt;. So now she has a basis of $6,000 and the account value is $6,060. The tax-free amount of the conversion is:

::TF = 100 * [ 6,000 / 6,060 ] which is 99%.

If she converts it all, she will pay taxes on 1% of the conversion amount ($60). Although there is rounding in the percentage, she will be able to subtract her basis ($6,000) from the converted amount. There will be no basis left.

If she only converts the $6,000, 99% of the $6,000 basis ($5,940) will go with the converted amount and 1% of the basis ($60) will remain behind. So she would still need to pay taxes on the $60 that was converted but was not tax-free. Next year, she can convert the remaining $60 tax-free since it has a $60 basis, assuming there is no growth meanwhile. To keep things simple, she decides to convert all of it now.

===Example 1b===
Ann made the contribution right before a holiday and forgot to convert the following business day. When she remembered it, the traditional IRA balance had &lt;i&gt;fallen $60&lt;/i&gt;. So now she has a basis of $6,000 and the account value is $5,940. The tax-free amount of the conversion is:

::TF = 100 * [ 6,000 / 5,940 ] which is 101%.

Because the tax-free percentage cannot be more than 100%, it resets to 100%. If she converts it all, she will pay no taxes on the conversion. What happens with the remaining basis ($60) is unclear. Leaving a dollar in the account and converting $5,939 ''might'' make it more likely she will retain $61 basis instead of losing $60 basis. This will be useful if she has future growth (or a deductible contribution of at least $61) in her traditional IRA because she will be able to convert $61 of it tax-free.

===Example 2===
Ben has $50,000 of deductible contributions and its growth in his traditional IRA, and has some taxable money he can use to pay most (but not all) of the conversion taxes. He also has a rollover IRA with $350,000 that contains only a 401k rolled over from a former employer and growth since the rollover. He is not eligible to contribute to a Roth directly but wants to do a backdoor Roth. It will be his first time for a backdoor Roth and he thinks he would also like to do one in the following year as he will convert half of the traditional IRA each year.

===Example 2a===
This year, before Ben starts the backdoor Roth, he rolls over the rollover IRA into a new 401k he has with a new employer.

Then he makes a nondeductible contribution of $6,000 to his traditional IRA, which brings the account value up to $56,000. Then he converts half of the IRA ($28,000), saving the other half for a Roth conversion in the following year. But by the end of the year, the $28,000 remaining in the traditional IRA grows another $4,000 giving the IRA a year-end value of $32,000. (Note that the Roth may have also grown the same amount.) The tax-free amount of the conversion is:

::TF = 100 * [ 6,000 / (32,000 + 0 + 28,000) ] = 100 * [ 6,000 / 60,000 ] which is 10%.

This makes 10% of his $28,000 conversion ($2,800) be tax free and $25,200 ($28,000 - $2,800) will be taxed. It also leaves $3,200 of his basis unused ($6,000 - $2,800).

{| style="border: 1px solid darkgray;"
|+ '''Example 2a'''
|-
||[[File:Backdoorroth5.jpg]]
|}

===Example 2b===
In the following year, if he converts before the account changes value again, Ben will withdraw the amount of $32,000, but this time he messes up and withholds 15% ($4,800) for federal taxes. This is a withdrawal amount that is NOT converted and there will be a 10% penalty on the pre-tax portion of the withheld amount, in additional to income tax, for early withdrawal if he is not yet 59.5. (Penalties are calculated on Form 5329.) He converts the remaining $27,200. A while later in the year, he makes a nondeductible contribution of $6,000 and converts it the following day. At the end of the year, his traditional IRAs are all empty. For this following year, there will be a tax-free amount of:

::TF = 100 * [(3,200 + 6,000) / (0 + 4,800 + 27,200 + 6,000)] = 100 * [ 9,200 / 38,000 ] which is 24.21%

This makes 24.21% of his $4,800 withdrawal ($1,162) and 24.21% of his $27,200 + $6,000 conversions ($8,038) be tax free. That leaves $3,638 of the withdrawal for tax withholding ($4,800 - 1,162) and $25,162 of the two conversions ($33,200 - 8,038) to be taxed. It also leaves no basis (or any other money) in his traditional IRA.

Note that the IRS is still holding the entire $4,800 to apply to his tax liability although part of that withholding is not taxed (that is, $1,162). That is just like the Roth holding the entire $33,200 ($27,200 + 6,000) even though some of it is not taxed (that is, $8,038).

===Example 3===
Chris is nearing retirement and wants to be ready to do some large Roth conversions on her 401k before starting Social Security. She plans to roll some of it into a traditional IRA right after she retires, but will leave it alone for this year and next. But to clean things up before then, she wants to 1) finish converting her small SEP-IRA from a former employer, 2) do a backdoor Roth each year while working, and 3) draw down an inherited traditional IRA from her mother. Her mother had been doing backdoor Roths but died before she had converted everything in her traditional IRA. 

Inherited traditional IRAs and inherited Roth IRAs can not receive new contributions nor be converted. They can only have withdrawals taken out. Although Chris had inherited half of her mother's traditional IRA and Roth IRA, the inherited &lt;i&gt;Roth&lt;/i&gt; IRA is irrelevant to this example. But the remaining basis in the inherited &lt;i&gt;traditional&lt;/i&gt; IRA still needs to be addressed (and is useful for account owners to know if they will be leaving basis in their traditional IRAs for their heirs).

===Example 3a===
Chris needs to process her own accounts separate from the inherited IRA. Her SEP-IRA only contains $15,000 and she wants to do a $5,000 backdoor Roth. She opens up a new traditional IRA account and makes the $5,000 nondeductible contribution to it. Between the two accounts, they total $20,000 and $5,000 is the basis. She converts the entire traditional IRA and $5,000 of the SEP-IRA, leaving only $10,000 in the SEP-IRA at the end of the year. To calculate the tax-free part of the $10,000 in Roth conversions:

::TF = 100 * [ 5,000 / (10,000 + 0 + 10,000) ] = 100 * [ 5,000 / 20,000 ] = which is 25%.

This makes 25% of her $10,000 conversion ($2,500) be tax-free and $7,500 ($10,000 - $2,500) will be taxed. It also leaves $2,500 of her basis ($5,000 - $2,500) left for a future year.

{| style="border: 1px solid darkgray;"
|+ '''Example 3a'''
|-
||[[File:Backdoorroth7.jpg]]
|}

===Example 3b===
The remaining account value of the inherited (traditional) IRA is $60,000 of which $20,000 is the remaining basis from the previous year. (When receiving the inherited IRA, if the deceased had high compensation, the executor or trustee of the estate should look at the deceased's past tax returns to see if there was remaining basis reported on Form 8606.) Withdrawals from an inherited IRA cannot be converted. In the current year, Chris withdraws $40,000 (more than her Required Minimum Distribution) and the tax-free percentage of the inherited IRA withdrawal is:

::TF = 100 * [ 20,000 / (20,000 + 40,000 + 0) ] = 100 * [ 20,000 / 60,000 ] = which is 33.33%.

This makes 33.33% of her $40,000 withdrawal ($13,333) be tax-free and $26,667 ($40,000 - $13,333) will be taxed. It also leaves $6,667 of her basis ($20,000 - $13,333) left for a future year.

{| style="border: 1px solid darkgray;"
|+ '''Example 3b'''
|-
||[[File:Backdoorroth8.jpg]]
|}

Chris will need to file two copies of Form 8606 for the year, one for her own accounts and one for the inherited IRA. They will maintain separate carry-over bases. If she is married, her spouse will also have to file a separate Form 8606 with a separate pro rata calculation, if needed.

===Using tax software===
To report a full backdoor Roth procedure in Turbo Tax (at least, and possibly in other software), it is often helpful to skip the tax software's default order of data entry, which asks you about income first, and IRA contributions later.&lt;ref name="crit"&gt;{{Forum post| p=4291809|title=Re: Wiki page UPGRADE: Backdoor Roth|date=31 December 2018|author=crit}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Enter your other income and wages as usual, but do NOT enter the 1099-R from your IRA distribution on your first pass. Instead, after entering other income, navigate manually to the IRA contribution section. You can do this by clicking on the tabs for 'Federal Taxes', then scroll down under 'Deductions and Credits' to the 'Retirement and Investments' section, and click on the 'Start' button for contributions. As noted above, in the backdoor process, you made a contribution to a traditional IRA, so that is what you report -- not a Roth contribution.&lt;ref name="crit" /&gt;

Once you have completed the contributions section, use the manual navigation again to go back to the income section, and now enter the information from the 1099R that reports the distribution from that traditional IRA. This step reports the conversion of the traditional IRA to Roth IRA. Be careful to enter exactly which boxes were checked for the distribution.&lt;ref name="crit" /&gt;

Once you have completed both the contribution and the 1099-R steps, use the 'Forms' view to check that your Form 8606 has been created correctly.&lt;ref name="crit" /&gt;

For examples of screen shots while doing data entry in popular tax software programs, you can also look at [[The Finance Buff|The Finance Buff's]] blog pages for 
TaxAct,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thefinancebuff.com/how-to-backdoor-roth-taxact.html|title=How to Report Backdoor Roth in TaxAct|accessdate=January 1, 2019|publisher=The Finance Buff}}&lt;/ref&gt; TurboTax,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thefinancebuff.com/how-to-report-backdoor-roth-in-turbotax.html|title=How to Report Backdoor Roth in TurboTax|accessdate=January 1, 2019|publisher=The Finance Buff}}&lt;/ref&gt; H&amp;R Block software,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thefinancebuff.com/how-to-backdoor-roth-hr-block-software.html|title=How to Report Backdoor Roth in H&amp;R Block Software|accessdate=January 1, 2019|publisher=The Finance Buff}}&lt;/ref&gt; or FreeTaxUSA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thefinancebuff.com/how-to-backdoor-roth-freetaxusa.html|title=How to Report Backdoor Roth in FreeTaxUSA|accessdate=January 1, 2019|publisher=The Finance Buff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To see how multiple years of Form 8606 should look (for example, if you neglected to file several years and now want to rectify things), or to see the interaction between Form 8606 and Worksheet 1-1 in Publication 590-B, the 'Form8606' tab of the [[Tools_and_calculators#Personal_finance_toolbox|Personal finance toolbox]]&lt;ref name ="MrMoney"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://forum.mrmoneymustache.com/forum-information-faqs/case-study-spreadsheet-updates/| title=The MMM Case Study Spreadsheet| publisher=The Mr. Money Mustache Community| accessdate=January 23, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; is useful.

{{for|additional information|wikipedia:401(k)}}

A '''401(k)''' plan is a type of employer-sponsored defined-contribution retirement plan. Its name comes from section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/401| title=26 U.S. Code § 401 - Qualified pension, profit-sharing, and stock bonus plans| publisher=Legal Information Institute| accessdate=February 9, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also generally governed by Title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). 

A 401(k) allows eligible employees to elect to contribute some of their pay into the plan through [[payroll deductions]]. Contributions are pre-tax, meaning they are not included in the employee's taxable income, and some plans also have a [[#Roth 401(k)|Roth]] contribution option. Sometimes, employers will make [[employer matching contributions]] or other types of contributions into employees' accounts. Employees can invest their money in the investment choices offered by the plan, typically a selection of stock and bond-based mutual funds, and sometimes other less common investments too. 

Pre-tax money in the plan grows [[Tax_basics#Tax_deferral|tax-deferred]] and is taxable income when later withdrawn, and Roth growth and withdrawals are tax-free subject to some basic [[#Distributions|distribution]] requirements. There is a 10% penalty for taking withdrawals before age 59½, although there are many [[Early_withdrawal|exceptions]]. Pre-tax money is subject to [[Required Minimum Distribution|Required Minimum Distributions]] (RMDs) starting at age 73 or 75, unless you are still working for the employer. Money in a 401(k) can be left to heirs, and most non-spouse heirs will have to empty the account by the end of the 10th year after your death.

==Advantages==
* You get an immediate tax break, because contributions come out of your paycheck before taxes are withheld. Although you will later pay taxes on withdrawals, most people most of the time have a lower tax rate when retired than while working.
** If you think your future tax rate will be similar to or higher than your current tax rate, many plans offer a [[#Roth_401(k)|designated Roth account]], where contributions are taxable, but future growth and withdrawals are tax-free. The choice of pre-tax/traditional or Roth contributors can be a complex [[Traditional versus Roth|tax-planning decision]]. 
* Many employers will [[Employer matching contributions|match your contributions]] at least partially, for example 50 cents on the dollar for the first 6 percent of your salary you save. If an employer has "frozen" the company's defined benefit plan, the company may increase the company match in the 401(k) plan to compensate for the reduced defined plan benefit.
* Tax-deferred growth - meaning you do not pay taxes each year on capital gains, dividends, and other distributions. This feature makes your money grow [[Tax basics|faster]], gives you valuable space to hold [[Tax-efficient fund placement|tax-inefficient investments]], and lets you buy and sell investments for [[rebalancing]] or changing your portfolio without incurring capital gains tax.
* Contributions are deducted from your paycheck before you get access to the money. From a behavioral finance perspective, this reduces the risk you will spend money needed for retirement, and helps you build and maintain the habit of saving. 
* Historically, many 401(k) plans had high fees which made them inferior to [[IRA|IRAs]]. However, 401(k) fees have come down in recent decades, and many plans are competitive with IRAs. Some plans even offer funds with lower fees than IRAs (for example, "Institutional-class" funds) and/or unique investments (for example, a [[stable value fund]] or real estate fund) that may be valuable to certain investors. 
* When eligible to participate, you can normally contribute more to the 401(k) than to your IRA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/plan-participant-employee/retirement-topics-401k-and-profit-sharing-plan-contribution-limits| title=Retirement topics: 401(k) and profit-sharing plan contribution limits| publisher=IRS| accessdate=January 9, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Contributions made to a 401(k) qualify for the Retirement Savings Contributions Credit ([[Saver's credit|Saver's Credit]]) if you meet the filing and income requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/publications/p571| title=Publication 571, Tax-Sheltered Annuity Plans (403(b) Plans)| publisher=IRS| accessdate=January 9, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Especially if the plan is governed by [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employee_Retirement_Income_Security_Act_of_1974 ERISA], money gets a high degree of [[asset protection]] at the federal level. Money in ERISA plans cannot taken by a creditor, even if they successfully sue you and get a judgment, and if you declare bankruptcy you get to keep money in the plan.
* [[Estate planning]] benefits - money can be left to heirs easily via designated beneficiaries (avoiding probate), and non-spouse heirs generally get an additional [[Stretch IRA|10 years]] of tax-deferred or tax-free growth before they have to empty the account.

==Disadvantages==
* Plans are generally not designed to allow access to funds before age 59½ without paying taxes and a 10% penalty.
* The employer chooses the available funds. They may be better (institutional shares) than funds available in personal accounts, or worse (high-cost funds), and they may or may not fit well within your investing plan. (You may have greater fund selection if the plan has a [[Self directed brokerage account]].)
* The plan may only offer funds with embedded fees, and/or charge fees on top of what is charged by the funds. Even seemingly small fees significantly erode long-term performance.
* The employer may change the fund selection, fees, or plan rules at any time.
* Employer contributions may not become ''vested'' (that is, become the property of the employee) until a certain number of years have passed.
* The plans are not insured by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC).

==Contributions==

A 401(k) plan is only required to offer a pre-tax (also known as a "traditional") account, but many plans also offer [[#Roth_401(k)|Roth 401(k)]] and/or [[#After-tax_401(k)|After-tax 401(k)]] accounts. You can only make these three types of regular contributions through direct payroll deductions. 

Pre-tax and Roth sub-accounts share an annual contribution limit, known as the ''elective deferral limit.'' If you are age 50 or older, you get an additional ''catch-up contribution'' limit, which now depends on your age.  Catch-up contributions for 2026 must be made to a Roth 401(k) if the employee's 2025 wages exceeded $150,000. These limits are shown in the following table:

{{Retirement Plan Contribution Limits}}
Employees can generally contribute up to 100% of their wages as elective deferrals. Contributions are included as wages subject to withholding for Social Security and Medicare taxes. In addition, your employer must report the elective contributions as wages subject to federal unemployment taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc424| title=Topic no. 424, 401(k) plans| publisher=IRS| accessdate=January 9, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, there is an overall plan contribution limit, sometimes called the ''Section 415(c) limit'', which as of 2026 is '''$72,000''', not including catch-up contributions. This limit applies to all contributions into the plan, including:

*employee elective deferrals
*employer contributions (matching, profit-sharing, etc.)
*employee after-tax contributions
*[[#Nonelective_contributions|nonelective contributions]]

===Automatic enrollment and contributions===

Employers may configure their plans to automatically enroll eligible employees, unless that employee opts out. You can normally withdraw automatic enrollment contributions penalty free, if you request the withdrawal within 90 days of the first deferral and completed within 6 months of the plan year in which they began. A safe harbor for nondiscrimination testing is available if plans have:
# Initial deferrals of at least 3% of pay, increasing annually by 1% to a number between 6% and 10% of pay,
# Either
## An employer match of 100% on the first 1% and 50% on the next 5% of pay, or
## A 3% nonelective contribution,
# 100% vesting after two years, 
# Default investment selections satisfying Department of Labor regulations, and
# Annual notice to all employees regarding their right to opt out or change the automatic provisions.
Provided the notice requirement is met, and the default investments satisfy Department of Labor regulations, automatic enrollment will be governed by ERISA and preempt any contradictory state laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://institutional.vanguard.com/insights-and-research/perspective/the-power-of-autoenrollment.html| title=The power of autoenrollment| publisher=Vanguard| accessdate=January 9, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Employer match===
{{Main|Employer matching contributions}}

Employers sometimes offer matching contributions when you contribute to pre-tax or Roth accounts. The matching calculation is typically a percentage of employee contributions up to a certain percentage of your salary (for example, 50% of contributions up to 6% of your salary). Until recently, all employer matching contributions went into the pre-tax account regardless of whether the employee's contributions are pre-tax or Roth. However, as of 2022 the SECURE Act 2.0 now allows employers to offer Roth matches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.kitces.com/blog/secure-act-2-omnibus-2022-hr-2954-rmd-75-529-roth-rollover-increase-qcd-student-loan-match/| title=SECURE Act 2.0: Later RMDs, 529-To-Roth Rollovers, And Other Tax Planning Opportunities| publisher=Kitces Nerd's Eye View| author=Jeffrey Levine|date=December 28, 2022|accessdate=January 9, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any Roth matches are taxable income to the employee and must be immediately vested. Employers do not generally match contributions to an after-tax account, but read your plan rules for details.

Getting an employer match should be a top [[Prioritizing investments|financial priority]], as it is like free money, not to mention  money that automatically gets tax-advantaged growth, and asset protection and estate planning benefits.

===Nonelective contributions===

Employers can make certain other contributions not elected by the employees, such as profit sharing contributions. Before 2007, these contributions had to become vested on or faster than either (a) 20% each year from years 3-7 of service or (b) 100% after 5 years of service. Contributions made in and since 2007 must become vested on or faster than either (a) 20% each year from years 2-6 of service or (b) 100% after 3 years of service (with an delayed effective date for collectively bargained plans). 

===Multiple plans===

If you have more than one job, the Section 415(c) plan applies to each plan you have access to as long as the employers are ''unrelated'', meaning that the large-share owners are not the same person or close family members. If a set of businesses are owned by closely related people, the IRS considers them part of a ''controlled group'', and the Section 415(c) limit applies to all plans within this group. Controlled group rules can be very complex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.employeefiduciary.com/blog/is-your-company-part-of-a-controlled-group-you-need-to-know-or-risk-401k-plan-disqualification| title=Is Your Company Part of a Controlled Group?  You Need to Know or Risk 401(k) Plan Disqualification| publisher=Employee Fiduciary| author=Eric Droblyen|date=July 30, 2025|accessdate=September 25, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

You get only one elective deferral limit per year, regardless of how many plans you may have access to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.whitecoatinvestor.com/multiple-401k|title=Multiple 401(k) Rules – What to Do with Multiple 401(k) Accounts|author=Dr. Jim Dahle|date=July 21, 2020|accessdate=September 25, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investments==

401(k) plans only offer a set of investments selected by the plan provider, usually in the range of one to several dozen options. Choices typically including a selection of stock and bond [[mutual fund|mutual funds]] and maybe other investments. Historically, employer plans have commonly had high fees, both inside the funds and sometimes added on top of the fund expenses. However, 401(k) plans have come down in recent decades, especially at larger employers. Some plans may even offer better investments than can be purchased inside an [[IRA]] or [[Taxable account|brokerage]] account, such as "institutional-class" funds, a [[stable value fund]], private investments, and others. 

When choosing funds in a 401(k), pay close attention to each investment's [[Expense ratios|expense ratio]]. The data are overwhelming that low-fee [[Index fund|index funds]] and other passive investments statistically outperform high-fee actively-managed funds in the long run.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.whitecoatinvestor.com/managers-dont-beat-markets/|title=Managers Don’t Beat Markets (Why Index Funds Are the Best Way to Invest in the Stock Market)|author=Dr. Jim Dahle|date=March 18, 2025|accessdate=September 25, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt; Look for funds with expense ratios in the range of 0.10% or less. 

Many funds are not necessary to build a good portfolio; in fact, simpler portfolios tend to be better. A great portfolio can be built with just [[Three-fund portfolio|three funds]]. If you have retirement money saved in other places besides the 401(k) ([[IRA|IRAs]], a spouse's [[Employer retirement plans overview|employer plan]], taxable brokerage account, etc.) then you can build a portfolio around a 401(k) with just one good fund. If your plan has no good fund options, see: [[#Expensive_or_mediocre_choices|Expensive or mediocre choices]] below.

Some plans offer a [[Self directed brokerage account|Self-Directed Brokerage Account]] (SDBA) which lets you invest in a wider range of investments. If your plan does not offer any good mutual funds, a SDBA can be used to purchase low-cost [[Exchange-traded fund|exchange-traded funds]] (ETFs). The fee savings of the investments should be weighed against the costs associated with the SDBA. 

===Target retirement funds===
{{See also|Approximating Vanguard target date funds}}

The default option for employer provider plans is to place your contributions and employer matches into a [[Target date retirement funds|target date retirement fund]].

Investors have increased their allocation to target retirement funds over time. Vanguard reports data for the employer provided funds it manages in annual ''"How America Saves"'' studies. Among the findings:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://institutional.vanguard.com/VGApp/iip/site/institutional/clientsolutions/dc/howamericasaves| title=How America Saves 2013| publisher=Vanguard Institutional}}{{dead link}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=June 2025|title=How America Saves 2025|url=https://institutional.vanguard.com/content/dam/inst/iig-transformation/insights/pdf/2025/has/2025_How_America_Saves.pdf|website=Vanguard Institutional}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Employee account balance holdings of target retirement funds increased from a 3% allocation in 2006 to a 63% allocation in 2024.
* Employee contributions to target retirement funds increased from 4% in 2006 to 85% allocation in 2024.
* In 2012, employees 25 years old and younger held 68% of their account balances in target retirement funds.
* In 2012, employees with less than 10,000 dollars in their plans held 56% of their account balances in target retirement funds.
* Employees using target date target-date funds increased from 69% in 2015 to 84% in 2024.

===Employer stock===

Some plans offer employer stock as an investment option, or contribute the employer match in the form of employer stock. Plans offering employer stock must offer at least three diversified investment options with materially different risk and return characteristics. They must allow you to diversify elective deferral contributions immediately (at least quarterly), and also allow you to diversify employer contributions after three years of service.

Because you already have plenty of risk tied with the performance of your employer, keeping your 401(k) contributions in employer stock is not recommended; in contrast, diversifying out of or even complete avoiding employer stock in your 401(k) is strongly recommended. However, if you hold employer stock with a low basis and you are considering a lump sum distribution rollover of plan assets, see [[Net unrealized appreciation]].

==Nondiscrimination==

Under ERISA, retirement plans including 401(k) plans are not allowed to discriminate in favor of [[Highly compensated employee |highly compensated employees]]. They can make corrections by returning the excess contributions to those highly compensated employees within a specified period of time after the plan year ends. The returned funds are taxable income when received. The time period varies based on other features of the plan, generally from 2.5 to 6 months. If not returned timely by the employer, the employee will also be subject to an additional 10% excise tax.

This rule is waived for plans which meet certain safe harbors. Among other attributes, these safe harbor plans are characterized by certain minimum employer contribution rates as well as more favorable vesting provisions for employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Safe Harbor 401k|url= https://www.investopedia.com/safe-harbor-401k-plan-8620915|publisher=Investopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roth 401(k)==
{{See also|Traditional versus Roth}}

An employer may also elect to make Roth 401(k) contributions available; such an account is known as a '''designated Roth account'''. They are the 401(k) equivalent of [[Roth IRA]] contributions, and if the 401(k) is rolled over they can be rolled directly to a Roth IRA or another Roth 401(k). These are normally administered as a sub-account of the employee's 401(k) account. Both Roth and regular contributions are subject to the same contribution limit. Starting in 2024 and later years, RMDs are no longer required from designated Roth 401(k) and 403(b) accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/retirement-plan-and-ira-required-minimum-distributions-faqs#:~:text=Designated%20Roth%20accounts%20in%20a,required%20from%20designated%20Roth%20accounts | title= Retirement plan and IRA Required Minimum Distributions FAQs | publisher=Internal Revenue Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Distributions===

When taking a distribution directly from a designated Roth account (that is, not rolling it over into another account), special rules apply. The account becomes fully qualified when you have met the five-year holding period for the account,&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The five-year holding period for a designated Roth account begins on the first day of the taxable year you make your first contribution to that specific account. It does not matter how long you have had a Roth IRA or any other designated Roth account. This is one of several "five-year rules" that apply to Roth accounts.&lt;/ref&gt; and are either age 59½ or disabled. If the account is not fully qualified, any distributions are ''pro-rata'' - that is, in equal proportions from the basis (contributions) and earnings within the account. The following table summarizes the distribution rules for the simpler case when the account does not contain any In-Plan Roth Rollovers (IRRs):

{| class="wikitable collapsible" width=800px
|-
!  width=500px | 
!  width=500px | Under age 59½, no [[Early withdrawal|exception]]
!  width=500px | Under age 59½, [[Early withdrawal|exception]] other than disability
!  width=500px | Over age 59½ ''or'' disabled
|-
| colspan="4" |
|-
! Five year holding period ''met''
| rowspan="2" style="background:#F99;vertical-align:middle;text-align:center;" | Pro-rata: tax and penalty on earnings, basis tax- and penalty-free
| rowspan="2" style="background:#FFFF90;vertical-align:middle;text-align:center;" | Pro-rata: only tax on earnings
| style="background:#9F9;vertical-align:middle;text-align:center;" | Fully qualified
|-
! Five year holding period ''not met''
| style="background:#FFFF90;vertical-align:middle;text-align:center;" | Pro-rata: only tax on earnings
|-
|}

When the account contains IRRs, the rules are very complex,&lt;ref&gt;{{forum link| t=460229| title=&lt;nowiki&gt;[Wiki] Proposed new pages - Rule of 55, Early Withdrawal [and now "Retirement account at a former employer"]&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; and legal ambiguity exists. IRRs generally belong in the "basis" category with respect to the above pro-rata calculation, but the exact ordering between direct contributions and IRRs is determined by the plan rules. To make matters worse, plans are generally not required to populate Box 10 of [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1099r.pdf Form 1099-R] unless the distribution is taken under a [[Substantially equal periodic payments|SEPP]]. 

In either case, if the designed Roth account is not qualified, you are generally better off to first roll the money out into a Roth IRA and then take withdrawals from the Roth IRA, because Roth IRA distributions always order contributions and conversions/rollovers before earnings. This strategy also avoids the complex and error-prone calculations for distributions from the designated Roth account.

==After-tax 401(k)==
{{main|After-tax 401(k)}}

An employer may also allow you to make After-tax 401(k) contributions. These are the 401(k) equivalent of [[Non-deductible traditional IRA |non-deductible traditional IRA]] contributions, and if the 401(k) is rolled over they can be rolled directly to a Roth IRA. These are normally administered as a sub-account of the employee's 401(k) account. IRS rules allow employees to contribute up to 100% of compensation into an after-tax 401(k), up to the overall Section 415(c) limit for the plan. Employers usually limit after-tax contributions to a certain percentage of salary, but the limit is still often much higher than for pre-tax or Roth accounts. 

IRC Section 415(c)(1)(A) sets the total contribution limit for both employee and employer contributions to a 401(k), and is summarized in [https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/plan-participant-employee/retirement-topics-403b-contribution-limits Retirement Topics 403b Contribution Limits]. Therefore, the after-tax contribution limit is the remaining amount allowed after all employee and employer contributions. And for most people that can afford to contribute, it would allow them to save nearly twice as much money in tax-advantaged space as the combination of elective deferrals and employer contributions.

Just like [[non-deductible traditional IRA]] contributions, earnings are taxed upon withdrawal or conversion at ordinary income rates. Therefore, an after-tax 401(k) account is not great on its own; it's usually better to invest after-tax money in a [[taxable account]], so future growth will be taxed at lower long-term capital gains rates. But, an after-tax 401(k) is useful as an intermediary account, because funds can be rolled over into a [[#Roth_401(k)|Roth sub-account]] or out into a [[Roth IRA]], if the plan allows in-plan Roth rollovers or [[#In-service_distribution|in-service distributions]]. During either rollover, the basis (contributions) rolls over tax-free, and only the growth is taxable. If you are able to roll after-tax 401(k) money into a Roth account quickly, the growth will be minimal, and the overall transaction has the net effect of a Roth contribution. This process is called the [[Mega-backdoor Roth]]. For 401(k) plans with the necessary features, this process allows large Roth contributions in excess of the normal 401(k) limits.

==Plan loans==

Most major companies also offer a loan provision on their 401(k) plans that let you borrow against your account and repay yourself with interest. Restrictions will vary by company but most let you withdraw no more than 50 percent of your vested account value as a loan. You then repay the loan with interest, through deductions taken directly from your paychecks. You must repay the loan within five years unless you use it to buy your main home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/plan-sponsor/401k-resource-guide-plan-sponsors-general-distribution-rules| title=401k Resource Guide Plan Sponsors General Distribution Rules| publisher=IRS| accessdate=January 9, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to tax year 2018, you had a 60-day window on employment termination, to repay a 401(k) loan balance or rollover the loan balance to an eligible retirement account, in order to avoid the loan balance from being treated as a distribution. The 2017 tax reform (Tax Cuts and Jobs Act) extended the loan repayment and rollover window to the tax filing deadline (including the tax filing extension, if applicable) for tax years 2018 and later. Effectively, this increases the time that you have, to repay or rollover the loan balance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://sponsor.fidelity.com/bin-public/06_PSW_Website/documents/taxlawchanged-table.pdf| title=Recent Changes in Tax Laws Affect Qualified Retirement Plans and Health &amp; Welfare Benefits| publisher=Fidelity}}{{dead link}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.creditkarma.com/tax/i/401k-tax-reform-loan-repay| title=401(k) Tax Reform Equals More Time to Repay 401(k) Loans| publisher=Credit Karma| accessdate=January 9, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early withdrawals==
{{Main|Early withdrawal}}

Employer plans may allow early withdrawals under some circumstances, but whether the 10% early withdrawal penalty applies is governed by IRS rules. Plans are only required to allow withdrawals when you separate from service, become disabled, die, for [[Required Minimum Distribution|RMDs]], or if/when the plan terminates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.employeefiduciary.com/blog/401k-distribution-rules-frequently-asked-questions| title=401(k) Distribution Rules: Frequently Asked Questions for Employers and Employees| publisher=Employee Fiduciary| author=Eric Droblyen| date=May 6, 2025 |accessdate=September 1, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, many plans do not allow you to withdraw after you turn 59½ if you are still working, even though such withdrawals would be penalty-free. 

Early withdrawal penalties apply to withdrawals before you are age 59½ unless one of the exceptions apply. Some common exceptions are listed below. A complete list is available on the [[Early withdrawal|main page]].

*[[Rule of 55]] - if you separate from your employer in or after the year you turn 55
*A series of payments under a [[Substantially equal periodic payments|Substantially Equal Periodic Payments]] (SEPP) plan, useful for [[early retirement]]
*Qualified reservist distributions&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Qualified reservist distributions may be made to military reservists called up for at least 180 days, with no early withdrawal penalty. Reservists may re-contribute the amount of the qualified reservist distribution to an IRA in the 2 year period beginning the day after the end of their active duty. The extension of the repayment and rollover window is applicable to [[403(b)]] and [[457(b)]] plans, in addition to 401(k) plans.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Medical expenses
*Total and permanent disability
*Terminal illness
*Death

===Hardship distributions===
 
Plans ''may'', but are not required to, allow employees to withdraw money from plans for financial hardships, defined as an immediate and heavy financial need, and you are only allowed to withdraw the amount necessary to satisfy that need.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/plan-participant-employee/retirement-topics-hardship-distributions| title=Retirement topics - Hardship distributions| publisher=IRS| accessdate=August 27, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes hardships of your beneficiary under the plan.. Such withdrawals ''may be'' subject to early withdrawal penalties if one of the exceptions does not apply. 

==In-service distribution==
An '''in-service distribution''', also known as an in-service withdrawal or in-service rollover, is when a participant takes a rollover distribution from the plan while still employed at the company that is offering the plan.

IRS rules do not permit this for employees age 59½ or younger, for their elective employee pretax or Roth contributions; for participants age 59½ or older, a plan ''may'' allow it. A plan may, however, allow for in-service distributions of the employer matching contributions and of the employee's [[401(k)#After-tax_401.28k.29|after-tax 401(k)]] contributions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://thefinancebuff.com/in-service-withdrawal-the-law-and-the-plan-rules.html| title=In-Service Withdrawal: The Law and The Plan Rules| publisher=The Finance Buff| date=February 1, 2011| accessdate=January 9, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{forum link| t=50493 |title=In-service 401(k) rollover to IRA (under 40, still employed)| date=February 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rollovers==
{{Main|Retirement account at a former employer}}
{{See also|IRA rollovers and transfers}}

When your employment ends, you have the following options with the 401(k) at your previous employer. The [[Retirement account at a former employer|main article]] has more detail and discusses some less common situations. 

===Roll the money into your new employer's plan===

Potential advantages:
*Simplicity - you have one less account to keep track of, and [[rebalancing]] is easier
*Some employer plans have better investments than you can get in an IRA, or investments that could be uniquely valuable. See: [[Retirement_account_at_a_former_employer#Investments_in_employer_plans|Investments in employer plans]]
*Easier access:
**If you retire in the year you turn 55, you can access the money penalty-free by way of the [[Rule of 55]]
**If the new employer's plan has a plan loan feature, you can use this feature with rolled in money (whereas plan loans from accounts at a former employer are not allowed)
*If you work past [[Required Minimum Distribution]] (RMD) age, money in the new employer's plan is exempt from RMDs

Potential disadvantages:
*The new employer's plan may have undesirable fees and/or investment choices that are not ideal

===Roll the money into an IRA===

Potential advantages:
*It is easy to find [[IRA|IRAs]] with great investment choices and low fees
*The account is entirely under your control, so you avoid potential complications related to your employer, such as them adding fees or changing investment options, or problems with your account such as if the employer goes out of business.
*Unlike employer plans, you can withdraw money from an IRA at any time (although whether these withdrawals are subject to penalties and additional taxes is determined by [[Early withdrawal|IRS rules]]). 
**Although not common, if you want the ability to do [[Roth conversion|Roth conversions]] and your employer's plan does not allow In-Plan Roth Rollovers (IRRs), leaving pre-tax money in an IRA will allow this.
**The [[Roth IRA]] distribution rules are generally more favorable for early distributions than for designated Roth accounts, if you want to [[Early retirement|retire early]] or need money in an emergency.

Potential disadvantages:
*Any pre-tax money in a [[traditional IRA]] interferes with the [[Backdoor Roth IRA]] process. If you are a higher earner who needs to use the Backdoor Roth IRA process to contribute to a Roth IRA, this would make those contributions impossible.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;You could still execute the Backdoor Roth IRA process, but it would act more like a taxable [[Roth conversion]], which is probably not desirable if you are adding that taxable income on top of a high earned income.&lt;/ref&gt; This is ''not'' an issue for Roth money, as [[Roth IRA]] balances are not included in the pro-rata calculation.
*Money in an IRA foregoes potential benefits from an employer plan, such as Rule of 55, plan loans (if your employer's plan has this feature), and the suspension of RMDs if you work past RMD age. Whether these features are valuable to you depends on your individual situation.
*Money in an IRA generally gets less [[asset protection]] than money in an employer plan. Money in a Rollover IRA, if not commingled with other IRA money and with no direct contributions made into it, gets unlimited protection from bankruptcy at the federal level. Protection of an IRA against general creditor claims is at the state level, with some states offering limited or no protection. Money in an [[ERISA]] employer plan gets unlimited federal protection from both bankruptcy and creditor claims.
*There are plenty of unscrupulous salespeople (many of whom call themselves "financial advisors") who would love to sell you poor-quality fee-laden and/or high-risk investments in an IRA, such as loaded mutual funds, annuities, permanent life insurance, private investments, and others. The investment choices in employer plans, while possibly not ideal, at least protect against predatory salespeople and scams.

===Leave the money in the former employer's plan===

Potential advantages:
*If the new employer's plan is not good (or doesn't accept incoming rollovers) and you don't want to roll the money out into an IRA (for example, if you want to make Backdoor Roth IRA contributions), leaving money in the former employer's plan may be the best option
*If the plan has [[Retirement_account_at_a_former_employer#Investments_in_employer_plans|desirable investments]] compared to the new employer's plan or an IRA, it could be a benefit to leave the money inside

Potential disadvantages:
*You have one more account to keep track of and potentially forget about, and rebalancing is more difficult
*The former employer can forcibly roll money out of the plan into an IRA if the balance is less than $7,000, or forcibly distribute it if less than $1,000
*The former employer's plan may have undesirable fees and/or investment choices that are not ideal
*You cannot access the money by way of the Rule of 55 or plan loans after you separate
*The account will be subject to RMDs even if you are still working for your new employer at RMD age
*Although not common, investors sometimes have issues getting access to money in a former employer's plan, for example if the employer is bought out, goes out of business, etc.

===Take a distribution as cash===

This is usually advisable only if you need the money immediately and have no other sources to draw from, including taking a loan at reasonable terms. You will pay a 10% early distribution penalty if an [[Early withdrawal|exception]] does not apply. You will also owe taxes on the distribution, and Roth money withdrawn early may generate taxes that you would not pay if you waited until age 59½. In addition to these immediate taxes and penalties, you also forego the future benefits of retirement accounts, such as tax-deferred or tax-free growth, asset protection, and [[estate planning]] benefits.

==Involuntary cash out distributions==

A defined contribution plan may involuntarily cash out, also described as force out, the accounts of ex-employee participants with a balance of $7,000 or less.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/publications/p560| title=Publication 560 (2024), Retirement Plans for Small Business| publisher=IRS| accessdate=September 2, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt; This amount was increased from $5,000 in the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SECURE_2.0_Act SECURE 2.0 Act], effective January 1, 2024.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://keitercpa.com/blog/benefit-plan-5-reasons-leverage-secure-2-0-cashout-change/| title=Benefit Plan Insights: 5 Reasons to Leverage SECURE 2.0 Act’s Cashout Limit Change| publisher=Keiter CPAs| author=Rachel Gonner| date=April 18, 2024| accessdate=September 2, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the balance is between $1,000 and $7,000, then the employer must notify the participant and must provide for the automatic rollover to an [[IRA]] or annuity, unless the participant chooses otherwise. Balances of less than $1,000 may be distributed as cash/check to the participant; this will result in an [[401(k)#Early_withdrawals_and_loans|early withdrawal]] penalty and a taxable event.

A 401(k) plan is not ''required'' to make these distributions, but they ''may'', and many plans do so to reduce administrative costs of running the plans. Therefore, if you have 401(k) balances of $7,000 or less with former employers you should know the rules of your former plan(s) so you can manage your accounts successfully. If you have balances of $1,000 or less you must take extra care to monitor your accounts to ensure that they are not cashed out.

The best way to ensure a small-balance account is handled according to your investment goals is to roll the balance over to an IRA or to a new defined contribution plan (if applicable and if the plan accepts rollovers).

==Required Minimum Distributions==
{{Main|Required Minimum Distribution}}

You must begin making distributions from a traditional 401(k) at least no later than the year after the year you turn 73 unless you are still employed at the company sponsoring the 401(k) plan. The minimum RMD age increases to 75 in 2033. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://natlawreview.com/article/secure-20-series-part-3-retirement-plan-required-minimum-distribution-age-to?amp | title= SECURE 2.0 Series Part 3: Retirement Plan Required Minimum Distribution Age to Increase to 75 | publisher=National Law Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of the distribution is based on life expectancy according to the relevant factors from the [[IRA Distribution Tables | appropriate IRS tables]]. The only exception to minimum distribution is for people still working once they reach that age, and the exception only applies to the current plan they are participating in. There is a penalty for failing to make the minimum distribution. The penalty is 25% of the amount that should have been distributed, reduced to 10% if corrected within two years. Prior to 2024, RMDs were also required in Roth 401(k)s. Starting in 2024 and later years, RMDs are no longer required from designated Roth 401(k) and 403(b) accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/retirement-plan-and-ira-required-minimum-distributions-faqs#:~:text=Designated%20Roth%20accounts%20in%20a,required%20from%20designated%20Roth%20accounts | title= Retirement plan and IRA Required Minimum Distributions FAQs | publisher=Internal Revenue Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beneficiaries==

If you die while holding the plan, your designated beneficiaries may rollover their inherited balance to an IRA, which will be treated as an inherited IRA.

===Successor beneficiaries===
If the designated beneficiary stays in the plan, successor beneficiaries of the designated beneficiary may not rollover an inherited balance to an IRA, per Sec 402(c)(11). A 401(k) plan ''may'', however, choose to allow successor beneficiaries to stay in the plan, and take required minimum distribution requirements using the same schedule that the original designated beneficiary was using.&lt;ref&gt;{{forum link|p=2214160|title=TSP Beneficiary Account and Tax Burden to Successors|author=Alan S|date=October 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Expensive or mediocre choices==
Even in a bad 401(k), you should contribute up to the company match. Choose the lowest-cost funds; many bad 401(k)s have a few lower-cost funds. If you are eligible, additional contributions should usually go into a Roth or Traditional IRA. But unless your 401(k) is very bad and you expect to stay a very long time with the same employer, investing unmatched money in the 401(k) is likely to be better than taxable investing, because you can roll over your 401(k) to a low-cost IRA when you leave.

A reasonable rule-of-thumb is to consider investing in a taxable account if the product of the extra costs and the number of years you will stay in the plan exceeds one and a half times your combined federal and state tax rates on qualified dividends over your working career. That is, if you pay 1.70% expenses rather than 0.20%, and you pay 15% federal tax on qualified dividends, plus 5% state tax, you should still invest in the plan unless you are reasonably certain that you will stay with the employer for more than 20 years for a net loss of 30% (actually 26% because of compounding). If you pay no state tax, you should still invest in the plan unless you are reasonably certain you will stay more than 15 years.

The reason for the rule of thumb is that a long-term investment, even in a tax-efficient stock fund, is likely to lose more than your tax rate to taxes. You will pay tax every year on the dividends, continue to pay that tax after you leave the employer, and then pay capital-gains tax on most of the investment value when you sell the fund over the course of your retirement. (And if you retire in a 15% tax bracket and thus pay no capital gains on the fund sale, the lower tax bracket will also reduce the tax due on withdrawals from a 401(K), for a comparable tax savings.)&lt;ref group="note"&gt;[https://thefinancebuff.com/alternatives-to-a-high-cost-401k-or-403b-plan.html Alternatives to a High Cost 401(k) Or 403(b) Plan] at [https://thefinancebuff.com TheFinanceBuff.com] contains a spreadsheet which can be used to compare alternatives for your situation (July 23, 2008). The spreadsheet approximately agrees with the rule-of-thumb estimates for the common situation in which you have 20-30 years with the employer and then average about another 10 years in retirement.&lt;/ref&gt;

Now, before you consider forgoing your 401(k), you may want to talk to the human resources department to see if they can improve the 401(k) plan. You may want to suggest a low-cost plan like Employee Fiduciary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.employeefiduciary.com/| title=401(k) Plans for Small Businesses| publisher=Employee Fiduciary| accessdate=January 9, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt; You can find a sample letter to the human resources department at {{forum link| t=7573| title=401(k) links and suggestions}}. Keep in mind that the employer likely cares more about the cost of running the 401(k) plan than the expense ratios that the employees have to live with. For this reason, it is not a good idea to stress the problem with the expense ratios too much. (See [[How to campaign for a better 401(k) plan]] for more details, as well as [https://thefinancebuff.com/alternatives-to-a-high-cost-401k-or-403b-plan.html Alternatives to a High Cost 401(k) Or 403(b) Plan] for more guidance).

==Employer administration==
===Investment policy statements===
Employers are expected to have investment policy statements for the plan, governing the process by which investment selections are chosen and monitored on an ongoing basis.

===Timing of contributions===
Contributions deferred from an employee's pay must be contributed to the 401(k) plan and allocated to your account "as of the earliest date" the deferrals can be segregated from the employer's assets. According to Department of Labor regulation 2510.3-102, the "earliest date" is the earlier of (1) the first date reasonably practicable on an ongoing basis based on the routine processing of the payroll information, transmittal of data to the plan provider and processing by the provider or (2) the 15th business day of the month following the month in which the contribution was withheld from the employee's pay. Employers are violating ERISA and subject to 15% tax on the deemed interest when failing to contribute timely.

{{for|additional information|wikipedia:403(b)}}

The '''403(b)''' is a tax deferred, defined contribution plan available to [[403b plans for K-12 public school district employees|employees of educational institutions such as public school districts]] and certain (Internal Revenue Code section) 501(c)(3) non-profit groups, which include colleges, universities, hospitals, charities and the clergy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irs.gov/publications/p571/index.html  IRS Publication 571 Tax-Sheltered Annuity Plans(403(b)Plans)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plan basics==
Contributions to a 403(b) plan are tax-deductible, and any earnings accumulate tax-free until withdrawals are made. Withdrawals are taxed at ordinary income rates, and a 10% penalty tax is assessed on withdrawals made prior to the age of 59 ½.  In 2026, catch-up contributions must be made to a Roth account if the employee's 2025 salary was more than $150,000.

Employees may contribute up to 100% of their salaries, subject to the following limits:

{{Retirement Plan Contribution Limits}}
===Roth 403(b)===

Beginning in 2006, 403(b) plans have been allowed the option of providing a Roth 403(b).  The Roth 403(b) allows individuals to contribute after-tax dollars to grow tax free and, generally, not be taxed upon withdrawal.&lt;ref group="note"&gt; A qualified Roth 403(b) distribution is generally a distribution that is made after a 5-taxable-year period of participation and is either:
#made on or after the date you attain age 59½
#made after your death, or
#attributable to your being disabled.
When you roll over a distribution from a designated Roth account to a Roth IRA, the period that the rolled-over funds were in the designated Roth account '''does not count''' toward the 5-taxable-year period for determining qualified distributions from the Roth IRA. However, if you had contributed to any Roth IRA in a prior year, the 5-taxable-year period for determining qualified distributions from a Roth IRA is measured from the earlier contribution. So, if the earlier contribution was made more than 5 years ago and you are over 59 ½ a distribution of amounts attributable to a rollover contribution from a designated Roth account would be a qualified distribution from the Roth IRA.&lt;br&gt;
If you take a distribution from your designated Roth account before the end of the 5-taxable-year period, it is a nonqualified distribution. You must include the earnings portion of the nonqualified distribution in gross income. However, the basis (or contributions) portion of the nonqualified distribution is not included in gross income. The basis portion of the distribution is determined by multiplying the amount of the nonqualified distribution by the ratio of designated Roth contributions to the total designated Roth account balance.&lt;br&gt; 
For example, if a nonqualified distribution of $5,000 is made from your designated Roth account when the account consists of $9,400 of designated Roth contributions and $600 of earnings, the distribution consists of $4,700 of designated Roth contributions (that are not includible in your gross income) and $300 of earnings (that are includible in your gross income). See [http://www.irs.gov/Retirement-Plans/Retirement-Plans-FAQs-on-Designated-Roth-Accounts#distns FAQ's on Designated Roth Accounts], IRS. &lt;/ref&gt;
If the plan contains a Roth option, an employee can direct 403(b) contributions to a regular 403(b), a Roth 403(b), or some combination of the two plans; the total contribution cannot exceed the annual contribution limit.&lt;ref name="FAQ"&gt;[http://www.403bwise.com/participants/getwise_faq.html 403bwise FAQ]&lt;/ref&gt;

A Roth 403(b) is no longer subject to required minimum distributions during the owner's lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irs.gov/Retirement-Plans/Retirement-Plans-FAQs-regarding-Required-Minimum-Distributions Retirement Plans FAQs regarding Required Minimum Distributions], IRS &lt;/ref&gt;

A Roth 403(b) may be attractive under the following circumstances:
* If you expect your tax rate in retirement will be higher than it had been during the years you contributed.
* If you are young and want to use a long investment horizon to accumulate tax-free earnings under a Roth feature.
* If you are a highly compensated individual who would like to have a pool of tax-free money to draw upon after retirement, and who are not eligible for Roth IRAs due to the income limitations.
* If you want to leave tax-free money to heirs.

===Fifteen year rule===

Employees with 15 or more years of service with public school systems, hospitals, home health service agencies, health and welfare agencies, churches, or convention or associations of churches may be able to qualify for a Salary Reduction Catch-Up.  This option is only available to those whose prior contributions have averaged less than $5,000 per year.  If this qualification is met, the employee may be able to defer an extra $3,000 per annum in catch-up contributions (to a lifetime maximum of $15,000).&lt;ref name="FAQ"/&gt; In the ordering of contributions, the IRS deems that the 15 year service catch-up contributions precede the age 50 catch-up contributions.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.403bwise.com/participants/getwise_faq.html#faq28 How much can be contributed to a 403(b)], 403(b)wise.com, FAQ &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt; For detailed rules regarding the Fifteen Year Rule consult [http://www.irs.gov/publications/p571/ch04.html#en_US_201212_publink1000239675 Publication 571] '' Tax Sheltered Annuity Plans (403(b)Plans)'', IRS &lt;/ref&gt; 

{| class="wikitable"
|''Example'':
Andrea Miller, age 51, makes a $22,500 contribution to her 403(b) plan in 2016. The IRS allocates the contribution as follows:
* Regular contribution : $18,000
* 15 year service catch-up: $3,000
* Over 50 catch-up: $1,500
Andrea Miller's remaining lifetime 15 year service catch-up total is reduced to $12,000.
|}

===Distributions===
Basic rules regarding distributions from a 403(b) plan include:

* A withdrawal of assets prior to age 59-1/2, will be taxable at income tax rates and will result in the IRS imposing a 10 percent penalty tax (unless certain criteria are met.)&lt;ref group="note"&gt; Withdrawals are taxable unless you meet one of the following exclusions:
*Attain age 59-1/2
*Separate from service in or after the year in which you reach age 55
*Part of a series of substantially equal periodic payments for your life or the joint lives of you and your designated beneficiary
*Hardship
*Disability
*Death
*Made due to an IRS levy upon your participant account
*Paid to an alternative payee under a qualified domestic relations order
*Is a qualified reservist distribution as defined under the Pension Protection Act of 2006
*Is a payment of qualified medical expenses greater than 7.2% of your adjusted gross income. 
Source: [http://www.403bwise.com/participants/getwise_faq.html 403bwise FAQ] &lt;/ref&gt;

* Penalty-free withdrawals are allowed upon retirement (assumed to be in or after the year in which you reach age 55).&lt;ref name="FAQ"/&gt;
* Generally, required minimum distributions, must begin from a 403(b) no later than April 1 of the year following the year in which an individual turns age 73. If you are still working, you can delay withdrawal from your 403(b) until April 1 following the year in which you retire.&lt;ref name="FAQ"/&gt;
* 403(b) account balances that existed on December 31, 1986 are not subject to the age 70-1/2 distribution requirement. However, any earnings on that balance are. Distribution from the 12/31/86 balance needs to start at age 75. (This situation is complex, and consulting a professional tax advisor is recommended.)&lt;ref name="FAQ"/&gt;

If you own more than one 403(b), required minimum distributions are calculated in a manner similar to an IRA. You must calculate the RMD separately for each 403(b) contract that you own, but can take the total amount from one or more of the 403(b) contracts.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;This is similar to an IRA, where an IRA owner must calculate the RMD separately for each IRA that they own, but can withdraw the total amount from one or more of the IRAs. However, RMDs required from other types of retirement plans, such as 401(k) and 457(b) plans have to be taken separately from each of those plan accounts. Reference: [http://www.irs.gov/Retirement-Plans/Retirement-Plans-FAQs-regarding-Required-Minimum-Distributions#5 Retirement Plans FAQs regarding Required Minimum Distributions], from the IRS.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transfers===
{{401k rollover infobox}}
A number of tax-free transfers and rollovers of 403(b) plans are permissible under the tax laws.

* '''Contract exchanges'''.   If you transfer all or part of your interest from a 403(b) contract to another 403(b) contract (held in the same plan), the transfer is tax free, and is referred to as a contract exchange. This was previously known as a 90-24 transfer. A contract exchange is similar to a 90-24 transfer with one major difference. Previously, you were able to accomplish the transfer without your employer’s involvement. After September 24, 2007, all such transfers are accomplished through a contract exchange requiring your employer’s involvement. In addition, the plan must provide for the exchange and the transferred interest must be subject to the same or stricter distribution restrictions. Finally, your accumulated benefit after the exchange must be equal to what it was before the exchange.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irs.gov/publications/p571/ch08.html#en_US_201212_publink1000239748 IRS Pub 571]&lt;/ref&gt;
* If you leave your employer assets can be transferred to your new employer's defined contribution plan, if permitted by that plan.&lt;ref name="FAQ"/&gt;
* After leaving your employer, assets may be moved to a Rollover Individual Retirement Account (IRA).&lt;ref name="FAQ"/&gt;

==Advantages==
The advantages a 403(b) plan offers include the following.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.investopedia.com/articles/retirement/10/top-9-benefits-403b-plans.asp Top 9 Benefits Of A 403(b) plan], Eric Fontinelle, (April 6, 2010), investipedia &lt;/ref&gt;

* High contribution limits allow an individual to tax defer more investment dollars than can be contributed to individual retirement plans.
* Contributions to a regular 403(b) are tax deductible. Tax deductible contributions are especially advantageous if the tax rate is lower when retirement income withdrawals are made. If a Roth option is available, contributions made at low tax rates are advantageous if the tax rate is higher when retirement withdrawals are made.
* Contributions made to a 403(b) qualify for the Retirement Savings Contributions Credit ([[Saver's credit|Saver's Credit]]) if you meet the filing and income requirements.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.irs.gov/publications/p571/ch10.html Retirement Savings Contributions Credit (Saver's Credit)], Publication 571, IRS &lt;/ref&gt; 
* Employer's can make [[Employer matching contributions|matching contributions]] to employee contributions.
* Some plans may have loan provisions.&lt;ref group="note"&gt; IRS stipulations regarding 403(b)loans limits loans to the lesser of:
*$50,000
*One half of account value
The individual vendor may put additional restrictions on loan provisions. See [http://403bwise.com/participants/getwise_403b_access.html assessing 403(b)savings],  403(b)wise.com &lt;/ref&gt;
* If a 403(b) plan offers very low-cost investment options (such as those offered by [[TIAA-CREF]] in the university retirement plan market, or by a low cost mutual fund company) investors can reap most of the returns investment markets provide. Unfortunately, the 403(b) marketplace, especially in the K-12 school environment, is primarily populated by high cost, commissioned annuity products.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.403bwise.com/participants/getwise_reading.html must reads], 403(b)wise.com. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; ''[http://www.403bwise.com/pdf/who_is_watching_door_full.pdf Whose Watching The Door? How Controlling Provider Access Can Improve K-12 Teacher Retirement Outcomes]'', Research Dialogue, Issue No,. 98, TIAA-CREF Institute &lt;/ref&gt;
* 403(b) plans allow employees who have fifteen years of service to an employer to make up to $15,000 of catch up contributions to the plan.
* Participants who are eligible for both a 403(b) and a [[457(b)|457(b)]] through their employer can contribute the maximum of both plans, which at $23,000 each is a combined $46,000.&lt;ref group="note"&gt; See [http://www.457bwise.com/faqs/index.html#contributeboth 457(b)wise] FAQ for more information on 457(b) plans &lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
[[File:Fees-impact-return.gif|thumb|right|450px|Value after 35 years, assuming $250 contributed monthly with an 8 percent average annual return.]]
Since the 403(b) is heavily tied to the insurance industry,&lt;ref group="note"&gt; '''History of the 403(b) Plan'''
*403(b) programs were originally created in 1958 by Congress for employees of tax-exempt corporations. 
*In 1961, public education institutions, including public school districts, became eligible to offer 403(b) plans. 
*In 1973, Congress passed a law allowing employees to make tax-free exchanges of the full account value from one 403(b) plan to another, and partial transfers have been allowed since 1992. 
*In 1974, Congress passed the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), which included a provision allowing 403(b) plans to increase the number of their investment options and offer mutual funds in addition to annuities. 
*In 1978, a law was passed allowing employees to roll 403(b) assets into a traditional IRA. 
*Starting in 1982, with the passage of the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act, 403(b) participants were allowed to take loans from their plans. Additionally, religious organizations were permitted to set up Retirement Income Accounts, a specialized form of 403(b) plan. 
*In 1986, another tax law imposed restrictions on withdrawals before age 59½ and made them subject to a 10 percent early withdrawal penalty. Additionally, required minimum distributions (after age 70½) were established along with new limits on elective deferrals. The limit established then, $9,500 per person per year, remained in effect until 1998. 
*A 1992 IRS ruling allowed employees to make tax-free full or partial account transfers from annuities to 403(b)(7) mutual fund accounts. 
*The 2001 tax bill, which took effect in 2002, allowed 403(b) participants to roll their money into a 401(k) or governmental 457 plan when changing jobs, in addition to an IRA or other 403(b). Similarly, employees with savings in 401(k) or governmental 457 plans may roll their contributions into a 403(b) plan, if offered by their new employer. The tax bill also simplified the formula used to calculate an employee's annual contribution limit. 
* On July 23, 2007, the IRS finalized new regulations (set to go into full effect January 1, 2009) for public 403(b) retirement plans. The main highlights include:
** Requirement that a 403(b) program be maintained pursuant to a written plan which satisfies section 403(b) in both form and operation and contains all the terms and conditions for eligibility, limitations, and benefits under the plan.
** End to traditional 90-24 outside-of-plan transfers.
** Requirement to provide annual notification of eligibility
** Clarification of universal availability
** New information sharing requirements between employers and vendors.

*[http://www.403bwise.com/employers/getwise_regulations.html Overview of new rules], 403(b)wise&lt;/ref&gt; a common option of 403(b) plans is a tax-sheltered [[Fixed Annuity |fixed annuity]] or a [[Variable Annuity | variable annuity]]. These products often come with an extra layer of fees and restrictions such as surrender charges;&lt;ref group="note"&gt; According to the SEC [http://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/teacheroptions.htm Evaluating Your Retirement Options]:{{blockquote| 
For example, if you withdraw money from a variable annuity within a certain period after a purchase payment (typically within six to eight years, but sometimes as long as ten years), the insurance company usually will assess a "surrender" charge. A surrender charge is a type of sales charge that compensates the financial professional who sold the variable annuity to you. Generally, the surrender charge is a percentage of the amount you sell or exchange, and it will decline gradually over a period of several years, known as the "surrender period." For example, a 7% charge might apply in the first year after a purchase payment, 6% in the second year, 5% in the third year, and so on until the eighth year, when the surrender charge no longer applies. Some variable annuity contracts will allow you to withdraw part of your account value each year — 10% or 15% of your account value, for example — without paying a surrender charge.}}&lt;/ref&gt; furthermore, the extra tax-deferral features of the annuity are unnecessary since the 403(b) is already a tax-deferred account.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.403bwise.com/participants/getwise_investment_annuities.html Investment Basics: Why Annuities Rarely Make Sense in a 403(b)], 403(b)wise.com. &lt;/ref&gt;

Mutual funds are a possible option (known as 403(b)(7) custodial accounts) only if they are an available option within the plan. If mutual funds are not available in the 403(b) the participant should consider lobbying the employer to offer some lower fee mutual funds. If you are in this situation see [[How to campaign for a better 403(b) plan]] for information on how to proceed.

&lt;onlyinclude&gt;Created in 1978, a '''457(b)''' plan is a non-qualified tax-deferred compensation plan similar to qualified plans such as the [[401(k)]] and [[403(b)]]. If you work for a state or local government or for a tax-exempt organization, you may be able to participate in a  section 457 deferred compensation plan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/457 26 USC § 457 - Deferred compensation plans of State and local governments and tax-exempt organizations], Legal Information Institute, Cornell Law School &lt;/ref&gt; The 457 plan may be available as an additional voluntary retirement savings vehicle for state or local government or tax-exempt organization employers also offering a public employees pension system. Or they can be offered as a supplemental retirement option for those state or local government or tax-exempt organization employers offering a 401(k) or 403(b) plan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.457bwise.com/faqs/index.html 403(b)wise. 457 FAQ] &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;&lt;!--- used for retirement plan overview --&gt;

Although 457 plans rarely provide an employer matching contribution, there is no federal 10 percent premature distribution penalty imposed on withdrawals from a 457(b) plan when separating from service.&lt;ref&gt;[https://403bwise.com/k12/content/18 403(b)wise. 457b]&lt;/ref&gt;

As always, costs matter, so before investing evaluate the fees and expenses of the investment options available in the 457 plan you are considering. Each plan chooses which investment alternatives to offer eligible employees, so fund choices and associated fees and expenses can vary.

&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;!--- used for retirement plan overview --&gt;
There are two basic types of 457 plans:
:*''' Government Plans''': Local and state governments are eligible to establish a 457(b) plan for their employees. This type of 457(b) covers employees of a state (including the District of Columbia), a political subdivision of a state, any agency or instrumentality of a state, or political subdivision of a state. These types of employees can include: local and state government workers, fire fighters, police personnel, and public school employees. 

::Section 1448 of the Small Business Jobs Protection Act of 1996 (SBJPA) added 457(g) of the Code, which requires that 457(b) plans maintained by state or local government employers hold all plan assets and income in trust, or in custodial accounts or annuity contracts (described in 401(f) of the Code), for the exclusive benefit of their participants and beneficiaries. 

::Contributions to the 457(b) plan qualify for the [[Saver's credit|saver's credit]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irs.gov/publications/p571/ch10.html Pub 571 savers credit], IRS &lt;/ref&gt;
:* '''Non-Government Plans''': Tax-exempt organizations that are non-governmental (hospitals, charitable organizations, unions, among others) must generally limit participation to a select group of management or highly compensated employees. This is due to the rules under Title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA).

::ERISA generally requires that a private retirement plan providing benefits to employees be funded by a trust or annuity contract. The rules, however, require that private 457(b) plans be unfunded in order to obtain tax benefits. Therefore, a plan will violate ERISA unless an exception applies. This provision means that the 457 plan assets are the property of the sponsoring employer and are subject to the employer's general creditors, until paid out to plan participants.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/non-governmental-457b-deferred-compensation-plans. IRS Non_ Governmental 457b Deferred Compensation Plans]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;&lt;!--- used for retirement plan overview --&gt;

Each 457 plan is required to have a written plan document. It is essential to refer to this document for the details on how your 457 plan operates, including the investment options offered by the plan, fees and expenses, and specific withdrawal options.&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

===Roth 457(b)===
If an employer offers a Roth 457(b) provision, an employee can designate all or a portion of their 457(b) as an after-tax Roth contribution. These contributions are made with after tax earnings. Unlike the advantage a pre-tax 457(b) has over pre-tax 401(k) and 403(b) plans, withdrawals from a Roth 457(b) are subject to the same age 59.5 restrictions as other Roth plans.  Worse yet for those taking pre-59.5 withdrawals, Roth 457(b) distributions are taken on a pro-rata basis between contributions and gains, unlike the "contributions first" treatment given to Roth IRA distributions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=222789 Roth 457 vs. Roth IRA - Bogleheads.org]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Employees have the option of making pre-tax 457(b) contributions, Roth 457(b) contributions, or a combination of the two. Total contributions cannot exceed the year's contribution limit.&lt;ref&gt;[https://403bwise.com/k12/content/18 457(b)], 403(b)wise.com. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Contributions==
The contribution limits are the same as for other employer plans.  However, participants may invest the maximum allowable contribution in both a 457 plan and a [[401(k)]] or [[403(b) | 403(b)]] plan of both are available.  The combined maximum contribution for 2026 is thus $49,000. The [[#Catch up provision |"final three year"]] and Age 50+
catch-up cannot be used in the same tax year.&lt;ref&gt;[https://dcprovider.com/PDF/tn/Tenn_Plan_Comparison_FINAL_03182013.pdf Comparison of the Governmental 457(b) and 401(k) Plans]&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the age 50+  and 60-63 higher limits are only applicable to governmental 457 plans, not to non-governmental plans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Non-governmental 457(b) deferred compensation plans|url=https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/non-governmental-457b-deferred-compensation-plans|access-date=June 25, 2025|website=Internal Revenue Service}}&lt;/ref&gt; The table below reflects 457 plan contribution limits, again noting that 50+ and 60-63 catchup contributions aren’t applicable to non-governmental 457 plans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=What is a 457(b) plan and how does it work?|url=https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/smart-money/what-is-a-457b|access-date=June 25, 2025|website=Fidelity Investments}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Catch-up contributions for 2026 must be made to a Roth account if the employee's 2025 salary was over $150,000.

{{Retirement Plan Contribution Limits}}
===Catch up provision===
The 457(b) plan often contains a special "catch-up" provision called the "final three year" provision for those approaching retirement (assuming they haven't contributed the maximum amount in prior years). Employers are not required to offer this provision. For those that do, the "catch-up" provision kicks in during the three years prior to "normal" retirement age (as defined in the plan). This provision, now permits up to 200% of the elective deferral limit, or $47,000 in 2025, $49,000 in 2026.

{{Notice|''Example'': Victor will reach "normal" retirement age in 2021; under his plan he can take advantage of the "final three year" provision in years 2018, 2019, and 2020. If Victor takes advantage of this provision he cannot also take advantage of the "Age 50 catch-up" provision. Note: to determine the underutilized amounts in prior years all of the prior coordination rules apply.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.457bwise.com/faqs/index.html 457bwise. 457 FAQ]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Investment options==
457(b) plans can be funded with:
:*Group [[Fixed annuity|fixed]] and [[Variable annuity|variable annuities]]
:*Retail [[Mutual fund|mutual funds]]
:*Bank instruments
:*A combination of all three

==Withdrawals==
Government 457(b) plans are subject to income tax upon withdrawal but are not subject to the 10% early withdrawal penalty. Funds can be withdrawn at retirement, upon severance from the employer, upon death, upon disability, and under stringent hardship withdrawal rules. Funds must be withdrawn at age 73 (unless you are still working) and are subject to the [[IRA distribution tables|required minimum distributions]] rules.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irs.gov/Retirement-Plans/Retirement-Plans-FAQs-regarding-Required-Minimum-Distributions Retirement Plans FAQs regarding Required Minimum Distributions], IRS &lt;/ref&gt; Different rules apply if you work for a tax-exempt organization (you must see the employer plan document for the details.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.457bwise.com/faqs/index.html 403(b)wise. 457 FAQ]&lt;/ref&gt;
  
===Hardship withdrawals===
The IRS has strict guidelines for allowable hardship withdrawals:

Under a 457(b) plan, a hardship distribution can only occur when the participant is faced with an unforeseeable emergency. (Code § 457(d)(1)(iii))

An unforeseeable emergency is a severe financial hardship resulting from an illness or accident, loss of property due to casualty, or other similar extraordinary and unforeseeable circumstances arising as a result of events beyond the control of the participant or beneficiary. Examples of events that may be considered unforeseeable emergencies include imminent foreclosure on, or eviction from, the employee's home, medical expenses, and funeral expenses. Generally, the purchase of a home and the payment of college tuition are not unforeseeable emergencies.
(Reg. § 1.457-6(c)(2)(i))

Whether a participant or beneficiary is faced with an unforeseeable emergency depends on the facts and circumstances. However, a distribution is not on account of an unforeseeable emergency to the extent that the emergency can be relieved through reimbursement or compensation from insurance, liquidation of the participant's assets, or cessation of deferrals under the plan. (Reg. § 1.457-6(c)(2)(ii))

A distribution on account of an unforeseeable emergency must not exceed the amount reasonably necessary to satisfy the emergency need. (Reg. § 1.457-6(c)(2)(iii))&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irs.gov/retirement/article/0,,id=162416,00.html IRS Retirement Plans FAQs regarding Hardship Distributions]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rollovers==
{{401k rollover infobox}}
An employer is not required to accept rollover contributions, so it is necessary to check a 457(b) plan's written document for its rules on plan rollovers.
 
Rollover provisions are more liberal for a government 457(b) plan than for non-government 457 plans. A government 457(b) plan can be rolled over to another employer's 457 plan, a 401(k) plan, a 403(b) plan or a rollover [[Traditional IRA|traditional IRA.]] However, assets transferred out of the 457 into a non 457 plan will lose the exemption to the early withdrawal penalty that 457 plans enjoy. Likewise, if you roll non 457 plan assets into an employer provided 457 plan, these assets do not gain exemption from the early withdrawal penalty.

Non-government 457 plans can only be rolled over to another non government 457 plan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p4484.pdf  IRS:Choose a Retirement Plan]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{for|additional information|wikipedia:Health savings account}}

A '''{{PAGENAME}} (HSA)''' is a special account which is used in conjunction with a [[High deductible health plan | high deductible health plan]]. Unlike a [[Flexible spending arrangement  | flexible spending account]], unused money remains in the account and can be invested; most accounts offer either [[mutual fund]]s or brokerage accounts for investing. 

HSAs are often referred to as "triple-tax advantaged", a feature that makes them unique among all investment accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/19/business/health-savings-accounts-tax-break.html|title=The Triple Tax Break You May Be Missing: A Health Savings Account|publisher=The New York Times|date=March 19, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contributions are tax-deductible on federal and most state tax returns; earnings and withdrawals are also tax-free if used for medical expenses. After age 65, you can use HSAs for non-medical purposes, with these withdrawals taxed like a traditional IRA. For this reason, investors should usually contribute to an HSA [[#Contribution_priority_compared_to_other_accounts|before]] making [[Employer matching contributions|unmatched]] retirement account contributions.

You must be covered by a [[high deductible health plan]] to make HSA contributions. Unlike most health insurance, the high deductible plan pays nothing except for preventive care until you meet a fairly high deductible. Determine if this type of plan is appropriate for your personal circumstances and health care needs. If it is, then using the HSA as an investment account can be advantageous.

==How an HSA works==

[https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p969.pdf IRS Publication 969] contains the details of how HSAs work.

===Basics===

You are eligible to contribute to an HSA if you meet the following requirements:
*You are covered under a [[high deductible health plan]], or (starting in 2026) any Catastrophic or Bronze plan from the Affordable Care Act marketplace.
*You have no other health coverage, except for dental, vision, and other specific exceptions
*Neither you '''nor your spouse''' participates in a general purpose [[Flexible spending arrangement|Flexible Spending Account (FSA)]] (because an FSA can be used to reimburse a spouse's medical expenses)
*You are not enrolled in [[Medicare]]
*You are not eligible to be claimed as a dependent on someone else’s tax return

You may withdraw from the HSA tax-free to reimburse qualified medical expenses, even if you are no longer eligible to contribute. Notably, there is no time limit for how long you can wait to withdraw money to reimburse yourself for the expense. This feature allows a [[#Maxing_out_retirement_accounts|strategy]] where you can save receipts for eligible expenses for years or decades, while letting the HSA grow tax-deferred. You can then withdraw from the HSA tax-free later in life for past medical expenses and retirement medical expenses.

You pay tax on withdrawals for other purposes as ordinary income, with an extra 20% penalty. The penalty is waived if you are at least 65 or disabled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p969.pdf|title=Publication 969, Health Savings Accounts and Other Tax-Favored Health Plans|publisher=IRS|accessdate=June 25, 2024|page=10|quote=Additional Tax ... Exceptions. There is no additional tax on distributions made after the date you are disabled, reach age 65, or die.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because withdrawals after age 65 are taxable but penalty-free, the account can also behave like a [[traditional IRA]] when used this way. Because these features allow additional tax-advantaged retirement savings, HSAs are sometimes referred to as "Stealth IRAs".

===Contribution limits===

The 2025 annual limit is $4,400 for an individual plan, or $8,750 for a family plan&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/rp-25-19.pdf|title=IRS Revenue Procedure 2025-19|publisher=IRS|accessdate=27 November 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt; (defined as covering an eligible individual plus at least one other individual), plus $1,000 catch-up contributions if you are at least 55. Contribution limits include both contributions from the HSA participant as well as employer contributions, which are not included in your taxable income.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|format=pdf|url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p969.pdf|title=Publication 969, Health Savings Accounts and Other Tax-Favored Health Plans|publisher=IRS|accessdate=June 25, 2024|page=7|quote=Reporting Contributions on Your Return. Contributions made by your employer aren't included in your income. Contributions to an employee's account by an employer using the amount of an employee's salary reduction through a cafeteria plan are treated as employer contributions. Generally, you can claim contributions you made and contributions made by any other person, other than your employer, on your behalf, as an adjustment to income.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning with the first month you are enrolled in Medicare, your contribution limit is zero.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|format=pdf|url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p969.pdf|title=Publication 969, Health Savings Accounts and Other Tax-Favored Health Plans|publisher=IRS|accessdate=June 25, 2024|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contributions for a family plan only get one $1,000 catch-up even if both spouses are age 55+. This limitation can be circumvented by the other spouse opening up an HSA in their name and contributing $1,000 (or more, as long as the total contributions for both spouses do not exceed the family plan limit plus two catch-ups). HSA contributions have no minimum or maximum income, and these contributions will reduce taxable income on a Married Filing Jointly tax return even if the other spouse has no income. HSAs are always individually-titled accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Forum post|t=411068|title=HSA catch-up contributions for couple (both 55+)|date=August 19, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If you are enrolled in an HDHP for only part of the year, the maximum contribution amount varies based on several factors. The '''last-month rule''' lets you contribute the full annual contribution for a tax year if you are eligible to contribute on December 1st of that year, as long as you remain eligible to contribute through December 31st of the ''following'' year. The last-month rule also lets you contribute the family limit for the year if you have family HDHP coverage on December 1st, even if you only had individual coverage earlier in the year. For more complicated situations involving part-year coverage and/or changing between individual and family coverage, the annual limit is prorated by month;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://livelyme.com/blog/hsa-contribution-limits-mid-year-changes|title=Mid-year HSA Changes: How Status Affects Annual Contribution Limits|format=|page=|publisher=Lively Inc.|accessdate=June 26, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt; see [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p969.pdf IRS Publication 969] for specifics.

If you or your spouse have a general-purpose healthcare FSA, you are both ineligible to contribute to an HSA. However, a [[Flexible_spending_arrangement#Limited-purpose_FSA|limited-purpose FSA]], such as a Dependent Care FSA, does not disqualify anyone from contributing to an HSA.

A non-dependent child who is still covered only by a parent's HDHP (in other words, meets the requirements listed under [[#Basics|basic HSA rules]]) may contribute the ''family'' maximum to their own HSA. The child's HSA is completely separate from the parent's HSA.

You have until April 15th of the following year to contribute to your HSA for a given tax year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p969.pdf|title=Publication 969, Health Savings Accounts and Other Tax-Favored Health Plans|publisher=IRS|accessdate=June 25, 2024|page=8|quote=When To Contribute: You can make contributions to your HSA for 2023 through April 15, 2024. If you fail to be an eligible individual during 2023, you can still make contributions through April 15, 2024, for the months you were an eligible individual.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tax considerations===

Unlike many other tax deductions, there are no income restrictions to contribute to an HSA. Contributions to an HSA reduce your federal adjusted gross income (AGI) dollar for dollar, possibly making you eligible for income-based credits or [[Roth IRA]] contributions you would not otherwise be eligible for without the HSA deduction.

If your employer allows it, you can make your own contributions through pre-tax [[payroll deduction]]; this has the potential advantage that these contributions, like pre-tax insurance premiums, are not subject to [[Social Security]] and Medicare taxes (collectively known as [[Payroll - FICA tax deductions|payroll or FICA taxes]]), so long as the plan is classified as a Section 125 or "cafeteria" plan. If you are below the Social Security Wage Base, the reduction in Social Security taxes may reduce your future Social Security benefits. The [[Social Security as an investment|benefit or drawback of saving Social Security tax]] depends on your lifetime earning record. Generally, high earners come out ahead by avoiding FICA taxes, low earners come out behind, and middle earners come close to breaking even. See: [[Social Security as an investment]] and [[#Contribution_priority_compared_to_other_accounts|below]]. 

===State taxation of HSAs===

While contributions are deductible on your federal income tax, this is not always true for [[State income taxes|state income tax]]. The following states do not conform to federal legislation and do not recognize HSAs, so contributions are not deductible and earnings are taxable:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hsaforamerica.com/state-income-tax.htm|title=HSA State Income Tax|publisher=HSA For America}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*California
*New Jersey 

If you live in one of these states you must treat the HSA as a [[taxable account]] for state tax purposes, and keep track of [[Specific identification of shares|tax lots]], dividends, capital gains, distributions, and so on within the account. The IRS does not require HSA administrators to send you tax forms (such as 1099-INT or 1099-B), so you have to keep good records, track the state cost basis manually, and report any HSA investment income on your state tax return. If you live in one of these states, consider keeping your HSA investments especially simple to limit the work involved in this non-trivial task. 

You may be able to include amounts paid for medical expenses as an itemized deduction on the state tax return, subject to AGI floors, but only in the year you incurred the expense.

If you live in one of these states, consider investing the HSA in [[Treasury bonds]] or [[TIPS]], which are exempt from state taxes. (In California, you would pay state tax on capital gains issued by a TIPS/Treasury mutual fund or capital gain/loss on the sale of Treasury mutual fund shares, but even if you do, most of the returns from Treasury bonds and TIPS would be income which is not subject to state tax. New Jersey exempts capital gains on Treasuries from state tax.) [[Tax loss harvesting]] may be possible on the state tax return if you have capital gains or the state allows carryovers of capital losses. 

If you move from a state which does not tax HSAs to a state which taxes HSAs, sell any holdings with capital gains before you move, so that you will not pay taxes on the same capital gains when you sell the same holdings later as a resident of the state. You can buy back the same or similar holdings immediately after selling.

In states that tax contributions, be aware that Federal tax-free rollovers into an HSA, such as the once in a lifetime IRA to HSA rollover, and an Archer MSA to HSA rollover, are treated as a non-qualified withdrawal from the IRA/MSA at the state level and subject to income taxes and penalties on the state return. Also in states that tax contributions, the state treats the HSA as a taxable account, so that taxable investing rules apply.

===Withdrawals===

Withdrawals for qualified medical expenses (as outlined in [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p502.pdf IRS Publication 502, Medical and Dental Expenses]) that you, your spouse, and any dependents incur after you establish the HSA are tax-free. These include medical expenses you incur after you are no longer eligible to contribute to the HSA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/irb/2004-33_IRB/ar08.html|title=IRS Notice 2004-33|publisher=IRS|accessdate=June 25, 2024|quote=Question 39: ...}}&lt;/ref&gt; As long as you keep proper records, there is no limit for how long you can wait to reimburse yourself for qualified expenses. Medical expenses from before you established the HSA are ''not'' eligible for tax-free withdrawals, even if you had HDHP coverage and would have been eligible to contribute to an HSA. 

State law determines when an HSA is established. Most state laws require that a trust be funded to be established. This means that in most cases an HSA is not established until your first contribution goes into the HSA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.newfront.com/blog/hsa-establishment-date|title=HSA Establishment Date|publisher=Newfront|accessdate=August 5, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Withdrawals to pay for some types of medical insurance premiums are also tax-free. As detailed in [https://www.irs.gov/irb/2004-02_IRB#NOT-2004-2 Internal Revenue Bulletin 2004-2 (January 12, 2004) - Health Savings Accounts - Q&amp;A 27], you can use HSA funds to pay for qualified long-term care insurance (but only up to IRS specified dollar amounts), COBRA health care continuation coverage, and health care coverage while receiving unemployment compensation.  Furthermore, once reaching age 65, you can pay premiums for Medicare Part A or B, Medicare HMO, and the employee share of premiums for employer-sponsored health insurance (including premiums for employer-sponsored retiree health insurance) from an HSA. Premiums for Medigap policies are '''not''' qualified medical expenses and therefore cannot be paid tax-free from an HSA. 

There was further clarification in [https://www.irs.gov/irb/2008-29_IRB Internal Revenue Bulletin: 2008-29 (July 21, 2008) - Notice 2008-59 - Health Savings Accounts - Q&amp;A-29. Payment of Medicare Part D premiums]. This Q&amp;A clarified that Medicare Part D premiums are eligible expenses. The previous 2004 guidance had came out before Medicare Part D was established in 2006, therefore this guidance provided clarity for Medicare Part D premiums.

===Rollovers/Transfers===

You can move money between HSA custodians through direct rollovers and trustee-to-trustee transfers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p969.pdf|title=Publication 969, Health Savings Accounts and Other Tax-Favored Health Plans|publisher=IRS|accessdate=June 25, 2024|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rules are exactly the same as [[IRA Rollovers and Transfers]]. You may want to do this annually if you contribute to a plan through your employer's payroll deduction to gain the social security and medicare payroll tax exemption, but you do not want to leave the funds there long-term if the investment options are not good. The HSA custodian(s) may charge a fee for a trustee-to-trustee transfer; you can usually rollover directly without a fee.

You can make a once-in-a-lifetime rollover or transfer from an [[IRA]] to an HSA up to the annual HSA contribution limit. This is usually not a good idea, because you then lose the ability to contribute and take an HSA tax deduction for the amount you transfer, but it can be an emergency source of funds without paying taxes or penalties.&lt;ref name="thef_One-"&gt;{{Cite web | title = One-Time Transfer From IRA To HSA: Forget About It | author-link =The Finance Buff| first=Harry | last=Sit  | work = The Finance Buff | date = March 14, 2017 | accessdate = 2017-11-04 | url = https://thefinancebuff.com/one-time-transfer-from-ira-to-hsa-forget-about-it.html | quote =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; See [https://www.irs.gov/irb/2008-25_IRB/ar09.html IRS Notice 2008-51]. You can also roll over an Archer MSA to an HSA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p969.pdf|title=Publication 969, Health Savings Accounts and Other Tax-Favored Health Plans|publisher=IRS|accessdate=June 25, 2024|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; If you live in a [[#State_taxation_of_HSAs|state that taxes HSA contributions]], these rollovers have the additional drawback of incurring state taxes and penalties.

Social Security recipients 65 years of age or older are automatically enrolled in [[Medicare]] Part A and therefore ineligible to contribute to a Health Savings Account.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cms.gov/medicare/eligibility-and-enrollment/origmedicarepartabeligenrol/index.html|title=Original Medicare (Part A and B) Eligibility and Enrollment|publisher=Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services|accessdate=28 Aug 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aarp.org/health/medicare-insurance/info-04-2009/ask_ms_medicare_question_53.html|title=Can I Have a Health Savings Account as Well as Medicare?|publisher=AARP|accessdate=28 Aug 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

You must stop contributing to your HSA when you enroll in Medicare. However, you may use money that is already in your HSA after you enroll in Medicare to help pay for deductibles, premiums, copayments, or coinsurance.&lt;ref name="MedicareAndU"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.medicare.gov/pubs/pdf/10050-Medicare-and-You.pdf|title=Medicare and You|publisher=Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Service|accessdate=Nov 13, 2017}}, page 23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IRScontrib"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p969.pdf|title=Publication 969, Health Savings Accounts and Other Tax-Favored Health Plans|publisher=IRS|accessdate=June 25, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Premium-free Part A coverage begins six months back ''from the date you apply for Medicare'' (or Social Security/RRB benefits), but ''no earlier than the first month you were eligible for Medicare''. To avoid a tax penalty, make your last HSA contribution the month before your Part A coverage begins.&lt;ref name="MedicareAndU" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Forum post|p=3616132|title=Re: Medicare &lt;nowiki&gt;[Can I contribute to Health Savings Account?]&lt;/nowiki&gt;|author=Spirit Rider}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If you contribute to your HSA after your Medicare coverage starts, you may have to pay a tax penalty. Generally, you must pay a 6% excise tax on excess contributions. The excise tax applies to ''each tax year'' the excess contribution remains in the account.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p969.pdf|title=Publication 969, Health Savings Accounts and Other Tax-Favored Health Plans|publisher=IRS|accessdate=June 25, 2024|quote=Excess contributions ...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If you expect to have a [[#Overfunded_HSA|much larger HSA balance]] than your medical expenses, give consideration to using Medicare supplement plan G - high deductible. You would save on supplement premiums relative to the regular plan G and could use the HSA to pay deductibles. This would convert an expense that is not HSA-eligible (supplement premium) to an expense that is eligible (meeting deductible for part B services). Other, less generous and cheaper supplement plans might also be worth considering.

===Death of HSA holder===

A spouse beneficiary can inherit an HSA. Any other beneficiary will receive the HSA as a taxable distribution. See the Inherited HSA section [[#Inherited HSA|below]] for more details.

==How the account operates==

Details vary among HSA custodians, but in general you can withdraw no more than your current HSA balance.  This differs from [[Flexible spending arrangement#Distributions from an FSA|FSA distributions]] that allow withdrawals up to your planned contribution amount, even if you have not yet made all those contributions. The custodian may provide you with checks or a debit card to pay medical providers, and you can make online withdrawals from the HSA.

When you file taxes, [https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-8889 Form 8889] is how you tell the IRS how much of those withdrawals were for qualified medical expenses.

Some HSA custodians require you to keep a certain amount of your HSA as cash, while others allow you to invest using the same choices you would have with an IRA at that custodian.

You can choose your custodian, and transfer accounts between different custodians. However, if your health plan or employer makes a contribution, it may select the custodian to which it makes contributions, and may offer other incentives such as waiving service fees.

==How to use the plan==
{{See also|Emergency fund#Health savings account as an emergency fund | label 1=Health savings account as an emergency fund}}

There are two ways to use the HSA. You can either pay all your medical expenses from it, or pay out of pocket and save the plan money for medical expenses in retirement. Even if you use the HSA to pay current expenses, you will likely accumulate more than you spend, and can invest the remainder for medical expenses in retirement.

===Contribution priority compared to other accounts===
{{Main|Prioritizing investments}}

Usually, you should contribute to an [[Employer_retirement_plans_overview|employer retirement plan]] when you get a [[Employer_matching_contributions|match]], and pay off high-interest debts, before contributing to an HSA. But, you should contribute to an HSA before an employer plan when you do not get a match, or an [[IRA]]. The reason is that HSA contributions are tax-deductible, and if your medical expenses are high enough, the withdrawals can be tax-free too. With retirement accounts, either the contributions (pre-tax accounts) or withdrawals (Roth accounts) are tax-free, but not both. In the worst case where you do not have sufficient medical expenses to later withdraw tax-free, withdrawals after age 65 are taxable but penalty-free, so the account behaves similarly to a pre-tax retirement account ([[traditional IRA]], [[401(k)]], and others). 

In addition, HSA contributions via employer [[Payroll_-_cafeteria_plan_deductions#Health_Savings_Account|payroll deduction]] are exempt from [[Payroll_-_FICA_tax_deductions|FICA taxes]], where 401(k) and IRA contributions are not,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.voya.com/voya-insights/undervalued-benefit-hsa-programs-employers-and-employees-may-be-missing-fica-savings|title=The undervalued benefit of HSA programs employers and employees may be missing: FICA savings|publisher=Voya Financial|accessdate=June 26, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc424.html|title=Topic 424 - 401(k) Plans|publisher=IRS|accessdate=June 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this is usually a benefit. Higher-income investors above the second Social Security bend point should expect a [[Social_Security_as_an_investment#Rate_of_return|low or negative rate of return]] on Social Security taxes, so avoiding these taxes is a big benefit. Investors between the first and second bend-points can expect a modest return, and the benefit of avoiding Social Security taxes is not clear. Those below the first bend-point can expect an excellent return on Social Security taxes and should not avoid them. But, you can choose to pay FICA taxes on HSA contributions by contributing directly to the custodian, rather than via employer payroll deduction. 

You will also see a benefit in avoiding payroll tax if it will not affect your future Social Security benefits, such as when:

*You will not accrue 40 work credits (equivalent to ten years) necessary to qualify for Social Security benefits
*The current year will not be one of your top 35 earning years (adjusted for inflation)
*You expect to collect Social Security benefits based on someone else's earnings record
*Your earned income this year will be higher than the Social Security Wage Base ($168,600 as of 2024), which saves Medicare taxes only

See [[Social Security as an investment]] for more details.

===During working years===

During your working years, the choice of withdrawing from an HSA to pay for medical expenses, or paying them out-of-pocket, comes down to what you would otherwise do with the money. If withdrawing from the HSA means you can contribute more money into retirement accounts, that is the better choice. If you can afford to pay out-of-pocket for the medical expenses and would otherwise invest the money in a [[taxable account]], it is probably better to pay out-of-pocket, although there are exceptions.

====Maxing out retirement accounts====

If you are maxing out your retirement accounts, you should probably pay for current medical expenses out-of-pocket and leave the money in the HSA. This strategy treats the HSA as an opportunity for further retirement savings, like an IRA, with the plan to not withdraw from it until you retire. If you have $1,000 in medical bills, paying them out-of-pocket leaves the $1,000 in the HSA to grow tax-deferred or tax-free, and keeps the right to withdraw $1,000 tax-free in a future year (if you save records appropriately). If you pay the expense from the HSA, you will have an extra $1,000 to invest in your [[taxable account]], which will grow more slowly due to [[Taxable_account#Taxable_account_investing_strategy|tax drag]].

The biggest advantage of leaving the money in the HSA comes from the possibility that medical expenses will allow the ''growth'' on the money to also be tax-free. This can happen due to future medical expenses (including [[Medicare]] premiums), or if you have so many other past medical expenses that the HSA balance is unlikely to ever exceed them. In this case, future growth and withdrawals will be tax-free, similar to a Roth account. 

However, if you expect your HSA balance to be so large (and/or your medical expenses to be so small) that you will have to take taxable withdrawals, there may be better strategies. See: [[#Overfunded_HSA|Overfunded HSA]] below.

====Not maxing retirement accounts====

If you are not maxing out your retirement accounts, you should pay current expenses from the HSA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Forum post|t=150572|title=Confused by Wiki Advice on HSA Spending|date=10 Nov 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; If you are in a 24% tax bracket and have $1,000 in medical bills, taking $1,000 from the HSA to pay the bill means you can invest an extra $1,000 in your [[Roth IRA]] or $1,316 in your [[401(k)]], either of which will be as good or better than leaving it in the HSA.

If you keep the $1,000 in the HSA and pay the expense out-of-pocket, you will have the right to withdraw $1,000 tax-free from the HSA later, but the growth on the $1,000 might be tax-free or taxable depending on your medical expenses. The right to withdraw the $1,000 tax-free could even be lost if you leave the HSA to a non-spouse, or if you lose the receipts. But if you pay the expense out of the HSA and invest the $1,000 in a Roth IRA, your future gains will always be tax-free to you and your heirs, and your heirs get an additional [[Stretch IRA|ten-year stretch]]. If you invested $1,316 in a 401(k), that is just as good after adjusting for the presumed 24% tax you will pay in retirement.

===Withdrawing in retirement===
{{Main|Retirement draw-down priority}}

After you retire, you can withdraw from the HSA an amount equal to your past medical expenses plus any current expenses tax-free, and withdraw from your other accounts for non-medical expenses. HSAs can be used to pay medicare premiums and other medical expenses in retirement. If you are too healthy in retirement and cannot use the HSA for medical expenses (even past ones), the non-medical portion is still as good as a [[traditional IRA]] once you are age 65.

====Tax-free withdrawals====

If you need cash for spending and are choosing between withdrawals from an HSA and a Roth account, withdraw from the HSA tax-free (based on past and current medical expenses) before withdrawing from Roth accounts. Withdrawing tax-free from an HSA will almost always be better, and never worse, than withdrawing from a Roth account,&lt;ref&gt;{{Forum post|p=1973176|title=HSA as stealth IRA - Inheritance issue|date=25 Feb 2014|quote=Those with both Roth IRA accounts and HSA accounts with unreimbursed qualified medical expenses, should distribute those tax-free HSA dollars before touching the Roth accounts. Also, upon turning 65 they should make distributions for Medicare Part B premiums, and other qualified medical expenses (co-pay, co-insurance, dental, vision. etc...). Tax-free HSA dollars should always be spent before Roth dollars.}}&lt;/ref&gt; because: 

#Foregone future growth on the HSA money may or may not be tax-free, whereas growth on the Roth money will always be tax-free (as long as you meet the basic [[Roth_IRA#Treatment_of_distributions|distribution requirements]]) with the additional benefit of a [[Stretch_IRA|ten-year stretch]].
#It is possible that the HSA money might later become taxable if you wait to withdraw (if receipts get lost, someone forgets to make a qualified withdrawal, or the account is [[Health_savings_account#Non-spouse_beneficiary|left to a non-spouse]]).
#It eliminates the need to keep receipts for those expenses going forward (once the normal [[Record_retention#How_long_to_keep_records|retention period]] for tax records has passed), along with the risk they could get lost, destroyed, have ink fade, and so on.  

If you need cash for spending and are choosing between withdrawals from an HSA and a pre-tax traditional account, consider instead the combination of tax-free HSA withdrawal and a [[Roth conversion]]. This has the same tax impact as a pre-tax withdrawal, but shifts money from an HSA to a Roth account, which is desirable for the above reasons. Therefore, you should always withdraw tax-free from an HSA before retirement accounts.

In some cases, it can make sense to withdraw tax-free from an HSA as a tax-planning maneuver even if you do not need the money for spending, and reinvest it in a [[taxable account]]. Examples include when:

*You think there is a chance the money will not be later withdrawn tax-free, because the receipts might get lost, you or your surviving spouse might forget, or you plan to leave the money to a non-spouse and could die suddenly.
*You might have an [[#Overfunded_HSA|overfunded HSA]]. Although the dollars in the taxable account will grow more slowly, the lower tax rates on long-term capital gains and the [[step-up in basis]] should more than compensate for [[stock]]-like investments. See [[#Overfunded_HSA|below]] for more details.

As you reach later retirement, the benefit of continuing to leave money in the HSA decreases (there are fewer years of potential tax-advantaged growth) and the risk of losing the right to withdraw tax-free increases. How long you want to push it is a personal decision, but there will be a point when the benefits no longer outweigh the risks, unless you have named a charitable organization to inherit your HSA.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Handling HSAs After Death or Divorce | author1 = Helen Modly|author2 = Tommie Monez| work = Morningstar| date = October 22, 2016 | accessdate = Jan 22, 2019| url = https://www.morningstar.com/articles/774640/handling-hsas-after-death-or-divorce.html| url-access=subscription | language = en-us | quote=There is a good case for allowing the HSA balances to grow as a cushion for high medical expenses later in life, but consideration should also be given to the inheritance tax disadvantage. Eventually using up the tax-free dollars for medical expenses or naming a charity as beneficiary can mitigate or eliminate the tax consequences.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In mid- to late-retirement, withdrawing the HSA roughly evenly over your life expectancy could be a reasonable compromise.

====Taxable withdrawals====

Taxable withdrawals from an HSA usually do not make sense when other sources of funding are available, because possible future medical expenses would allow future tax-free withdrawals. If you have current or past medical expenses for which you have saved receipts, and can therefore take a tax-free withdrawal, it is almost always better to do so rather than take a taxable withdrawal. Taxable HSA withdrawals can provide a source of funding when other assets have been exhausted. Taxable withdrawals can also be beneficial for tax-planning when you have an overfunded HSA; see [[#Overfunded_HSA|below]].

===How to invest the HSA===

If you are paying current expenses out of pocket, the HSA is intended for medical expenses in retirement. You should therefore invest it as if part of your IRA or 401(k), as those accounts are also invested for retirement expenses. If you are using the HSA for current expenses, consider at least one year's deductible as part of your [[emergency fund]], because it is likely you will need this amount for medical bills; you can invest the remainder as if part of an IRA or 401(k).

If you view the HSA as part of your overall retirement portfolio, you can then choose which assets from your [[asset allocation]] to hold in your HSA, and which to hold elsewhere. If you live in a state that does not recognize HSAs, state taxes give a strong incentive to hold Treasury bonds or TIPS there. In the other states, HSAs are similar to Roth accounts in terms of the principles of [[Tax-efficient_fund_placement#Step_4:_Place_high_growth_stock_funds|tax-efficient fund placement for tax free accounts]]. If you have an [[#Overfunded_HSA|overfunded HSA]], it will behave less like a Roth account and more like a traditional IRA (or even a [[Non-deductible traditional IRA|non-deductible IRA]]) for asset location purposes, and it could make sense to shift your HSA to contain bonds rather than stocks. 

==Overfunded HSA==

An ''overfunded HSA'' is one where the balance exceeds, or is likely to exceed, available qualified medical expenses over your and your spouse's lifetime.

While this can happen, many retirees underestimate their healthcare expenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://moneywise.com/retirement/retirement/nearly-50-of-american-retirees-underestimated-their-healthcare-costs-and-how-far-medicare-would-stretch|title=Nearly 50% of American retirees underestimated their healthcare costs — and how far Medicare would stretch. 3 simple ways to protect yourself|publisher=MoneyWise|accessdate=July 18, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt; High savers may find themselves in higher [[Income-Related Monthly Adjustment Amount (IRMAA)|IRMAA]] tiers, leading to additional qualified medical expenses because Medicare premiums (including IRMAA) are qualified medical expenses for an HSA.

An overfunded HSA may also be intentional, because a high earner planning a lower cost retirement may enjoy the similarity to a traditional deductible IRA and be happy to save a high marginal rate and then pay a lower marginal rate when withdrawing after age 65.

Overfunded HSAs usually result from leaving money invested inside the HSA over long periods of time, where the balance can compound fully tax-deferred; medical expenses do not compound even if they accrue annually. 

===Cautions===

If you are younger and your future medical expenses are very uncertain, it is probably best to leave money in the HSA as long as possible, to prepare for the more likely case that your future medical expenses will let you eventually withdraw the entire HSA balance tax-free.  

Withdrawals for non-medical expenses are taxable, and also have a 20% penalty if you are under age 65. Large HSA balances also increase the risk of leaving your heirs with a large spike of taxable income in a single year. The tax advantages of an HSA are much better when you are able to use it for qualified medical expenses and withdraw tax-free. 

Leaving money in the HSA also has the benefit of many decades of tax-deferred growth, which can [[Non-deductible_traditional_IRA#Performance|overcome]] higher tax rates that might come later on. Actions to mitigate an overfunded HSA are best taken once you are closer to retirement or already in retirement, when you have much less uncertainty about the relative sizes of your HSA and medical expenses.

===Mitigations===

If you might unintentionally have an overfunded HSA, consider one or more of the following strategies to mitigate the tax impact:

*Pay for medical expenses out of the HSA even when you are [[#Maxing_out_retirement_accounts|maxing out your retirement accounts]].
*Withdraw tax-free from your HSA even if you do not need the money for spending, and reinvest the money in a [[taxable account]].
*Shift your [[Bond basics|bond]] allocation into the HSA and [[stock]] allocation into retirement accounts.
*During the accumulation phase, switch to a non-HSA-eligible medical plan (that is, a low-deductible plan) if those premiums are competitive.
*Choose Medicare supplement plans with smaller premiums but higher deductibles, which shifts non-HSA-eligible expenses to HSA-eligible expenses.
*Spread the HSA out over multiple [[Asset_titling_in_the_United_States#Beneficiary_designation|beneficiaries]].
*Name a charity or [[Donor advised fund|Donor Advised Fund (DAF)]] as the beneficiary of the HSA, if you were planning to leave some of your estate to charity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Forum post|t=256861|title=The problem with 'saving receipts' for future qualified HSA withdrawals|date=19 Aug 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If you expect to not live much longer and plan to leave an overfunded HSA to non-spouse heirs, taxable HSA withdrawals should be a higher priority than pre-tax retirement accounts. Unlike pre-tax accounts, HSAs do not get a [[Stretch IRA|ten-year stretch]], which means heirs do not get up to ten years of tax-protected growth, and if the balance is large on a per-heir basis, the large income in a single year can spike their tax rates more than if it were spread across ten years.

===Similarity to a non-deductible IRA===

The up-front tax deduction and potential for tax-free growth is what makes HSA ''contributions'' better than most other retirement account contributions when [[Prioritizing investments]], as noted [[#Contribution_priority_compared_to_other_accounts|above]]. Treating the HSA balance above qualified medical expenses as a [[traditional IRA]] (except without the ability to [[Roth_conversion|convert to Roth]]) is a reasonable perspective. You may also consider the decision of whether to ''leave money inside'' an overfunded HSA that you can now withdraw tax-free as similar to deciding whether to invest in a [[non-deductible traditional IRA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Forum post|t=434227|title=Proposed update to Health Savings Account wiki page|date=22 Jun 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt; If you make a tax-free withdrawal from an HSA, you can reinvest an equal number of dollars in a [[taxable account]]. Although the balance would grow with tax drag, future gains are taxed at lower long-term capital gains rates. If the HSA is overfunded, future growth within the HSA will be taxable at higher ordinary income rates. And importantly, a taxable account gets a [[step-up in basis]] at your death, whereas an HSA does not. The decision to withdraw tax-free also depends on which assets you plan to hold in your HSA; [[Stock|stocks]] tend to perform better when reinvested in a taxable account, while [[Bond basics|bonds]] tend to perform better inside an HSA. See: [[Non-deductible_traditional_IRA#Taxable_account|Comparison between a non-deductible traditional IRA and a taxable account]]. 

If you reduce your projected HSA balance so that you no longer expect it to exceed available medical expenses, the HSA will switch to behaving more like a Roth account (albeit one you should spend down over your lifetime). Further tax-free withdrawals would be trading future tax-free growth for [[Taxable account|taxable]] growth and so would probably not be beneficial. Balancing your HSA balance and expenses regularly as you move through retirement is a good strategy.

==Inherited HSA==
===Spouse beneficiary===

When an HSA holder dies, a surviving spouse who is a beneficiary may assume the HSA as their own, and so reimburse qualified medical expenses of the deceased spouse after assuming ownership of the HSA, free of taxes.&lt;ref name="irs._Publ"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p969.pdf|title=Publication 969, Health Savings Accounts and Other Tax-Favored Health Plans|publisher=IRS|accessdate=June 25, 2024|page=10|quote=Spouse is the designated beneficiary: If your spouse is the designated beneficiary of your HSA, it will be treated as your spouse’s HSA after your death.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Non-spouse beneficiary===

The rules for a non-spouse beneficiary, however, are more complicated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Forum post|t=133792|title=HSA as stealth IRA - Inheritence issue|date=25 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="theb_What"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Choosing Beneficiaries for Your Health or Medical Savings Account | first = Julie | last = Garber | work = The Balance | date = 6 March 2017 | accessdate = 2017-11-04 | url = https://www.thebalance.com/choosing-beneficiaries-for-your-hsa-msa-3505285 | language =  en-us | quote =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Forum post|t=141799|title=After death, is an HSA still an HSA?|date=25 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fair_Fair"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Fairmark Forum :: Retirement Savings and Benefits :: HSA non-spouse beneficiary | author = Spirit Rider | work = fairmark.com | date = 10 September 2013 | accessdate = 2017-11-04 | url = https://fairmark.com/forum/read.php?2,70839 | language = EN | quote =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Forum post|t=221783 | title=HSA beneficiary options (tax considerations) | date=23 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the HSA account-holder dies and does not leave the account to their spouse, the entire value of the HSA becomes taxable to the beneficiary in that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p969.pdf|title=Publication 969, Health Savings Accounts and Other Tax-Favored Health Plans|publisher=IRS|accessdate=June 25, 2024|page=10|quote=Spouse isn’t the designated beneficiary: If your spouse isn’t the designated beneficiary of your HSA, the account stops being an HSA, and the fair market value of the HSA becomes taxable to the beneficiary in the year in which you die.}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the beneficiary may pay the decedent's ''unpaid'' medical expenses, and reduce the taxable amount by the amount paid within 1 year after the date of death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p969.pdf|title=Publication 969, Health Savings Accounts and Other Tax-Favored Health Plans|publisher=IRS|accessdate=June 25, 2024|page=10|quote=The amount taxable to a beneficiary other than the estate is reduced by any qualified medical expenses for the decedent that are paid by the beneficiary within 1 year after the date of death.}}&lt;/ref&gt; If you leave the account to your estate, the value is included on your final income tax return.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p969.pdf|title=Publication 969, Health Savings Accounts and Other Tax-Favored Health Plans|publisher=IRS|accessdate=June 25, 2024|page=10|quote=If your estate is the beneficiary, the value is included on your final income tax return.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike an [[Stretch IRA|inherited IRA]] or [[401(k)]], an HSA inherited by a non-spouse ceases to be a tax-advantaged account, and qualified medical expenses incurred by the decedent can no longer be reimbursed tax-free. As a result, from an estate planning perspective, an HSA has no more value to a non-spouse, non-charitable beneficiary than an equal amount of taxable income, and much less value than an equal amount of cash. For this reason, you should plan to spend down your HSA roughly over your lifetime, and not wait until you are too old to withdraw for past medical expenses. See [[#How_to_use_the_plan/Withdrawing_in_retirement|Withdrawing in retirement]] for strategies on how to mitigate the HSA's estate planning characteristics, and [[#Overfunded_HSA|Overfunded HSA]] for strategies to deal with an HSA that is larger than available qualified medical expenses.

==Advantages==

HSAs are unique among investment accounts in that they can be fully tax-free (contribution, growth, and withdrawal) when used for qualified medical expenses. As most investors will have substantial medical expenses over their lifetime, HSAs provide an opportunity for substantial tax savings compared to using other accounts. Many HSAs are available with great low-cost investment options consistent with [[Bogleheads®_investment_philosophy|Bogleheads®-style investing]]. 

As with a [[Flexible spending arrangement|flexible spending account]], an HSA allows you to contribute tax-deductible dollars and spend them tax-free on medical costs. However, money in a flexible spending account is lost if not used within a grace period after the end of the year, so you can only use it for expected expenses and will pay unexpected medical expenses with after-tax dollars. The HSA allows you to pay all your expenses with pre-tax dollars as long as they fit within the HSA limit, and what is not used continues to roll over to following years.

==Disadvantages==

The main potential disadvantage of the HSA is not the account itself, but the [[High deductible health plan|high-deductible plan]] that goes with it. If you have very low expenses, the high deductible does not matter; if you have very high medical costs, the plan must have a catastrophic maximum out-of-pocket cost which may also save you money. If your expenses are near the deductible, you may be better off without the HSA, using a conventional plan instead. HSAs are not available from all major fund companies, and often have maintenance fees, but there are some good ones in the [[Health_savings_account#HSA_custodians_and_options |HSA custodians and options]] section just below.

As an account, the main disadvantage of HSAs is their poor estate planning characteristics. When left to a non-spouse, the right to withdraw for past medical expenses of the owner is lost, and the entire balance becomes taxable in a single year (although leaving the HSA to a charitable organization eliminates any tax). These characteristics drive the [[#How_to_use_the_plan|strategies]] on how to best use an HSA. See [[Health_savings_account#Inherited HSA|Inherited HSA]] for details.

An HSA may be challenging for someone without a sufficient emergency fund; see [[Prioritizing investments]]. In contrast to an [[Flexible_spending_arrangement#Distributions_from_an_FSA|FSA]] where the entire amount may be available on January 1 each year, funds for an HSA are not available until they are deducted from your paycheck over the course of the year. 

To maximize the tax benefits of the HSA, you may need to store medical receipts for many years or decades before requesting reimbursement. This creates extra work, with the risk that records could be lost, degraded, or destroyed. Filing for reimbursement in the distant future is more difficult than seamless immediate reimbursement when an insurance company directly bills the HSA provider.

You can contribute to an HSA without any earned income.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kiplinger.com/article/insurance/t027-c001-s003-you-don-t-need-earnings-to-contribute-to-an-hsa.html|title=You Don’t Need Earnings to Contribute to a Health Savings Account|publisher=Kiplinger|date=February 23, 2016|accessdate=July 25, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;||Deducting traditional IRA contributions has a low [[Traditional_IRA#Contribution_and_income_limits|income limit]] when you are covered by a retirement plan at work. The limit is higher for spouses not covered, and there is no limit if the single filer or both MFJ filers are not covered. Roth IRA contributions have a higher [[Roth_IRA#Contribution_eligibility_and_limits|income limit]], but this limit can be circumvented by the [[Backdoor Roth|Backdoor Roth IRA process]]. No income limits for employer plans. Contributions must be from earned income, but it is possible to contribute to both a Roth 401k and an IRA based off the same earned income.&lt;ref&gt;{{Forum post|t= 338323|title=Double dip in Solo Roth 401(k) and Roth IRA?|date=January 30, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;||HSAs have an advantage over IRAs for investors looking for deductible savings beyond employer plans, and in years where you have no earned income.
|-
! Tax structure
|HSAs are “triple tax-free” when used for qualified medical expenses: contributions are deductible, growth is tax-protected, and qualified withdrawals are tax-free. Non-qualified withdrawals after age 65 are penalty-free but taxable, so the account behaves like a pre-tax retirement account in this case.||Deductible retirement account contributions are taxable when withdrawn. Roth contributions are taxable when made but tax-free with withdrawn. [[Non-deductible traditional IRA|Non-deductible IRAs]] are a special case.||HSAs are fully tax-free in the most common case where sufficient medical expenses are available. In the worst case when they are not, the HSA behaves like a pre-tax retirement account. For this reason, HSAs will be as good or better than retirement accounts for taxes, and investors should usually [[#Contribution_priority_compared_to_other_accounts|contribute to an HSA first]].
|-
! [[State income taxes|State taxes]]
|HSA contributions are tax-deductible in all income-taxing states except for California and New Jersey.||Massachusetts does not allow deductions for [[traditional IRA]] contributions, but they do for all other pre-tax retirement accounts (401k, 403b, etc.). New Jersey does not allow deductions for contributions to retirement accounts ''except'' for a pre-tax 401k. Pennsylvania does not allow any retirement account deductions, but does not tax retirement withdrawals, so they behave like Roth accounts for state tax purposes. Alabama, Colorado, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, and New York exclude some federally-taxable retirement withdrawals from taxation. Illinois, Iowa, and Mississippi do not tax any distributions from retirement accounts, but allow deductions for pre-tax contributions. Georgia has a large exemption for all income in retirement, making retirement withdrawals tax-free for many retirees. Other income-taxing states follow federal tax rules for retirement accounts.||Investors in California or New Jersey will probably still come out ahead using an HSA for medical expenses compared to a retirement account.
|-
! [[Payroll - FICA tax deductions|Payroll taxes]]
|HSA contributions made through an [[Payroll - cafeteria plan deductions|employer payroll deduction]] are payroll tax-deductible. Contributions made directly to a HSA custodian are not.||Retirement plan contributions are not payroll tax-deductible, except for employer contributions to an employer plan.||Investors above the second Social Security [[Social Security as an investment|bend point]] and/or above the Social Security Wage Base will see an advantage with the payroll tax deduction. Investors who do not want to avoid payroll tax can contribute directly to the HSA custodian. HSAs have the advantage.
|-
! Employer contributions and matching
|Employers will sometimes contribute a fixed amount into employees’ HSAs, but usually not based on matching calculations. ||Employers will sometimes offer a [[Employer matching contributions|match]] for employer plan contributions. IRAs do not get a match. ||Employer plan, if matching is offered. Getting an employer match should be a top [[Prioritizing investments|financial priority]].
|-
! Investment choices
|HSAs only allow a set of investments offered by the plan, which may be limited.||Employer plans only allow a set of investments offered by the plan, which may be undesirable. Some plans have a [[Self directed brokerage account|brokerage option]] allowing trading of stocks and ETFs, and occasionally a plan will have unusual investments (a [[Stable value fund|stable value fund]], annuities, real estate funds, etc.) that could be uniquely valuable to certain investors. IRAs offer a wide variety of investments. Self-directed retirement accounts offer an even wider range of investments.||Plan-dependent. IRAs usually have an advantage over employer plans and HSAs. But, there are plenty of HSAs and employer plans with sufficient variety of good investments to build a portfolio.
|-
! Fees
|Most HSAs have modest fees in the 0.3%/year range, and may also require a certain balance to be kept in cash rather than invested. Investors can choose their own HSA custodian, and at least one offers fee-free HSAs ([[#Fidelity|Fidelity]]), but if it is not the custodian chosen by your employer, you will lose the payroll tax deduction by contributing directly.||Employer plans can have high fees (~1-2%+ per year), but plan fees have come down on average in recent decades, and many have no fees except those within the offered mutual funds. Most IRA custodians offer fee-free IRAs.||Depends on the plan. HSAs tend to have higher fees than IRAs and good workplace plans, but are usually better than bad workplace plans. You can choose a fee-free HSA custodian (like [[#Fidelity|Fidelity]]), but if you contribute through an employer, you will have to periodically roll over money into your preferred custodian.
|-
! Compatibility with [[Backdoor Roth|Backdoor Roth IRA]]
|HSA balances do not interfere with the Backdoor Roth IRA.||Pre-tax traditional (along with SEP and SIMPLE) IRA balances ''do'' interfere with the Backdoor Roth IRA, but workplace plan balances do not.||HSAs have an advantage over deductible traditional IRAs. 
|-
! Early distribution options
| Tax- and penalty-free withdrawals are always allowed for current medical expenses, and past medical expenses that accrued after the HSA was established and for which you have saved the receipts. Otherwise, nonqualified HSA withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income and also charged a 20% penalty. The penalty is waived after age 65.||Withdrawals before age 59½ are charged a 10% penalty, with the following exceptions: disability, [[Substantially equal periodic payments|SEPP]], IRS levy, medical expenses, separation from service age 55 or older, and others. Plans may offer loans, hardship withdrawals, and/or in-service withdrawals, but whether these withdrawals incur penalties is subject to IRS rules. [[Roth IRA]] contributions can always be withdrawn tax- and penalty-free. Otherwise, early withdrawals are taxable and charged a 10% penalty.||Early HSA early withdrawals are more heavily penalized by paying twice the penalty rate, paying taxes that might otherwise not need to be paid, and the higher age limit. However, in practice most HSA owners will have plenty of medical expenses that can be used for qualified withdrawals, and those with [[#Overfunded_HSA|overfunded HSAs]] probably have other sources of funds, so this is not usually a serious disadvantage. 
|-
! [[Record retention]]
|When using an HSA as an investment account and leaving money in the account for tax-advantaged growth, you will need to save records for all medical expenses you incurred after the HSA was established. Storing and preserving these records over potentially many decades is not a trivial effort. ||Retirement accounts generally require minimal record retention. [[Roth IRA]] owners should keep a record of when the account was first established, contributions, and any [[Roth conversion|Roth conversions]], to avoid unnecessary taxes and penalties on [[Roth_IRA#Distributions|distributions]]. [[Traditional IRA]] owners making [[Non-deductible traditional IRA|non-deductible]] contributions need to keep track of their basis.||In order to realize the main tax benefits of an HSA, you may need to carefully keep records over long periods of time. If you are not confident you will be able to keep records, you should likely contribute to retirement accounts first. 
|-
! [[Asset protection|Asset protection]]&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Asset protection is a complex legal subject that is further complicated due to many laws being state-specific. The information presented here is only high-level, and as noted on the [[Asset protection|wiki page]], legal ambiguity exists in some areas. For asset protection legal advice, consult a competent asset protection attorney in your state.&lt;/ref&gt;
| HSAs do not receive federal protection from bankruptcy or creditors. Some states protect HSAs from bankruptcy and creditors but most do not.||ERISA 401(k) and 403(b) plans are protected from civil judgments and bankruptcy at the federal level. IRAs receive state-level protection from civil judgments, which [https://www.thetaxadviser.com/content/dam/tta/issues/2014/jan/stateirachart.pdf varies widely by state]. Traditional and Roth IRAs are exempt from federal bankruptcy up to $1.0M, and SEP and SIMPLE IRAs receive unlimited exemption.||HSAs are worse than ERISA employer plans. HSAs also tend to be worse than IRAs, but it is more state-dependent.
|-
! [[Required Minimum Distribution|Required Minimum Distributions]]
|HSAs have no Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs). ||Pre-tax retirement accounts have Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs) that start at age 73, except that employer plans (other than a Solo 401k) waive RMDs while you are still working. Roth accounts have no RMDs. || While HSAs do not have RMDs like pre-tax accounts, in practice due to the poor estate planning behavior of HSAs, you are usually best-off spending your HSA over your lifetime so the lack of RMDs is not much of an advantage.
|-
! Inheritance
| Spouses can [[#Spouse_beneficiary|inherit an HSA]] and treat it as their own, and can withdraw tax-free based on their own medical expenses and those of their deceased spouse for which they have receipts. If [[#Non-spouse_beneficiary|left to a non-spouse]], the entire HSA becomes taxable income in a single year, and the right to withdraw tax-free based on any past medical expenses is lost.||Spouses are generally allowed to treat inherited retirement accounts as their own. When left to a non-spouse, heirs must withdraw the account balance by the [[Stretch IRA|end of the tenth year]] after the owner’s death.||HSAs have far worse inheritance behavior than retirement accounts, because of the loss of right to withdraw tax-free for any of the owner’s medical expenses, and the concentrated taxable income in a single year. The poor inheritance behavior of HSAs drives the strategy for [[#How_to_use_the_plan|how they are best used]].

==HSA custodians and options==
This list is not complete; please add others. Custodians are listed in alphabetical order.

===Alliant Credit Union (HealthEquity)===
[https://www.alliantcreditunion.org/depositsinvestments/healthsavings/ Alliant Credit Union] has no fees to open the account, no monthly or management fees, no transaction fees, free checks, free VISA debit card, no minimums, no fees to close the account. Alliant is ideal for a "cash" HSA to pay ongoing medical expenses or a starter HSA while you build towards an "investment" HSA.  The HSA can be invested for a $5.95 monthly fee, with at least $1000 remaining in the cash account.  Options include several Vanguard funds.

Note: Starting October 5, 2017, Alliant's HSA will be transitioned to HealthEquity. See this {{Forum post|t=227963|title=Alliant Credit Union no longer offering HSAs as of 11/9}} and [https://www.healthequity.com/alliant/members/ Alliant HSAs now administered by HealthEquity].

===BenefitWallet===

As of April 2024, BenefitWallet HSAs have been transitioned to [[#Health_Equity|HealthEquity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www2.healthequity.com/benefitwallet2/members/|title=Welcome to HealthEquity|publisher=HealthEquity|accessdate=July 7, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Discovery Benefits (WEX) ===

The Discovery Benefits (Wex) HSA is only offered through employer plans.

Terms and fees may vary from one company to another, so be sure to verify this information for your own employer. To view the fee schedule, log in to your account, then click the "Get Help" link which takes you into a help site. From there, in the search function search for "fee". You should see a search result for "Article ID: PROD-2175 | Health Savings Account (HSA) custodial management fee FAQ" which explains the general fees.

For at least one Discovery Benefits HSA member, the "The custodial management fee is a flat fee of 25 basis points per year that is assessed quarterly. This equates to 0.0625% each quarter on any dollars currently invested in mutual funds... The HealthcareBank interest-bearing account is excluded from this fee." There are no low-balance fees in the savings account, or other fees. As noted, the fee schedule may vary from one company to another, depending on the terms negotiated between each company and Discovery Benefits.

If your HSA balance is low, then the fees are lower than many employer-based HSAs that charge a flat monthly fee. But since the fee is assessed as a percentage on your balance, then the higher your balance, the greater your fees. For this reason, if you wish to avoid these fees, it would be advisable to perform an annual HSA transfer or rollover to a no-fee HSA.

==== Discovery Benefits Investment Platform ====

The investing platform is available for any HSA balance over $1,000. You can set up automated investing so that any balance over the minimum is automatically invested. The platform contains multiple Vanguard index funds in the institutional share class, as well as Target Retirement date funds.

==Planning Social Security benefits==

Under the rules of Social Security, your Primary Insurance Amount (PIA) is defined as the benefit you receive in the month of your Full Retirement Age (FRA).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/COLA/piaformula.html Primary Insurance Amount], from the Social Security Administration.&lt;/ref&gt; If you claim benefits earlier or later than your Full Retirement Age, the amount you will receive will be lower or higher than the Primary Insurance Amount.

Therefore, the amount of the benefit you receive is based on calculations determined by:

* Your Primary Insurance Amount at Full Retirement Age
* Claiming Social Security earlier or later than your Full Retirement Age
** Benefits will be lower if claimed earlier
** Benefits will be higher if claimed later

For each month that you begin before your FRA, you reduce your benefit by 5/9 of 1%. For example, if your FRA is 66, you reach this age on December 9, and you elect to begin your benefit on June 9, the reduction to your benefit would be 6 × 5/9 × 1% = 3.33%. This monthly reduction rate occurs for the first 36 months that you begin prior to your FRA. After 36 months, it is 5/12 of 1% per month. The only other factors that would change the 5/9 of 1% reduction would be if the individual has earned income in the previous year, as the PIA will not include this, and the annual inflation adjuster for the new year.  

If you delay starting your retirement or old-age benefit past FRA, you earn Delayed Retirement Credits and get a larger benefit.  Wife, husband, widow, and widower benefits are also reduced if started before FRA (using different formulas), but are not increased by waiting past FRA to start.

{{Notice| The Social Security Administration has an illustrative table which shows the effects of early or late retirement. See: [{{{url|http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/ProgData/ar_drc.html}}} Early or delayed retirement].

For example, you were born in 1951. If you decided to retire at 66 (your full retirement age), you would get 100% of your retirement benefits.

If you decided to retire early at 63, you would get 80% of your benefits.

Delaying retirement beyond the age of 66 will increase your benefit by 8% of your Primary Insurance Amount / year. Waiting one year (until 67), results in receiving a benefit of 108%, which is 8% more than if you had taken retirement at 66. Waiting until 68 results in a benefit of 116%, which is 7.4% more than if you had started at 67.}}

Social Security is unisex and roughly actuarially fair. If you are a single unisex person of average health, it doesn't matter when you take it. There is a rough trade-off between fewer dollars for more years (start early) and more dollars for fewer years (start late). 

Since females outlive males on average, single males will live fewer years than a unisex person and should take it earlier; single females will live more years than a unisex person and should take it later. 

Since widows and widowers get the greater of their own benefit and their deceased spouse's benefit,&lt;ref group="note"&gt;A surviving spouse or child may receive a special lump-sum death payment of $255 if they meet certain requirements. Apply within two years of the date of death. See: [http://www.ssa.gov/survivorplan/ifyou7.htm Survivors Planner: A Special Lump-Sum Death Payment]&lt;/ref&gt; married couples have to consider their joint life. A high earning male with a low earning wife should wait to collect the higher benefit, not because he will live long enough to make up for what he gives up by not starting early, but because his wife will. 

All benefits are subject to the earnings test if you are under Full Retirement Age.  Your benefits will be reduced depending on your earnings for the year.  Your wife (husband) may also have her wife (his husband) benefits that are based on your work record reduced by your earnings.  The earnings test does not apply once you reach Full Retirement Age.

Here is a concrete question from the forums that shows the potential complexity of Social Security planning, which may not be fully applicable anymore to those who turn 62 after Jan 2, 2016 due to the new deemed filing rules: 

{{quotation|
Wife and I are same age, 62 this summer. Her SS that she qualifies for on her own is about half mine. The wrinkle is she still is working. Her 35 highest years have a lot of zeros, so each year she works will replace a zero. I am retired and when I turn 62 my pension drops by more than half, called a level income option because it assume SS will be started at 62. We need to make up some of the income lost by the drop in pension. Wife contributes 1000 per month to her 401(k) so we can stop that. Having her file for SS as the link suggests might be an option but she plans to work to age 66. Her salary is very modest but her job provides us health benefits. Do you think this "Team Play" technique would work for us or does it assume both spouses are not working?}}

The full answer: 

{{quotation|
The Team Play described assumes neither is working at 62, and turned 62 before January 2, 2016. There are several issues for you to consider. 

Her own benefits: 
If your wife is going to continue to work for the health benefits, then it doesn't make sense for her to apply for her own benefits before age 66 if she makes much more than $20,000. The earnings limit for 2009 is $14,160 - for every $2 over the limit, $1 is withheld from benefits. If her benefit at age 62 would be $800 a month ($9,600 a year), she would get to keep none of her social security if she makes $33,360 ($19,200 over the limit - benefits reduced by $9,600). 

Spousal benefits: 
When you reach 66, you can either file or file and suspend (''File and suspend is not of benefit under the new tax law''). Your wife can then apply for wife's benefits on your record. At 66, she will get half of your PIA (age 66 benefit) if her own PIA is a lesser amount. If your PIA is $1,800 a month and hers is $800, she can get $900 as a wife. If hers is $1,000, she won't get a wife's benefit, but she will get her own $1,000 (this assumes that she starts benefits at 66 - it is possible for her to delay her own benefits while collecting spousal benefits). Since she is still working and replacing some of those zero years, she may well end up with a PIA greater than 1/2 of yours (in spite of your statement that her benefit is about 1/2 of yours, that may not be true after her additional earnings are included in her calculation). You however, could follow part of the team play plan. When your wife applies for her own benefits at age 66, you can apply for your husband's benefit while delaying your own benefit. If her benefit is $800, you could get $400 at age 66 as her husband. By not taking your $1,800 at 66, you will increase the amount you eventually get at 70 (assuming you delay the maximum).}}

==Some basic rules about eligibility==
*If you apply for your own benefit before your Full Retirement Age and you are eligible for a spousal benefit at that time, you are presumed or deemed to have applied for a wife or husband's benefit at the same time.&lt;ref group="note" name="ObliviousInvestor"&gt;Exception: If you are younger than 62 as of 1 Jan 2016, deemed filing can occur beyond full retirement age as well. Specifically, if you apply for retirement benefits at any time and you are also eligible at that time for a spousal benefit, you will be deemed to have filed for your spousal benefit as well. In addition, if you are entitled to your retirement benefit at any time and you later become eligible for a spousal benefit, you will be deemed to have filed for your spousal benefit when you become eligible. (Ref: [https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=2700523#p2700523 Re: Changes to Social Security], [[Mike Piper]], Nov 27, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;
*If you apply for a wife or husband's benefit before your Full Retirement Age and you are eligible for a spousal benefit at that time, you are presumed or deemed to have applied for your own benefit at the same time.&lt;ref group="note" name="ObliviousInvestor" /&gt;
*You are ''entitled'' to a benefit if you are ''eligible'' and apply.
*You can suspend your old-age (retirement) benefit and earn Delayed Retirement Credits if you are Full Retirement Age.
*If you suspend your old-age benefit, you remain entitled to it even if no payments are made.
*You are eligible for a wife or husband's benefit if your spouse is entitled to old-age or disability benefits and&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Exception: If your spouse has suspended his/her retirement benefit, and the suspension request was made after 29 Apr 2016, you will not be eligible for a spousal benefit during the period of suspension. (Ref: [https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=2700121#p2700121 Re: Changes to Social Security], [[Mike Piper]], Nov 26, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;
#You have been married for a year (or other special cases),
#You are 62 or have in care a child under 16 receiving child's benefits (or a qualifying disabled adult child receiving [[Planning for disabled adult children#Social Security Disability Income - Disabled Adult Child (SSDI-DAC)|SSDI-DAC benefits)]] based on your spouse's record,
#You are not entitled to an old-age or disability benefit based on a primary insurance amount that is equal to 1/2 or more of your spouse's.
*You can withdraw your application within 12 months of your original entitlement:
#You must pay back all benefits receive by you or your family that depend on the application.
#You must get the consent of anyone receiving benefits based on the application; for example, your spouse.
#You can only withdraw one application in your lifetime.

==Some additional notes and examples on spouse benefit==
(''Additional strategies to increase benefits may be available for those who turned 62 before Jan 2, 2016'')
*Self benefits are those benefits based on your own work record.
*Spouse benefits are those benefits based on your spouse’s work record.
*Self and spouse benefits are separate and the calculations are applied to each separately.
*Your available benefit is the combination of your own benefit and your spouse benefit.
*The benefit calculations are based on the PIA (Primary Insurance Amount), FRA (Full Retirement Age) and the number of months before or after FRA that self and spouse begin receiving benefits.
*Any benefit increase or decrease (in percentage terms) due to taking, or deemed to be taking, a self or spouse benefit earlier or later than FRA, is permanent.
*A spouse benefit is only available if one spouse’s PIA is less than half of the other spouse’s PIA. The spouse benefit (SB) is the difference between half of the higher earning spouse’s PIA (PIA1) and the lower earning spouse’s PIA (PIA2), that is SB = Max(0, PIA1 / 2 &amp;minus; PIA2)
*You cannot take your own benefit or your spouse benefit before age 62.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;An exception is the spousal child in care benefit, for a child or a disabled adult child, in which the spouse may receive spousal child in care benefits prior to 62 years old.

[https://www.ssa.gov/oact/quickcalc/spouse.html Social Security - Benefits for Spouses]

&lt;/ref&gt;
*You cannot take your spouse benefit unless your spouse is taking their own benefit.
*You are deemed to have taken your spouse benefit if you and your spouse are taking your own benefits, even if you have not formally applied for the spouse benefit and are not, in fact, even receiving the spouse benefit. 
*If you are taking a spouse benefit, you are deemed to be taking your own benefit. 
*If you take, or are deemed to take, your own benefit at your FRA, you will receive an amount equal to your PIA. 
*If you take, or are deemed to take, your own benefit before your FRA, your benefit is reduced by 5/9% per month for each of the first 36 months and 5/12% per month for each month beyond 36 months that you choose to receive your benefit before FRA.
*If you take, or are deemed to take, your own benefit after your FRA, your benefit is increased by 2/3% per month for each month after FRA that you choose to receive your benefit, up to, but not including, age 70.
*If you take, or are deemed to take, your spouse benefit at your FRA, you will receive your full spouse benefit.
*If you take, or are deemed to take, your spouse benefit before your FRA, your spouse benefit is reduced by 25/36% per month for each of the first 36 months and 5/12% per month for each month beyond 36 months that you choose to receive your spouse benefit before FRA.
*If you take your spouse benefit after your FRA, there is no change to the benefit.

===Examples===
'''Situation'''
*Husband's PIA: $3,000
*Wife's PIA: $1,000
*Wife's FRA: 67
*Husband’s FRA: 67 (note that the wife’s spouse benefit does not depend on when the husband takes his benefit in relation to his FRA, but does in relation to her FRA)

Wife’s full spouse benefit is ($3,000 / 2 &amp;minus; $1,000) = $500

'''Case 1''' (wife takes at 62, husband already taking)
Her own reduced benefit is:
*5/9% &amp;times; 36 = 20%
*5/12% &amp;times; 24 = 10%
*Total early claim deduction for her own benefit = 30%
*(100 &amp;minus; 30)% &amp;times; $1,000 = $700

Her reduced spouse benefit is:
*25/36% &amp;times; 36 = 25%
*5/12% &amp;times; 24 = 10%
*Total early claim deduction for spousal benefit = 35%
*(100 &amp;minus; 35)% &amp;times; $500 = $325

Her combined total benefit, starting at age 62 = $700 + $325 = $1,025

'''Case 2''' (wife takes at 62, husband starts taking when wife is 67 (FRA))
*Wife will get her own reduced benefit of $700 between ages 62 and 67.
*Wife will get full spouse benefit of $500 at age 67.

Her combined total benefit, starting at age 67 = $700 + $500 = $1,200

'''Case 3''' (wife takes at 67, husband already taking)
*Wife will get her own full benefit of $1,000
*Wife will get full spouse benefit of $500

Her combined total benefit = $1,000 + $500 = $1,500

==Some computational and payment details==
The following details are taken from the SSA [https://secure.ssa.gov/apps10/poms.nsf/partlist Program Operations Manual System]:
*Benefits are rounded down to the nearest dollar.
*All reductions and credits are computed using fractions, not percents.  Someone who starts a retirement benefit 6 months early will have a reduction of 6 &amp;times; 5/9% or 30/900 = 1/30.  For a PIA of $1,723.40, the benefit would be 1723.4 &amp;times; 29/30 = 1665.95 rounded down to the nearest whole dollar or $1,665.  Using a reduction of 3.33% would give an answer of 1723.4 &amp;times; 96.67% = 1666.01, which would seem to yield a benefit of $1,666 a month. This is incorrect.
*The COLA is computed in percents to one decimal place, for example, the 2009 COLA was 5.8%.  The COLA is applied to your PIA, not your benefit.
*When the PIA is computed, it is rounded down to the nearest $0.10.  For example, when a COLA of 5.8% is applied to a PIA of $1,723.40, the new PIA is 1723.4 &amp;times; 1.058 = 1823.36 rounded down to 1823.30.  With a reduction of 1/30 for starting a retirement benefit 6 months early, the new benefit will be 1823.3 &amp;times; 29/30 = 1762.52 rounded down to $1,762.  The actual increase in the retirement benefit is (1762 &amp;minus; 1665) / 1665 = 5.826%.  With another PIA, the benefit could go up slightly less than 5.8%.
*If you delay retirement past your full retirement age, the delayed credits are applied in January of the following year or in the month of attainment of age 70 if applicable.  For example, if your full retirement age is 66 and you apply for retirement benefits on your birthday in March at age 68, your initial benefit will include 22 months of delayed credits.  The additional 2 months of delayed credits for January and February will be applied the following January and affect monthly payments thereafter, but you will not receive any lump sum to make up for the amounts "missing" from the payments in that first calendar year.  Filing for your benefit to begin in January (received in Feb) means that no months are "missed," and filing for your benefit to begin in July is worst in terms of the number of months missed.  See the first link in the [[#Forum discussions|Forum discussions]] section for details.
*Benefits are paid in the month following the month earned.  In a year with a COLA, the COLA is used to compute the December benefit paid in January.  Thus the 2009 COLA, while based on the increase in CPI-W from the third quarter of 2007 to the third quarter of 2008 and applied to the December 2008 benefit, is referred to as the 2009 COLA since it first showed up in the January 2009 benefit payment. 

==Taxation==
[https://www.ssa.gov/oact/cola/cbb.html Contribution and Benefit Bases] lists historical values for annual maximum wages on which Social Security ''taxes'' are levied. For 2025, the wage maximum is $176,100, and for 2026, it is $184,500.

[http://www.irs.gov/publications/p915/index.html IRS Publication 915, Social Security and Equivalent Railroad Retirement Benefits] is the IRS version of taxing Social Security ''benefits''. 

[[Taxation of Social Security benefits]] discusses several examples of SS benefit taxation.

==Social Security application==
Although Social Security generally says you can submit your application up to 3 months before you want to begin benefits, you may request benefits to start the month of filing, a month in the past (see retroactive benefits below), or up to 4 months in the future. This request is called the "Month of Election". Benefits ''start'' the "Month of Entitlement", defined as the month in which an individual has filed an application and Social Security has confirmed that age and earnings requirements have been met.&lt;ref&gt;[https://secure.ssa.gov/poms.nsf/lnx/0200204040 GN 00204.040 Month of Election (MOEL) and Month of Entitlement (MOET)], Program Operations Manual System (POMS), retrieved July 21, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Benefits are then ''paid'' the following month, [https://faq.ssa.gov/ics/support/kbanswer.asp?QuestionID=3745 based on your birth date] for applications since 1997.

The following sections on Retroactive payments and restricted applications, Deemed filing, and Voluntary suspension are based on the many Forum contributions of [[Mike Piper]], Oblivious Investor.

===Retroactive payments===
For Social Security retirement applications filed after full retirement age (FRA), a retroactive lump sum benefit back to FRA or a maximum of six months is available.&lt;ref&gt;[https://secure.ssa.gov/poms.nsf/lnx/0200204030 GN 00204.030 Retroactivity for Title II Benefits], Program Operations Manual System (POMS), retrieved July 21, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

[https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=168328#p2533613 Forum threads] have discussed the possibility of an unwanted lump sum and reduced monthly benefits from Social Security's use of a retroactive entitlement date after FRA. To make sure that you receive all the delayed retirement credits you expect, your application should restrict its scope with "unequivocal" statements to make your intentions clear:

{{quotation|
'''GN 00204.020 Scope of the Application'''&lt;ref&gt;[https://secure.ssa.gov/poms.nsf/lnx/0200204020 GN 00204.020 Scope of the Application], Program Operations Manual System (POMS), retrieved July 21, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

. . . A claimant may choose to limit or restrict the scope of the application to exclude a class of benefits he or she may be eligible to on one or more SSNs for any reason (except where deemed filing applies). The reason may be to receive higher current benefits or to maximize the amount of benefits over a period of time, including the effect of delayed retirement credits (DRCs). (See RS 00615.480 for information on adjustment of the reduction factor.)

'''a. Before adjudication'''

The claimant must restrict the application before it is adjudicated.

'''b. Unequivocal statements'''

The claimant may restrict the application by completing appropriate blocks on the application or by signing an unequivocal statement that he or she does not wish to file for a specific benefit as follows:&lt;br&gt;
“I filed on (DATE) for all benefits for which I may be eligible except ___________”; or&lt;br&gt;
“I wish to exclude ________ benefits from the scope of this application.”&lt;br&gt;
Only unequivocal statements are acceptable. Qualifying phrases such as “at this time” or he or she plans to file in the future are not acceptable. . .}}

Sample statements to include in the application comments section would be:
{{blockquote|"I wish to receive my maximum benefit, including all delayed retirement credits to age 70. I do not wish to receive any retroactive payments based on a retirement age earlier than 70."}}

===Deemed filing===

As of April 30, 2016 the deemed filing rules apply to all applications, even if you have reached full retirement age. If you file for retirement benefits or spouse's benefits and you are also eligible for any other benefits at that time, you will be deemed to have filed for all benefits. This prevents using a restricted application to claim benefits on another's earnings record (for example, a spouse), while not claiming on your own earnings record. However, the new deemed filing rule, extending it to FRA and beyond, does not apply to those born before January 2, 1954.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ssa.gov/planners/retire/deemedfaq.html Deemed Filing For Retirement And Spouse’s Benefits FAQ's], retrieved February 9, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, deemed filing now applies automatically for anyone already receiving benefits when they become eligible for another benefit. Before April 30, 2016 deemed filing applied only when a new application was submitted.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=176706#p2672395 Changes to Social Security], Bogleheads Forum, retrieved July 21, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Voluntary suspension===

If you are already receiving Retirement Insurance Benefits (RIB) and have reached full retirement age, you can voluntarily suspend them to increase your payments with delayed retirement credits (DRCs). If you change your mind and want the payments to start before age 70, tell Social Security when you want your benefits reinstated (orally or in writing). Your request may include benefits for any months when your payments were suspended, but you will lose DRCs for any retroactive payments. Suspended payments will start automatically the month you reach age 70.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ssa.gov/planners/retire/suspend.html Retirement Planner: Suspending Retirement Benefit Payments], retrieved July 21, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|
'''GN 02409.130 Voluntary Suspension Reinstatement'''&lt;ref&gt;[https://secure.ssa.gov/apps10/poms.nsf/lnx/0202409130 GN 02409.130 Voluntary Suspension Reinstatement], Program Operations Manual System (POMS), retrieved July 21, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''A. Procedure for reinstatement at age 70'''

The Program Service Centers (PSC) use automated systems to process voluntary delayed retirement credit (VOLDRC) reinstatements at age 70. When we reinstate benefits at age 70, all VOLDRCs are credited immediately. We automatically select and process reinstatements to stop suspension with the month before the month the retirement insurance benefit (RIB) beneficiary attains age 70. For an explanation of the PSCs’ automated processes for voluntary suspension reinstatements, see SM 03020.250.

'''B. Procedure for reinstatement prior to age 70'''

The RIB beneficiary who requested suspension may at any time request benefit reinstatement as of any month in the suspension period. We will accept a written or oral request. There is no signature requirement.}}

As of April 30, 2016 the following changes apply while your benefits are suspended:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=176706#p2672395 Changes to Social Security], Bogleheads Forum, retrieved July 21, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;
# you cannot receive a benefit based on another’s earnings record, and 
# no one can receive a benefit based on your earnings record. 
These changes, along with the Deemed filing changes above, eliminated the “file and suspend” strategy allowing a spouse to collect spouse's benefits while continuing to earn DRCs on their own earnings record.

      <text bytes="19770" sha1="a4kfomdvh3t5lrth4vpif11tb98xa2r" xml:space="preserve">A '''safe withdrawal rate''' (SWR) is the quantity of money, expressed as a percentage of the initial investment, which you can withdraw per year from a portfolio, for a given quantity of time, including adjustments for inflation, without portfolio failure, where 'without failure' is a 95% probability of not running out of money at any time within the specified period.

'''Usage:''' A "safe withdrawal rate" is typically an approximation of the probability that a given portfolio can support a given annual spending component for a required period, with a reasonable confidence. To do this, you would use variables such as the allocation of assets within a model portfolio, the beginning balance, and/or the number of years expected in retirement are varied, apply a model to them, and then compare the results of altering these variables to optimize for the best outcome. 

'''Controversy:''' Unfortunately, the term "safe withdrawal rate" is ambiguous. This is because initial methods used historical data to statically determine what ''would have been'' safe, given the actual results that past portfolios would have generated with the variables given. The next logical step, of course, was to use that information to predict ''future'' SWRs. Either use is technically correct, but to avoid unnecessary arguments, you need to be clear if you use the term for past SWRs or projected SWRs.

==Studies and papers==
=== Trinity study === 
Philip L. Cooley, Carl M. Hubbard and Daniel T. Walz authored an early and influential paper, ''Retirement Savings: Choosing a Withdrawal Rate That Is Sustainable.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://incomeclub.co/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/retirement-savings-choosing-a-withdrawal-rate-that-is-sustainable.pdf| title=Retirement Savings: Choosing a Withdrawal Rate That Is Sustainable| publisher=AAII Journal| date=February 1998| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150702114906/https://incomeclub.co/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/retirement-savings-choosing-a-withdrawal-rate-that-is-sustainable.pdf| archive-date=July 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the authors were professors at Trinity University in San Antonio, Texas, it is often referred to as "the Trinity study." The authors studied actual historical stock and bond returns from 1926 through 1995 to determine sustainable withdrawal rates. The study has gained renewed significance in light of recent turbulent economy.

Using all of the historical data, the professors looked at five possible portfolio compositions, from 100 percent stocks to 100 percent bonds - the three other portfolios had a stock/bond allocation of: 75/25, 50/50, and 25/75 - and evaluated the impact of fixed annual withdrawals ranging from three percent to twelve percent. The [[S&amp;P 500 index]] represented stocks, and long-term high grade domestic bonds represented bonds.

Payout periods were in five-year intervals, from 15 to 30 years. In the study, the professors considered a portfolio successful if it ended a particular withdrawal period with a positive (not zero, and not negative) value.

The study produced a number of conclusions, including:

* Withdrawal periods longer than fifteen years dramatically reduced the probability of success at withdrawal rates exceeding five percent.
* Bonds increase the success rate for lower to mid level withdrawal rates, but most retirees would benefit with at least a 50 percent allocation to stocks.
* Retirees who want inflation-adjusted withdrawals must expect a substantially lower withdrawal rate from the initial portfolio.
* Stock-dominated portfolios using a three to four percent withdrawal rate may create rich heirs at the expense of the retiree's current standard of living.
* For a payout of fifteen years or less, a withdrawal rate of eight to nine percent from a stock-dominated portfolio appears sustainable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| publisher=New York Life| url=https://www.newyorklife.com/cda/0,3254,14198,00.html| title=Key to Making Retirement Savings Last: The Withdrawal Rate}}{{dead link}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="restud1"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.retireearlyhomepage.com/restud1.html| title=The Retire Early study on safe withdrawal rates| publisher=Retire Early Home Page| accessdate=November 13, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Limitations of the Trinity study===
One scenario backtested in the Trinity study suggests that a retiree with a suitably allocated $1&amp;nbsp;million portfolio could withdraw $40,000 the first year, give themselves a cost-of-living adjustment every year afterwards, and have a 98% chance of the portfolio lasting at least 30 years.

Taken literally, such a plan has been criticized as unrealistic. Even if the tests showed that the plan had a 98% success rate over all past time periods, would a prudent person blindly go on steadily increasing withdrawals in a prolonged bear market? It also leads to apparent absurdities. Suppose retirees Alice and Bob have saved $1&amp;nbsp;million in 2008, and the market crash reduces their portfolios to $800,000 in 2009. Alice, however, retires in 2008 while Bob waits until 2009. The Trinity study bases withdrawals the dollar value of the portfolio at the start of retirement. The value fluctuates with the vagaries of the stock market. As a result, even though their situations are almost identical, in the Trinity scenario, because Alice retired in 2008 she is allowed to withdraw $40,000 plus COLA in 2009; while Bob, despite being in an almost identical situation, would be allowed only $32,000. 

The authors of the paper, however, did not mean for their scenarios to be applied rigidly or uncritically. The article makes this very important statement:
{{quotation|The word ''planning'' is emphasized because of the great uncertainties in the stock and bond markets. Mid-course corrections likely will be required, with the actual dollar amounts withdrawn adjusted downward or upward relative to the plan. The investor needs to keep in mind that selection of a withdrawal rate is ''not'' a matter of ''contract'' but rather a matter of ''planning''.}}

[[User:Nisiprius | Nisiprius]] requested clarification from Professor Philip L. Cooley, senior author of the Trinity study:&lt;ref name="SWR"&gt;{{forum link| t=53956| title=What the Trinity Study authors meant}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quotation|What the "4% SWR" means is not that you can treat a portfolio as if it were a guaranteed annuity.

I think all the [Trinity] authors meant is that if it is late 2008 and your stocks halve in value, you don't need to halve your spending instantly. It's OK to cross your fingers and continue spending according to the 4%-then-COLAed plan, even though it means dipping into capital, and it's OK to go on doing that for a while.}}

:{{quotation|The 4% rule is the advice most often given to retirees for managing spending and investing. This rule and its variants finance a constant, non-volatile spending plan using a risky, volatile investment strategy. As a result, retirees accumulate unspent surpluses when markets outperform and face spending shortfalls when markets underperform. The previous work on this subject has focused on the probability of short falls and optimal portfolio mixes. We will focus on the rule’s inefficiencies—the price paid for funding its unspent surpluses and the overpayments made to purchase its spending policy. We show that a typical rule allocates 10%-20% of a retiree’s initial wealth to surpluses and an additional 2%-4% to overpayments. Further, we argue that even if retirees were to recoup these costs, the 4% rule’s spending plan often remains wasteful, since many retirees may actually prefer a different, cheaper spending plan.}}

Mutual funds offer you diversification, professional management, liquidity, and convenience. These advantages are offset by factors such as costs, fund turnover, and the consequences of organizational structure. You can buy mutual funds through [[broker]]s with commissions, or through firms that sell directly to investors without commissions. Funds may be actively managed, or they may use passive indexing. Funds give you access to [[money markets]], [[Developed market bonds|domestic and international bonds]], and [[Domestic/International|domestic and international stocks]]. 

==Mutual fund advantages==

Mutual funds have a number of compelling advantages.

*'''Diversification'''. The first principle of mutual fund investing is broad diversification of securities. Diversification greatly reduces and can even eliminate the risks of owning just a few individual stocks and bonds. Before the advent of mutual funds it was impossible for ordinary investors to own enough securities to minimize non-market risk. Now, even a beginning investor with $1,000 can invest in a mutual fund holding thousands of individual securities, so that the decline or bankruptcy of a single security will have almost no influence on their portfolio.&lt;ref name="bogle_on_mutual_funds"&gt;{{cite book| title=Bogle on Mutual Funds: New Perspectives for the Intelligent Investor| publisher=McGraw-Hill| date=1993| isbn=1-55623-860-6| author=John Bogle| author-link=John Bogle| pages=52-54}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Professional management'''. Managing and holding an investment portfolio means selecting and supervising the fund's holdings. Managers must do this based on the fund's objectives and policies. Index fund managers aim to mimic their benchmark index, and make no attempt to select "winning" securities. By contrast, active fund managers try to add value by selecting securities they think will perform above the average, within the fund's objectives.&lt;ref name="bogle_on_mutual_funds" /&gt;
*'''Liquidity'''. Many securities (hedge funds, limited partnerships, real estate, CDs, etc.) cannot be sold quickly and without penalty. However, you can acquire or sell most mutual fund shares at a moment's notice, at the fund's next determined [[net asset value]] per share. Also, you can easily convert mutual funds into cash at a fraction of the cost (a few funds have redemption fees) that you would pay to sell individual stocks or bonds. This is also true when exchanging mutual funds.&lt;ref name="bogle_on_mutual_funds" /&gt;
*'''Convenience'''. Mutual fund prices and performance are readily available in newspapers, magazines, internet and research organizations such as Morningstar. You can purchase them through brokers or directly with fund companies. Mutual fund companies provide automatic reinvestment of dividends and capital gains distributions, tax reporting, programs for regular additional investments and for systematic withdrawals, check writing on money market funds, telephone exchanges among different funds within the same family, and on-line account management.&lt;ref name="bogle_on_mutual_funds" /&gt;

{{Quote
|quote = '''Invest in nonprofit index funds'''. Swensen says individuals should invest in nonprofit funds that track market segments, such as the [[S&amp;P 500 index|S&amp;P 500]]. There are a range of index funds that track the U.S. domestic stock market, international markets, emerging markets and the real-estate market. Swensen says mutual funds that are organized on a not-for-profit basis don't have the same conflict of interest as for-profit funds, and they charge lower fees. The fees are even lower with nonprofit index funds, because you're not paying money managers to research stocks and buy and sell them. The fund simply holds all the stocks listed in that index. And because well-structured index funds have low churn (turnover), they are remarkably tax efficient.

According to critics, high costs, and conflicts of interest between the managers of the funds and the investor, often negate the advantages of mutual funds.

*'''Costs'''. Experts such as [[John Bogle]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://boglecenter.net/wp-content/uploads/FAJ-Relentless-Rules-11-05.pdf| title=The Relentless Rules of Humble Arithmetic| author=John Bogle| author-link=John Bogle| publisher=Financial Analysts Journal| date=2005| accessdate=June 5, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; and David Swenson&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6203264| author=David Swenson| publisher=NPR| title=Yale's Money Guru Shares Wisdom with Masses| date=October 5, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; criticise the costs of mutual fund investing. According to the [https://www.ici.org/ Investment Company Institute], the average [[Expense ratios |expense ratio]] for US stock mutual funds in 2014 was 1.33% (weighted average 0.70%), while the average expense ratio for US bond mutual funds was 0.98% (weighted average 0.57%).&lt;ref name="ici2015_ch5"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.ici.org/pdf/2015_factbook.pdf| title=ICI 2015 Mutual Fund Fact Book (chapter five)| publisher=Investment Company Institute| accessdate=June 5, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to John Bogle, while mutual fund assets rose 1,600-fold from 1950-2004, mutual fund expenses rose 2,400 fold.&lt;ref name="bogle_battle"&gt;{{cite book| author=John Bogle| author-link=John Bogle| date=2005| title=The Battle for the Soul of Capitalism| publisher=Yale University Press| pages=154,184| isbn=0-300-10990-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; These costs directly reduce investor returns. The expense ratio does not include sales loads or fund [[Mutual funds: additional costs#Transaction Costs |transaction costs]]. 
*'''Turnover'''. John Bogle points out that from 1945 to 1965, stock mutual funds maintained an average turnover of 17 percent (an average holding period of six years). Since 1965, turnover has increased to a present day average of 100 percent (average holding period of one year).&lt;ref name="bogle_battle" /&gt; Increased turnover to these levels creates greater frictional transaction costs for a fund, and also increases the likelihood of realized taxable gains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://boglecenter.net/wp-content/uploads/JCB_AAII0505.pdf| title=The Arithmetic of Mutual Fund Investing is More Important Than Ever| author=John Bogle| author-link=John Bogle| publisher=American Association of Individual Investor, Philadelphia Chapter| date=May 24, 2005| accessdate=June 5, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Organizational structure'''. According to critics, the [[Mutual fund structure | basic structure]] of the mutual fund, where an external management company owns the mutual fund is inherently riddled with conflicts of interest. The external management company's profits to its shareholders must come from mutual fund shareholders. In 2006, the top thirty mutual fund management companies had a corporate structure breakdown that consisted of nineteen large conglomerates; seven publicly owned firms; and four privately held firms. In addition, fund acquisitions and mergers have produced little realized value for fund shareholders. Luo and Qiao (2013) find that "acquiring families keep most of the acquired funds intact, and merge a small fraction of the acquired funds with a few of their incumbent funds. Most involved funds, including the acquired funds and the incumbent funds that remain intact, have a performance deterioration. There is little evidence that fund expenses decrease or fund liquidity increases."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author1=Jiang Luo| author2=Zheng Qiao| url=https://ssrn.com/abstract=2251726| title=On the Mergers and Acquisitions of Mutual Fund Families: The Determinants and Subsequent Impact on Fund Performance| date=April 9, 2013}}{{dead link}} Available at SSRN.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of mutual funds==
Mutual funds give you access to diversified portfolios of the major asset classes: [[Money markets|money markets]], [[Bond basics|bonds]], and [[Stock basics|stocks]], as well as access to discrete market segments of each market.

Funds may be actively managed, where the investment manager tries to outperform a benchmark index, or indexed, where the investment manager aims to match a benchmark index return. Mutual funds may or may not have a sales commission.

===Load funds===
{{Main|Mutual funds and fees}}
Mutual funds sold by full service brokerages, banks, and commissioned advisors usually impose a sales charge on investors known as a "sales load". You might pay the sales load upfront upon purchase, or deferred until you sell fund shares; this deferred charge is often called a "contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC)". These sales charges are on top of the fund's expense ratio, and any other transaction charges the fund may impose. Different share classes usually indicate sales charges, as follows:

*'''A-shares'''. A-shares have a front end charge on initial investment. A fund issuing A-shares might have a 5% load upon purchase, so that if you commit $10,000 to the fund, you would actually invest $9,500 in the fund, with $500 going to the sales agent as a commissioned load. A-shares may also have an additional 0.25% annual charge (known as a 12b-1 fee).
*'''B-shares'''. B-shares do not charge an upfront load. Instead the shares impose a back end redemption fee combined with a 1% annual charge (12b-1 fee). The redemption fee usually declines each year until it eventually reaches zero. The combination of the annual charge and the redemption fee assures that the full load is eventually paid. The fund's prospectus will show the exact rate at which these fees will decline. Ordinarily, B-shares convert to A-shares (and reduced 12b-1 charges) once the CDSC reaches zero.
*'''C-shares'''. C-shares do not charge an upfront load. C-shares are sold with a 1% CDSC for the first year, plus a 1% 12b-1 fee. The redemption fee is eliminated during year two. Unlike B-shares, C-shares never convert to A-shares; holders pay the added 1% 12b-1 fee for as long as they hold the fund.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.sec.gov/about/reports-publications/investor-publications/introduction-mutual-funds | title=Mutual Funds and Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) – A Guide for Investors| publisher=SEC| accessdate=June 5, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===No-load funds===

A no-load mutual fund distributes its fund shares directly with an investor. Thus a no-load mutual fund does not employ the sales charge fees that load funds impose on shareholders. This is a distinct advantage for the do-it-yourself investor. 

However a no-load fund may impose the following fees, on top of the expense ratio that all funds have:
*'''Transaction fees'''. Mutual funds incur costs buying and selling securities for the fund; for more, see: [[Mutual funds: additional costs]]. Some funds cover the costs associated with an individual investor’s transactions by charging [[Purchase fee|purchase fees]] and [[Redemption fee |redemption fees]] directly to the investor at the time of the transactions to cover these costs. Unlike sales charges, these fees are usually paid back into the fund. Funds may also charge a redemption fee to deter short term market timing selling of the fund.
*'''Maintenance fees'''. Some funds may charge a separate maintenance fee for low balance fund accounts.
* '''12b-1 fees'''. A no-load fund is permitted to charge a maximum 0.25% 12b-1 fee and still remain classified as a no-load fund. The main reason that a fund might impose a 0.25% is for purchasing access to a brokerage firm's "fund supermarket". The fee allows the brokerage to offer the fund as a "No Transaction Fee" fund in the supermarket.

===Mutual fund categories===
====Money market funds====
{{Main|Money markets}}
{{Quote
|quote = Money funds are regulated under [https://www.law.uc.edu/CCL/InvCoRls/rule2a-7.html Rule 2a-7] of the [[wikipedia:Investment Company Act of 1940|Investment Company Act of 1940]]. Key provisions of the regulations require the following:

* '''Maturity'''. Money funds can only invest in money market instruments maturing under 12 months, and must maintain a weighted average maturity of 60 days or less.
* '''Diversification'''. With the exception of federal government securities, money funds may not invest more than 5 percent of their assets in a single issuer.
* '''Credit Quality'''. Money funds must limit their investments to securities that are rated in one of the two highest short-term rating categories by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization (NRSRO). Investment in second-tier securities is limited to 3% of total fund assets, with a limit of 0.5% for any single issuer. Investment in second tier securities is restricted to maturities of 45 days or less.

Under the 2014 [https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2014/08/14/2014-17747/money-market-fund-reform-amendments-to-form-pf#h-186 SEC final rules], money funds are divided into three classes: institutional, retail, and government. Institutional money funds must have a floating NAV based on market values. The rules also provide for liquidity (redemption) fees and gates (suspended redemption) during periods of market distress. In summary:

* A fund may impose a fee of up to 2% on redemptions if the fund's weekly liquid assets fall below 30% of its total assets.
* A fund must impose a 1% fee on redemptions (with the option of imposing a fee of up to 2%) if the fund's weekly liquid assets fall below 10% of its total assets—unless the fund's board determines a fee would not be in the fund's best interest.
* A fund may impose a gate—that is, suspend redemptions—for up to 10 business days in a 90-day period.
* The fees and gates rules only apply to retail and institutional funds, although government funds may voluntarily adopt them if the fees and gates are previously disclosed to investors.

Money market funds are mutual funds that invest in short term (less than one year) money market instruments. [[Money markets#Marketable money market instruments|Money market fund investments]] include treasury bills, commercial paper, bank CDs and banker's acceptances. By design, they are meant to maintain stable net asset valuations of 1.00 dollar per share, and provide investors with interest dividends. They are therefore suitable investments for savings and other short term needs.

Although money market funds are low risk, they are not zero-risk. If some of the underlying investments default, the fund may not be able to maintain a [[Net asset value|net asset value]] of $1.00/share; this failure is colloquially known as ''breaking the buck''. As of November, 2009, there have been only a [[The 2008 money market crisis |few cases]] when this has actually happened. Most notably, two money-market funds of The Reserve Funds ''broke the buck'' in September, 2008, after Lehman went bankrupt.

Money funds are characterized by the underlying investments comprising the portfolio. This specialization allows funds to differentiate by risk and tax characteristics. Money funds include:

* '''General (Prime) money funds'''. These funds invest in a large range of money fund instruments: [[Treasury bill|treasury bills]], CDs, Yankee CDs, Eurodollar CDs, [[Commercial paper|commercial paper]], and [[Banker's acceptance|banker's acceptances]]. These funds are usually heavily weighted towards the non-treasury instruments. Since these instruments are exposed to credit risks, they provide higher interest coupons than treasuries (this excess interest can be called the default risk premium). The non-treasury component of a General money market fund is taxable income at both federal and state levels.
* '''Treasury money funds'''. Treasury money funds invest 100% in "full faith and credit" treasury bills and agency instruments. As a result, they are not subject to credit risk (because the treasury has monopoly power to print fiat currency). Treasury interest is exempt from state income taxation.
* '''Tax-exempt funds'''. These funds invest in municipal money market instruments. The interest is generally exempt from federal taxation (although some interest may be subject to the [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/alternativeminimumtax.asp alternative minimum tax]). State specific tax exempt funds invest in municipal securities of an individual state and so provide federal, state, and sometimes local tax exempt interest for state residents. Tax exempt funds are subject to credit risk as well as the risk of tax law change to their exemption status.

If you hold these in a taxable account, you need to compare the after tax yields of a given money fund to determine whether the fund will yield the highest after tax income. For more, see: [[Money markets#After-tax yields |After-tax yields]].

Costs are an important factor in money market fund selection. Because the total return of a money market fund is the income payment, the lower the expense ratio of the fund, the higher your net return. A low cost money fund can hold the highest quality money market instruments and still provide competitive yields.

====Bond funds====
{{Main|Bond basics}}
Bond mutual funds invest in fixed income securities with maturities ranging from one year to thirty (or more) years. Bond funds may hold the following [[Bond basics#Types of bonds |types of bonds]]:
*Government bonds
*Corporate bonds
*Asset-backed securities
*Foreign bonds
*Tax-exempt bonds
Each of these general bond categories contain discrete segments of the bond market. Bond funds may hold an aggregate of the taxable or tax exempt bond markets, or they may hold just a specific segment of the market. The following table outlines the segments of the bond market.

Bond funds distinguish by the types of bonds held in the portfolio, the [[Wikipedia:Bond credit rating|credit quality]] of the bonds, and by the [[Bonds: advanced topics#Duration | average maturity]] of the bond portfolio. As a general rule, lower quality and longer maturity bonds provide higher interest coupons, to compensate for the added [[Bond basics#risks |risk]]. Treasury securities have the highest credit quality. Corporate, asset-backed, and tax-exempt bonds are subject to various default and other risks and are rated by rating agencies for credit worthiness. Ratings range from investment grade (the highest rating) to bonds in default.

[[File:Morningstarfixedstylebox.GIF|200px|thumb|Figure 1. Morningstar Fixed Income Style Box. Maturity along x-axis; credit quality on y-axis.]]
Typically, a bond fund in any given segment of the market will be a part of a series of funds providing short, intermediate, and long term maturities. These tiered maturity portfolios allow you to match a bond fund to an expected holding period, and to maintain your portfolio's exposure to interest rate risk. You can usually find bond funds with the following maturities:

*'''Short term bond funds'''. Maturities between 1 year and 5 years.
*'''Intermediate term bond funds'''. Maturities between 5 years and 10 years.
*'''Long term bond funds'''. Maturities greater than 10 years.

A fund will have an average maturity based on the proportion of fund assets represented by each bond held in the portfolio.

The two main risk characteristics of a bond fund, credit quality and maturity, are often graphically presented in a Morningstar style box. See Figure 1 for an example.

Because bond funds distribute income, taxable bonds are often candidates for placement in tax advantaged accounts (see [[Tax-efficient fund placement]]). For taxable accounts, some bonds have tax preferences. Treasury securities are generally exempt from state income tax. Tax exempt bonds are generally exempt from federal taxation and, to the extent that the bond is issued by your state of residence, may also be exempt from state and local taxation (although some interest may be subject to the [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/alternativeminimumtax.asp alternative minimum tax]). These tax preferences often result in lower yields for treasury and municipal bonds in comparison to corporate and other non-preference bonds. You need to compare the after tax yields of a given fund to determine whether the fund will yield the highest after tax income (see: [[Money markets#After-tax yields |After-tax yields]]).

Costs are a critical factor in long term bond fund performance. A low cost bond fund can hold higher quality, less risky bonds and still provide higher long term returns than many higher cost funds holding lower quality bonds.

====Stock funds====
{{Main|Stock basics}}
Stock mutual funds are extremely diverse. There are funds that invest in the American stock markets, funds that invest in [[Domestic/International |international markets]], and funds that invest [[S&amp;P Global Broad Market Index |globally]]. Within each market, there are funds that invest in the entire market, funds that invest in specific segments of the market, and funds that specialize in [[Stock basics#Sector | specific industry sectors]] of the market.

Stocks funds are often classified by the average size of the companies they hold as investments. This is most commonly done by looking at the market capitalization of a firm. [[Market capitalization]] is simply a measurement found by taking a stock's current share price and multiplying it by the number of stock shares outstanding.

[[File:Morningstarequitystylebox.GIF|200px|thumb|Figure 2. Morningstar Equity Style Box. Style along x-axis; Market Capitalization along y-axis.]]
Exact market cap ranges will vary among different financial and rating institutions, but there are three common terms that describe stocks by their general size. 

*'''Large capitalization stocks''':&lt;br&gt;Large cap stocks have a market cap over $10 billion dollars.
*'''Mid capitalization stocks''':&lt;br&gt;Mid cap stocks have a market cap between $2 billion and $10 billion dollars.
*'''Small capitalization stocks''':&lt;br&gt;Small cap stocks have a market cap between $300 million and $2 billion dollars.

While these are the most common market cap references, there are also some less common ones: mega cap (greater than $200 billion); micro cap (between $50 million and $300 million); and nano cap (below $50 million). Market cap terms are relative and change constantly as companies get bigger and smaller.

Stock funds may also be classified by "style," either Growth, Value, or Blend. Growth stock funds invest in companies that are growing their profits at a very fast rate and are expected to continue to grow at an increasing rate. Value stock funds hold stocks that tend to trade at deep discount relative to their intrinsic value (as defined by profits, book value and other measures). Blend funds tend to hold a mixture of growth and value stocks.

The combination of size and style metrics allows a fund to be classified in a Morningstar Equity style box (see Figure 2).

As well as size and style classifications, some international stock funds are specialized by regions. The most common regional fund classifications are:
*European
*Pacific
*Emerging markets

International Developed Market funds usually combine the European and Pacific regions.

====Balanced funds====
{{Main|Balanced fund}}
Balanced funds (sometimes also referred to as hybrid funds) invest in a portfolio that includes stocks and bonds, and sometimes cash and commodities. Usually these type funds have a fixed asset allocation mix, generally with moderate (60 percent stock/40 percent bond) or conservative (40 percent stock/60 percent bond) equity allocations. Balanced funds also include the following types of funds:

*'''Asset allocation funds'''. These funds can be designed to hold a fixed asset allocation of asset classes, but are commonly funds which allow a fund manager to shift allocations according to a [[tactical asset allocation]] strategy.
*'''Life cycle funds'''. These funds usually offer portfolios that hold a static asset allocation, usually labeled as growth, moderate, conservative, and income portfolios. They are often designed as fund of funds (see [[#Fund of funds|below]]).
*'''Target retirement funds'''. These funds are designed primarily for retirement plans. They are usually designed as fund of funds (see [[#Fund of funds|below]]).

Balanced funds offer the advantage of a simplified investment program. The portfolios include multiple asset classes and are self-balancing. However, investors whose portfolios are divided between taxable accounts and tax deferred/tax free accounts often deliberately avoid balanced funds in favor of separate asset class funds, allocated across accounts using [[tax-efficient fund placement]].

====Fund of funds====
{{Main|Fund of funds}}
A fund of funds differs from most mutual funds, in that the fund invests in mutual funds rather than individual securities. Fund of funds are primarily designed for [[:Category:Retirement planning | retirement plans]] and [[:Category:Education savings | education savings plans]]. Fund of funds have two basic forms:
*'''Static portfolios'''. These portfolios hold a steady predetermined allocation mix of stock funds, bond funds, or a balanced mix of stock and bond funds. A variation on this type fund allows a manager to shift the stock/bond/cash allocation according to a [[tactical asset allocation]] strategy.
*'''Target date portfolios'''. These fund of funds hold a targeted asset allocation that [[Glide paths | grows more heavily weighted towards bonds]] as the target date (for retirement or entry into college) approaches. These [[Target date retirement funds | funds]] are commonly used in [[Employer retirement plans overview | corporate retirement plans]] and in the [[529 plans | 529 plan]] market.

Fund of funds may use funds from the same advisory firm, or the fund manager (usually with an added management fee) may select funds from different advisors.

Fund of funds have what is known as an [[Acquired fund fees and expenses | ''acquired fund fee'']], a measure which includes the weighted expense ratio of the underlying funds as well as any additional expense ratio imposed by the investment manager.

====Index funds====
{{Main|Indexing}}
Indexing is an investment management strategy that aims to replicate the investment performance of a market index. An index is a statistical measure of a market's value and performance and serves as a benchmark against which an investment manager's performance is judged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Rick Ferri| author-link=Rick Ferri| title=All About Index Funds: The Easy Way to Get Started| isbn=978-0-07-148492-3| pages=10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, a large number of [[Stock market indexing |index providers]], including S&amp;P, Dow Jones, MSCI, Russell, FTSE, CRSP and Morningstar, provide a wide range of indexes covering [[Stock basics| US]] and [[Domestic/International | international]] stocks, [[Bond basics| bonds]], and [[commodities]]. A well managed, low cost index fund is an excellent, if not optimal, investment vehicle for investing in the overall stock market, in discrete market segments, in the bond markets, and in the commodity markets.

Advantages:
[[Image:Highcost-lowcost.jpg|thumb|Figure 3. Investment growth of both a low-cost and high-cost fund&lt;ref group="note"&gt;
Both funds assume an initial $10,000 investment and an identical 8% annual growth. The time period is 30 years.
The low-cost fund is no-load and has expenses of 0.2% per year.
The high-cost fund has an initial 5.75% sales load, expenses of 2.0% per year, and a 0.25% 12b-1 fee.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

*'''Low costs'''. According to the [https://www.ici.org/ Investment Company Institute], the average expense ratio for US stock mutual funds in 2014 was 1.33% (weighted average 0.70%), while the average expense ratio for US bond mutual funds was 0.98% (weighted average 0.57%).&lt;ref name="ici2015_ch5" /&gt; Index funds are available to investors for expense ratios of 0.20% and lower from firms such as [[Vanguard]], [[Fidelity]], [[Schwab]], and many [[Exchange-traded funds|exchange-traded funds]]. These low expenses mean that a greater portion of market returns accrue to the mutual fund shareholder where they can continue to compound, as opposed to being siphoned off through intermediaries. As Figure 3 demonstrates, indexing's cost advantage builds steadily over long holding periods. In addition to low expense ratios, index funds can provide low transaction costs, which include brokerage commission costs, [[bid/ask spread]]s, and market impact costs (institutional purchases and sales can drive the price of a security up or down before the order is filled.) 
*'''Tax efficiency'''. Because of lower fund turnover and longer holding periods, stock index funds tend to be more tax efficient than actively managed stock funds. This is especially true for total market index funds, large cap index funds, and large growth index funds. These funds rarely realize and distribute a capital gain (and any small capital gains distributions are usually long term gains taxed at reduced tax rates.) Deferring capital gains tax liabilities means higher after tax returns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.ifa.com/Media/Images/PDF%20files/IsYourAlphaBigEnough.pdf| author1=Robert H. Jeffrey| author2=Robert D. Arnott| title=Is Your Alpha Big Enough To Cover Its Taxes?| date=1993| publisher=First Quadrant Corporation| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221102032136/https://www.ifa.com/media/images/pdf%20files/isyouralphabigenough.pdf| archive-date=November 2, 2022| accessdate=June 3, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, since the introduction of the tax regime for [[Qualified dividend | qualified dividends]] in 2004, well-managed total market and large cap indexes have been able to provide investors with 100% qualified dividends, taxed at lower tax rates
*'''Asset class style consistency'''. Index funds are designed to provide the returns of the asset class they are tracking. This allows an investor to control the asset allocation decision.
*'''Reduced manager risk'''. Actively managed funds expose investors to two manager risks.
** The risk that the manager will under perform the benchmark return,
** The risk that the manager will leave the fund. For taxable investors, selling a fund after a manager change could result in a large capital gains tax.
*Index funds greatly reduce these manager risks.
** The risk of under performing a benchmark return is lower (although not eliminated, due to sampling and tracking errors.)
** An investment team manages index funds. One fund manager leaving does not materially affect the management of the fund.
*'''Simplicity'''. The low cost, high tax efficiency, and long term consistency of performance advantages of indexing all help to simplify how you select and monitor funds for your investment plan.

An '''exchange-traded fund''', or '''ETF''', is a registered investment company. An ETF is a fund that holds a collection of assets and is traded on the market, and investors buy or sell from another shareholder on the stock exchange. ETFs have a creation and redemption procedure that generally makes the difference between price and [[Net asset value |NAV]] very small. 

Besides ETFs, other forms of the registered investment company include [[Mutual fund | mutual funds]], [[Closed End Funds | closed-end funds]], and [[Unit investment trusts | unit investment trusts]]. Legally, an ETF is classified as an open end company or unit investment trust,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/investing-basics/glossary/exchange-traded-fund-etf| title=Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF)| publisher=Investor.gov| accessdate=August 13, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in the U.S. a number of other exchange traded products which are not regulated investment companies are often grouped under the exchange traded fund banner. These products include exchange traded grantor trusts, exchange traded notes (ETNs), and certain exchange traded partnerships ([[Master limited partnership|MLPs]]).&lt;ref name="ETFGUide"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.etfguide.com:80/exchangetradedfunds.htm| title=ETF Guide: ETF History| publisher=etfguide| date=2013| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130308040157/http://www.etfguide.com:80/exchangetradedfunds.htm| archive-date=March 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ETFs are like mutual funds in that they hold a collection of assets, usually [[Stock basics|stocks]], [[Bond basics|bonds]] or other securities. Like closed-ended funds, ETFs trade on the market at a premium or discount from their [[net asset value]] (NAV). However, unlike closed-end funds, which often trade at large discounts or premiums to NAV, a special procedure for creating or redeeming shares allows institutional investors to perform arbitrage by swapping blocks of securities for ETF shares. This creation/redemption procedure, implemented by [[authorized participants]], generally makes the difference between price and NAV very small. 

At year end 2015, ETFs in the U.S. totaled 1,597 funds holding 2.1 trillion dollars in net assets.{{#tag:ref|'''Number of ETFs and total net assets (billions of dollars)'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.ici.org/publications| title=Investment Company Institute Factbooks| publisher=ICI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
{{Quote
|quote = &lt;u&gt;SEC: Distinguishing Features of ETFs&lt;/u&gt;
*ETFs do not sell individual shares directly to investors and only issue their shares in large blocks (blocks of 50,000 shares, for example) that are known as "Creation Units."
*Investors generally do not purchase Creation Units with cash. Instead, they buy Creation Units with a basket of securities that generally mirrors the ETF’s portfolio. Those who purchase Creation Units are frequently institutions.
*After purchasing a Creation Unit, an investor often splits it up and sells the individual shares on a secondary market. This permits other investors to purchase individual shares (instead of Creation Units).
*Investors who want to sell their ETF shares have two options: (1) they can sell individual shares to other investors on the secondary market, or (2) they can sell the Creation Units back to the ETF. In addition, ETFs generally redeem Creation Units by giving investors the securities that comprise the portfolio instead of cash. So, for example, an ETF invested in the stocks contained in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) would give a redeeming shareholder the actual securities that constitute the DJIA instead of cash. Because of the limited redeemability of ETF shares, ETFs are not considered to be—and may not call themselves—mutual funds.

ETFs investing in stocks and bonds are usually structured as open-end funds or unit investment trusts. Commodities and currencies are usually structured as either grantor trusts, Exchange Traded Notes (ETNs) or as Master Limited Partnerships (MLPs). The following chart allows you to more easily visualize the four major ETF product structures. 

[[File:ETPs.jpg|center|thumb|400px|Image courtesy of [[Rick Ferri]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.rickferri.com/blog/investments/etfs-explained-part-1-products/| title=ETFs Explained (Part 1 – Products)| author=Rick Ferri| author-link=Rick Ferri| date=May 9, 2011| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923024546/http://www.rickferri.com/blog/investments/etfs-explained-part-1-products/| archive-date=September 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

===Open end fund=== 
The most flexible and most common form of ETF structure is the open end fund, which is registered under the [[wikipedia:Investment Company Act of 1940|Investment Company Act of 1940]]. This structure has the following characteristics:
# The fund has a board of directors.
# The fund can replicate or sample an index.
# The fund can invest in derivatives.
# The fund can engage in security lending. Some ETF providers (including Vanguard) allocate all security lending income to the ETF; other ETF providers (among them iShares) divide security lending income between the ETF and the management company.
# Dividends are immediately reinvested and paid to shareholders (monthly or quarterly).
# Tax reporting is done with an IRS 1099 document.&lt;ref name="ETFGUide" /&gt;

===Unit investment trust=== 
Unit investment trusts (UITs) are registered under the [[wikipedia:Investment Company Act of 1940|Investment Company Act of 1940]]. While most ETF providers use the open end structure, a number of large ETFs used the UIT structure, for example SPDRs&lt;ref group="note"&gt;SPDR stands for Standard and Poor’s Depositary Receipts. It is a unit of an ETF that holds shares of all the companies in the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500 Composite Stock Price Index ([[S&amp;P 500 index]]). See also: [http://www.sec.gov/answers/spiders.htm Spiders (SPDRs)], from the SEC&lt;/ref&gt; and QQQs.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;QQQ is based on the NASDAQ-100 Index. See also: [https://www.invesco.com/qqq-etf/en/about.html About QQQ], from Invesco&lt;/ref&gt; Characteristics include:
# As a trust, the fund has no board of directors. The trust must be periodically renewed.
# The fund can only replicate an index.
# The fund cannot invest in derivatives.
# The fund cannot lend its securities.
# Dividends are not reinvested in the fund, but are held until paid to shareholders quarterly or annually. The ETF can suffer cash drag.
# Tax reporting is done with an IRS 1099 document.&lt;ref name="ETFGUide" /&gt;

===Grantor trust=== 
Grantor trusts&lt;ref name="ETFGUide" /&gt; are registered under the [[wikipedia:Securities Act of 1933|Securities Act of 1933]]. This structure is used for currency and commodity exchange traded vehicles. Characteristics include:
# The trust invests in a customized basket of securities that remains fixed (for HOLDRS stocks can be removed via merger and acquisition).
# The investor is considered as directly owning the underlying assets in the trust. Thus, the shareholder receives all company annual and semiannual reports, and all company proxies.
# Dividends are distributed directly to shareholders and are not reinvested.
# Tax reporting is done through a Grantor Trust Letter.
# Tax reporting can be complicated. Gold bullion and silver bullion ETFs are taxed as collectibles, subject to long term capital gains tax rates up to 28%, and the small sales of bullion used to pay trust expenses are considered taxable sales for shareholders that must be reported each year. In some instances, commodity ETFs using futures contracts must mark to market the futures positions at year end and investors are taxed each year on any gains, even if you do not sell the ETF. Capital gains on future contracts, regardless of holding period, are currently taxed at a hybrid rate of 60% long-term and 40% short-term gains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://etfguide.com/etfproductstructure.htm| title=ETF Product Structures| publisher=etfguide.com |url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130202063950/http://etfguide.com/etfproductstructure.htm| archive-date=February 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Etfguide.com states: "For investors in the highest tax bracket, this 60/40 split creates a maximum blended capital gains tax rate of 23%. The tax burden is reduced for investors in lower income brackets."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://etfguide.com/etfcommodity.htm| title=The Case for Commodities| publisher=etfguide.com| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130202063937/http://etfguide.com/etfcommodity.htm| archive-date=February 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exchange traded note===
{{Notice|The FINRA has released an investor alert about the risks involved when investing in Exchange traded notes (ETNs). See: [{{{url|https://web.archive.org/web/20181009094627/http://www.finra.org/investors/alerts/exchange-traded-notes-avoid-surprises}}} Exchange-Traded Notes - Avoid Unpleasant Surprises]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.finra.org/investors/alerts/exchange-traded-notes-avoid-surprises| title=Exchange-Traded Notes - Avoid Unpleasant Surprises| publisher=Financial Industry Regulatory Authority| date=July 10, 2012| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181009094627/http://www.finra.org/investors/alerts/exchange-traded-notes-avoid-surprises| archive-date=October 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Exchange traded notes (ETNs) are registered under the [[wikipedia:Securities Act of 1933|Securities Act of 1933]]. ETNs track a wide assortment of asset classes: stocks, bonds, currencies, commodities. Characteristics include:
# ETNs are senior, unsecured, unsubordinated debt securities issued by banks. They are subject to both investment risk and credit risk. In 2008, the failure of Lehman Brothers resulted in the delisting of the firm's three ETNs.
# ETNs track a benchmark index. At maturity an investor receives a cash payment equaling the performance of the benchmark, less fees. The most representative fee is 0.75% per year (range 0.30% - 0.89%).
# ETNs, as debt instruments, do not have a net asset value. However, current intrinsic value is expressed by an Intraday Indicative Value (IIV) computation.
# Most ETNs are considered by sponsors to be prepaid contracts, with tax liability deferred until maturity, liquidation, or sale by the investor. This tax status is subject to change at the discretion of the IRS; in 2007 the IRS ruled that currency note interest would be taxed as current income regardless of the fact that the payment of interest would not occur until maturity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/irb/2008-02_IRB/ar08.html| title=Internal Revenue Bulletin: 2008-2| publisher=IRS| date=January 14, 2008| accessdate=August 13, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ETFGUide" /&gt;

===Costs===
ETFs are subject to the costs of managing the portfolio as well as transaction costs when buying and selling the stock. Here is a breakdown of the costs you will incur:

*''[[Expense Ratios | Expense ratio]]'': the annual management fee for a mutual fund or ETF expressed as a percentage. It is charged directly to the fund/ETF.
*''Commission'': the up-front charge by your [[broker]] to buy or sell a stock or ETF.
*''[[Bid/ask spread]]'': the price difference between what a seller asks and what a buyer offers for a stock or ETF.
*''Premium and discount'': the difference between the trading price and the NAV of an ETF.

When buying or selling ETFs, consider using a [[Orders#Exchange Traded Funds | limit order]] to obtain the best price.

[https://www.nyse.com/listings_directory/etf The New York Stock Exchange] lists the daily closing bid-ask and premium-discount information for many popular ETFs. Select the ETF to view the latest quote.

===Taxes===
The ETF structure is likely to make stock ETFs more tax-efficient than stock mutual funds. 

When a mutual fund or ETF sells a stock, it has a taxable capital gain (or loss) equal to the difference between what it received and what it paid. When an institutional investor converts shares of an ETF to stock, the ETF provider can give away the shares of stock with the lowest purchase price; these are the shares which would have the highest gain if sold. Because of this, ETFs can often reduce the capital gains they must distribute. The ETF redemption process does not reduce dividends; therefore, taxable bond and REIT ETFs, asset classes with total returns comprised primarily of [[Non-qualified dividends | non-qualified dividend]] income, still have a high tax cost.

The redemption process is more effective at reducing capital gains when the ETF has purchased shares at a wide range of prices. As a result, many ETFs distributed capital gains in their first year or two of operations, but not subsequently; see the individual providers in the [[#ETF providers|ETF providers]] section for distribution information on individual ETFs.

A potential tax disadvantage to the creation-redemption process is that ETFs may redeem stocks which have paid a dividend before meeting the 61-day holding requirement for [[qualified dividend]]s. As a result, some ETFs have fewer qualified dividends than similar mutual funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{forum link| t=40143| title=Gus Sauter comments on Vanguard ETF structure}}, including quotes from Vanguard.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Most Vanguard ETFs have no tax advantage over the corresponding Vanguard index funds, because in most cases the ETF is a share class of the index fund and thus the mutual fund shares the tax benefits of the ETF. 

Many of Vanguard's ETFs were added as share classes to existing mutual funds and were able to avoid the first-year effect of distributing capital gains. FTSE All-World Ex US Small-Cap, which was created simultaneously as a fund and an ETF, distributed small gains in its first two years (2009 and 2010), and Consumer Staples Index also distributed a gain in its first year (2004). 

Only a few other Vanguard ETFs have distributed gains. REIT Index, which added an ETF class to an existing fund which generates a lot of gains, distributed gains in 2004-2008, 2016, and 2017. International Dividend Achievers Index, which changed indexes in 2021, distributed a 6% capital gain that year, half short-term.

===Risks===
With the global increase in the number of ETFs and the complexity of some of them (as is the case with [[Synthetic ETF]]s), three international bodies have expressed worries about them. See [http://www.economist.com/node/18864254 Too Much of a Good Thing, The risks created by Complicating a Simple Idea] in The Economist, June 23, 2011.

==How to convert mutual funds to ETFs at Vanguard==
{{See also|Vanguard Bond ETFs|Vanguard Domestic Sector ETFs|Vanguard Domestic Stock ETFs|Vanguard International ETFs}}

It is possible to convert conventional mutual fund shares to ETFs without any tax consequences. This is free at Vanguard, and is possible at other brokers which may charge a fee. To do this at Vanguard, you need to first open a Vanguard Brokerage Account to hold the ETF shares, then call Vanguard Brokerage to do the conversion over the phone.
{{Notice|
When converting from a mutual fund to an ETF, do not sell the fund if it has a gain or a taxable event will occur. Contact Vanguard and request a conversion, which will be done at NAV as an exchange from one type of share class to another.&lt;ref&gt;{{forum link| t=54843| title=Free ETFs at VG. But why ETFs?}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}
Redemption fees are not charged when you convert mutual fund shares to ETFs (or to Admiral shares). 

The conversion rate is determined by the closing NAV of the ETF (not market price) and the closing NAV of the mutual fund using the below formula. If this formula does not produce a whole number, you receive fractional ETF shares for the remainder. 

:Number of ETF shares = (number of mutual fund shares) &amp;times; (mutual fund NAV / ETF closing NAV)

Notice that the ETF market price is not in the equation. 

If you convert on a premium day, you will see a small uplift; if you convert on a discount day, you will see a small loss. But either way, conversion is based on the underlying NAVs, so everything evens out once the premium or discount changes. You are not actually selling and buying, so it should not make a difference in the long run.&lt;ref&gt;{{forum link| t=54920| title=Conversion of mutual funds to corresponding ETF question}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Here is the timeline from a user's experience of converting Vanguard funds held in a Vanguard IRA mutual fund account:&lt;ref&gt;{{forum link| p=732364| title=WellsTrade can convert Vanguard funds to ETFs for free}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{blockquote|
* Tuesday afternoon applied for VG brokerage accounts online
* Wednesday afternoon/evening sign some exchange agreements online to open the brokerage account.
* Thursday morning called Vanguard at 866-499-8473 to do the conversion of REIT and FTSE ex-US small index funds. 
* Friday AM the mutual fund shares disappeared (be prepared as you see a huge drop in your account balance)
* Saturday AM the ETF shares appeared, using above formula numbers were correct using Thursday's closing NAVs.

'''Paying down loans versus investing''' is an investment choice you may have if you have money available but you also have an outstanding loan. This article looks at the choice of how to deploy the money and the pros and cons to be considered.

==Viewing it as an investment choice==
If you have money that you could invest, but you also have a loan, you have the option of using the money to pay down the loan instead. Paying down the loan will give you a guaranteed return by reducing your future loan balance, and eventually eliminating future loan payments or giving you more money when the loan is paid off. This is the same benefit that you get from a fixed-income investment such as a [[Bond basics | bond]] or [[certificate of deposit]] (CD), which also gives you fixed amounts of money at specified future times. 

Therefore, it makes sense to treat paying down a loan like a bond investment, and compare this option to your other investment options.

'''Example''': You have a credit card with a $5,000 balance and an APR of 10%. Your current net worth is $20,000. You have received $1,000 in cash (which is included in the $20,000). You are deciding what to do with the cash.

* If you do nothing with that cash, the credit card's interest will make your net worth $19,500 in one year's time ($20,000 - 10% &amp;times; $5,000).
* If you use the $1,000 to pay down the credit card, your net worth will be $20,000 - $4,000 &amp;times; 10% = $19,600
* If you invest the $1,000 in a bond paying 5% (''after taxes''), your net worth will be $19,500 + $1,000 &amp;times; 5% = $19,550.
* If you invest the $1,000 in a bond paying 10% (''after taxes''), your net worth will be $19,500 + $1,000 &amp;times; 10% = $19,600.

As can be seen, paying down the credit card affects your net worth equivalently to investing in a risk-free asset with an after-tax return equal to the credit card's interest rate. Note the use of ''after-tax'' and ''risk-free'', as those are important considerations.

== Loan considerations ==
Be certain of your loan's payment terms and conditions. You may not be entitled to skip payments, or the interest due may not be what you expect. Read the contract. In addition, check your tax records to see whether you are actually deducting the loan interest; many homeowners take the standard deduction and thus get no tax deduction from the interest payment.

=== Calculating interest ===
Because there are several ways of calculating interest on loans (including how leap year is considered), the exact details may differ by small amounts. Bank and auto finance loans are probably very similar, but may not be identical.&lt;ref name="BH"&gt;{{forum link| t=87988| title=Paying loans early - differences between types of loans| author=dm200| date=January 1, 2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

As an example, take a $10,000.00 credit union loan at 6.00% interest rate for 48 months issued January 15, with the first payment due on February 15, and then on the 15th of succeeding months. The monthly payment would be $234.86 per month for 47 payments and a final payment of $234.71 and an approximate total interest of $1,273.13. The exact amount of interest depends on the exact amount paid and which day the payment is credited. Such consumer loans charge interest on the number of days and the outstanding balance each day.

On this loan, suppose you paid the $234.86 on the 10th of every month (five days early). Because this would slightly reduce the balance each month on the principal, overall interest would be less, resulting in a final (48th) payment of 224.31 - a savings of about $10.

As another example, suppose you chose to pay a little extra each month on the 15th. Say you paid $250.00 each month on the 15th. You would then pay off the loan with 44 payments of $250.00 and a 45th and final payment of $185.43. Total interest would be $1,185.43.

=== Loan prepayment ===
If you pay extra, do you still need to make the full monthly payment the next month? If you read all the fine print in the loan agreement, almost certainly the full payment is required each month. However, most credit unions - to some degree - allow paying early or extra to then allow skipping a month's payment. So, for example, if you make three payments in July, can you then skip August, September and October? Maybe or maybe not - all depends on the policies and practices of that credit union. Some credit unions will allow one, two or three months prepayment where you can then skip.&lt;ref name="BH" /&gt;

While mortgage loans could operate the same way, almost none do. Mortgages operate with somewhat different rules, practices and customs. Mortgages are almost always sold by the issuing credit union (or bank) or, if not actually sold, structured in a way where they could be sold. In almost all cases, interest is collected based on the amortization schedule - not actual days. So, for example, my mortgage payment is due the 1st of the month. BUT - whether I pay my January 1 due payment on December 25 (early) or January 10 (late, but within the grace period) - the interest paid is the same. For mortgages, if you want to pay extra to save interest, that must be specifically identified and credited according to the rules of the lender/servicer. When you pay extra and/or early to save interest, you still owe the full payment in succeeding months. One reason for mortgage loans being treated like this is that it better allows transfers and sale of mortgages from one institution to another that have very different data processing and crediting systems in place.

==Non-mathematical considerations==

=== Peace of mind ===
For many investors, the peace of mind from not having a loan is valuable. If you are in that situation, it may be worth paying off a loan at a small additional cost so that the loan will be gone. 

=== Simplicity ===

Once a loan is paid off, your life is simplified. The money budgeted for this loan can now be used elsewhere, such as investing.

===Liquidity===
If you use money to pay off a loan and then need money later, you cannot get it back without taking a new loan, probably at a higher interest rate (such as a home-equity loan rather than a first mortgage). Therefore, it is best to build a significant [[Emergency fund | emergency fund]] before paying down a mortgage, and not to use money for paying down the mortgage that you might need to spend on something else other than buying a new house. (However, if you add money to your [[Traditional IRA]] or [[401(k)]] rather than paying down the mortgage, you do not normally gain any liquidity advantage, since you generally cannot withdraw from the Traditional IRA or 401(k) without a penalty until you reach the appropriate age.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Withdrawals from a Traditional IRA will be subject to income tax. Early withdrawals are generally amounts distributed from your Traditional IRA account before you are age 59 1/2. You must pay a 10% additional tax on the distribution of any assets from your Traditional IRA before you are age 59 1/2.

:'''Exceptions to the penalty apply if the early withdrawal is:'''
:* made to a beneficiary or estate on account of the IRA owner's death,
:* made on account of disability,
:* made as part of a series of [[SEPP:Substantially_Equal_Periodic_Payments|substantially equal periodic payments]] over your life or life expectancy,
:* made to pay for a qualified first–time home purchase,
:* not above your qualified higher education expenses,
:* not above certain medical insurance premiums paid while unemployed,
:* not above your unreimbursed medical expenses that are more than a certain percentage of your adjusted gross income, or
:* due to an IRS levy.

For a Roth IRA, withdrawals of contributions can be withdrawn tax free, under the [[Roth IRA#Distributions |ordering rules]]. If the Roth IRA has passed the five year holding requirement, withdrawals of qualified earnings will be tax free for the following exceptions:
:* you become disabled, distributions attributable to your disability,
:* qualified first-time homebuyer distributions,
:* made to a beneficiary or estate on account of the IRA owner's death.

Penalty free and/or tax free early withdrawals from IRAs cannot be reinvested back into the IRA.
&lt;/ref&gt;)

To preserve liquidity, you might create a dedicated "loan payment" fund, invested in [[Municipal bonds |municipal]] or [[Treasury bonds|treasury]] bonds which always has enough money for you to pay down the loan.

=== Discipline ===

It requires financial discipline to direct money to savings, investment, or early loan payments instead of fun things.

Once you pay off the loan, if you redirect the freed-up loan payment cash flow to increased consumption, you will have no additional savings in the end.

=== Special considerations ===

If you have a student loan and might work for an employer which will forgive the loan (such as a federal or state government), do not pay it down early unless the rate is very high, as you will forfeit that benefit.

In addition, there are estate-planning considerations when deciding whether to pay off a loan. For example, credit cards are typically subject to collection after death, and yet federal student loans are discharged after death. As such, if you are planning an estate, it might not be useful to use assets to pay off federal student loans, as they would be discharged upon death (and ''not'' considered cancellation nor issued a 1099-C), and you would be better off investing those assets.

== Prerequisites ==

Before deciding to pay extra to retire debt early you should make sure you understand your financial situation. Is your [[Household budgeting|household budget]] in order? Do you have an [[emergency fund]] established, and enough extra cash flow to make a difference in your loans?

==Guidelines for making the choice==
Usually, you should pay down the loan if the after-tax interest rate on the loan is significantly higher than the after-tax rate you can earn on a comparable bond investment (a low-risk bond investment with duration equal to the time until you will pay off the loan), and you can pay the loan down without any liquidity problems.

Here is the most likely order of priority for investments versus paying off loans; it does depend on the rates, so these examples are based on typical rates which may not be accurate at any specific time.

*Invest in 401(k) to get maximum employer match (rate may be over 100% in the first year)
*Pay down credit cards (rate 10-30+%)
*Pay down non-deductible auto or student loans, or other medium-rate loans (rate 5-8%)
*Invest in [[Roth IRA]], deductible IRA or decent 401(k) (rate 5% on Treasury bonds)
*Pay down deductible mortgage or student loans (rate 4% after tax)
*Invest in taxable account (rate 4% on municipal bonds)
*Do not pay down subsidized loans as long as subsidy lasts (rate 0-3%)

===Why use bond returns for comparison?===
While you may have a higher expected return by investing in stocks, or in a mixed stock/bond allocation, rather than in bonds, that return comes with a higher risk. Unless your investments are 100% in stocks, you can choose to take a higher risk whether or not you pay down your loan, because you can sell bonds and buy stock. Therefore, a fair comparison is between paying down the loan and a bond investment with the same risk. 

One way to look at the comparison is to consider the following choices.

# Invest the money with your preferred allocation.
# Invest the money in bonds.
# Pay down the loan and move an equal amount of money from bonds to your preferred allocation.
# Pay down the loan and leave the investments unchanged.

The choice between 3 and 4, while difficult, is one you have already made; you decided how much risk you were willing to take, and chose your stock/bond allocation. And the choice between 1 and 3, or between 2 and 4, is much simpler; if you pay a higher interest rate on the loan than you would by investing in bonds, you will come out ahead by paying down the loan. If you prefer 3 to 1 (higher rate on the loan), then you prefer 4 to 1 also and should pay down the loan. If you prefer 2 to 4 (higher rate on bonds), then you should invest the money according to whichever of 1 or 2 you prefer.

===What type of bonds are comparable?===
Paying down a fixed-rate loan gives you a guaranteed, zero-risk return, since it reduces an existing liability. Therefore, it should be compared to a bond with no credit risk. If you would be investing the money in an IRA or 401(k), the best comparison is a Treasury bond; if you would be investing in a taxable account, the best comparison is a high-quality municipal bond, which has almost no risk and usually has better after-tax returns. 
Note that you are generally best off putting stocks in your taxable account and bonds in tax-deferred accounts -- see [[Principles of tax-efficient fund placement]] for more information.

If your loan is at a fixed rate, the proper comparison is to a bond with duration equal to the time it will take you to pay off the loan, because that is how long it will take you to realize the benefit. For example, if you pay an extra $1,000 on your 6% mortgage, the reduced mortgage balance will decrease by 6% a year, compounded annually (but all the gains are taxable). If there are ten years left on your mortgage, you will reduce your final payment by $1,791, so your prepayment is effectively a ten-year bond. If there are more than ten years left but you sell the house in ten years, you will get an extra $1,791 after the loan is paid off, so it is again a ten-year bond.

If your loan is at a variable rate, the proper comparison is to a short-term bond even if it will take you a long time to pay off the loan, because you will be effectively reinvesting your savings every year at rates tied to short-term rates. For example, if your mortgage rate is 1% above the one-year Treasury bill rate, and you pay off the mortgage in ten years, your pre-tax gain will be 10.5% more than the rate of one-year Treasury bills reinvested for ten years because of compounding, no matter what happens to Treasury rates during the next ten years.

While paying down the loan gives a zero-risk return, you will still face risk from the potential change in value of an asset (such as a house) you purchased with the proceeds of the loan -- but that risk would still exist if you had purchased the asset with cash.

===What is the effective rate?===
If your loan interest is tax-deductible, the after-tax rate to use for comparison is the actual rate, reduced by a percentage equal to your tax bracket. For example, if your mortgage is at 6% and you are in a 30% tax bracket, the after-tax rate is 4.2% = 6% - (30% &amp;times; 6%); paying down $10,000 and reducing the interest by $600 would increase your tax bill by $180. (Even if you would lose the opportunity to itemize deductions if you paid off the whole loan, treat any partial payment as a fully taxable investment, because you have to eliminate the deductible interest first before you can pay off enough to eliminate non-deductible interest.)

As another example, the first $2,500 you pay in interest on a student loan is tax-deductible up to a certain income level. Suppose you have a $60,000 student loan at 5% interest, so that you will owe $3,000 of interest next year; you deduct $2,500 of interest, reducing your tax bill by $375 if you are in a 15% tax bracket ($375 = ($3,000 &amp;times; 15%) - ($3,000 - $2,500) &amp;times; 15%). If you pay down $10,000, you reduce the interest to $2,500, and you still get the full deduction, so your benefit is the full $500 for an effective rate of 5%. But if you pay down yet another $10,000, you reduce the interest to $2000, and you lose a $500 deduction, increasing your tax bill by $75. Thus, the second $10,000 payment earns you only $425, for an effective rate of 4.25% on this payment.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The ''effective rate'' is the annual rate of interest when compounding occurs more than once per year. See: [http://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/effectiveinterest.asp Effective Annual Interest Rate], from Investopedia.&lt;/ref&gt;

===If the decision is close===
If, by the sheer numbers, the decision is close, it may be better to keep the loan.&lt;ref name="Close Decision"&gt;{{forum link| t=113520| title=Decision on wiki: Paying Loans vs. Investing| author=assumer| date=March 26, 2013}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The benefits of paying off the loan would be:
* [[Paying_down_loans_versus_investing#Peace_of_Mind|Psychological benefits]]
* Reduced minimum monthly payments, which could be useful in an emergency situation.
* Tax-free return.

The benefits of keeping the loan and investing in bonds would be:
* [[Paying_down_loans_versus_investing#Liquidity|Liquidity]] (you can likely choose to sell the bonds and pay the loan off at any time)
* If interest rates fall, you can likely refinance the loan at a lower rate.
* Fixed-rate loans (for example, mortgages) can offer inflation protection (if inflation rises, you are still only paying the same nominal amount per month).
* If the choice is between investing in tax-advantage accounts (for example, a 401(k) or IRA) and paying down the loan, investing in the 401(k) or IRA will give you more tax-deferred investments, which will remain valuable even after you have paid off the loan, and these accounts have annual contribution limits.

In the investment world, the term '''glide path''' refers to the process by which a target date fund changes its [[Asset allocation|asset allocation]] among risky assets (which can include [[Stock basics | stocks]], [[Domestic/International | international stocks]], [[Real estate investment trust |REITs]] and [[Commodities | commodities]]) and lower risk assets such as  [[Bond basics | bonds]], [[Treasury Inflation Protected Securities | inflation indexed bonds]] and [[Money markets | money market funds]] over a time horizon. Target date funds include [[Target Retirement Funds | target retirement funds]] in the retirement plan market, as well as [[529 plans#529 Plan Investment Programs | age-adjusted portfolios]] in the college savings plan market. The glide path of a target fund shifts from high risky equity allocations at inception to ever higher fixed income investments as the target date approaches.

==Target retirement funds glide paths==

Target retirement funds almost universally begin with high equity allocations for young investors. However each fund group establishes a glide path for its series of target funds, and these glide paths vary considerably. In general, however, a fund's glide path will follow one of three methods: straight line, stepped, or rolldown.

:1. '''Straight Line''':  A straight line glide path takes a steady, linear approach that gradually reduces the equity weighting of the portfolio over time. [[The Vanguard Group |Vanguard]] and [[TIAA-CREF]] take this approach.&lt;ref&gt;Vanguard outlines their approach and reasoning to glide paths [https://personal.vanguard.com/pdf/icrtdf.pdf Vanguard’s approach to target-date funds] &lt;/ref&gt;

|}   &lt;!-- end of table --&gt;


:2. '''Stepped''':  With a stepped glide path the equity allocation is held steady until periodically adjusted. ING takes this approach. In their stepped glide path, during the first three decades the adjustment is made every ten years; subsequent adjustments are made in five year intervals.

|}   &lt;!-- end of table --&gt;


:3. '''Rolldown''': This glide path method holds high levels of equity allocations until approximately twenty years before the retirement date, when a sharp reduction in the equity allocation begins, extending through the decumulation stage. [[Fidelity]] takes this approach.&lt;ref&gt; [http://corporate.morningstar.com/US/documents/MethodologyDocuments/ResearchPapers/TargetDateFundSeries_IndustrySurvey.pdf Target-Date Series Research Paper: 2009 Industry Survey,] p.10&lt;/ref&gt;

Target retirement fund managers justify high equity allocations for young investors on the grounds that a long time horizon allows the investor plenty of time to recover from the down cycles of markets and  that the large amount of human capital (future lifetime earnings)  the young investor possesses provides the investor ample opportunities for increasing the personal savings rate when the markets decline. In the meantime the investor can garner a greater percentage of the expected equity return premium over an investment career by holding the higher equity allocation. While a target date's glide path will slowly reduce the equity allocation over the lifetime of the investor, target date funds ordinarily hold a considerable allocation to equity investments as an investor approaches retirement age. These allocations are attributable to the fact that most target retirement funds are designed to be held through the planned retirement date and held over the entire period of the investor's retirement phase. Firms with high post retirement  equity allocations base their asset allocation decision on the expected increased longevity of post retirement accounts. The lengthened time horizon allows time for recovery from market down cycles during the early stage of retirement, and, assuming a realization of an expected equity return premium, the portfolio will have a higher value to help mitigate the risk of having reduced income at the end of a long life.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www2.troweprice.com/rms/rps/Sponsors/DefaultContent/StaticAssets/Revisiting_TRP_Asset_Alloc_GP_Strategy.pdf Revisiting T. Rowe Price’s Asset Allocation Glide-Path Strategy]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The dispersion of equity allocations in the universe of target retirement funds is a narrow 2.5% in the 2055 series of target date funds. This dispersion of equity allocations widens to 40%-50% as the target series approaches the retirement years. For example, the range of equity allocation in 2010 target date funds falls between a low 26% allocation in the Wells Fargo Advantage 2010 fund and a high 72% allocation in the Alliance Bernstein 2010 fund. Figure 4. illustrates the diversity of glide path allocations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://corporate.morningstar.com/US/documents/MethodologyDocuments/ResearchPapers/TargetDateFundSeries_IndustrySurvey.pdf Target-Date Series Research Paper: 2009 Industry Survey,] pp.7-8&lt;/ref&gt;

The divergence in asset allocation resulted in a wide dispersion of returns in the 2008 market collapse. Losses in the 2010 target fund series ranged from -9% to -41%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://advisor.morningstar.com/articles/article.asp?s=0&amp;docId=17632&amp;pgNo=1 Five Concerns About Target-Date Funds], John Rackenthaler, Morningstar Advisor, 10-31-2009 &lt;/ref&gt; Clearly, two funds bearing the same target date can have markedly different portfolio allocations, risk exposures, and returns. These performance disparities have drawn the attention of the SEC&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.sec.gov/news/press/2009/2009-138.htm SEC, DOL Announce Panelists, Agenda for Joint Hearing on Target Date Funds]&lt;/ref&gt; and the Congress.&lt;ref&gt; [http://aging.senate.gov/hearing_detail.cfm?id=319426&amp; Default Nation: Are 401(k) Target Date Funds Missing The Mark?]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Target retirement fund indexes==
[[File:Morningstarglidepaths.png|thumb|right|451px]]
Index providers Dow Jones, Standard &amp; Poor's, and Morningstar have developed indexes for benchmarking target retirement fund portfolios.  Dow Jones and Morningstar employ risk based metrics in devising the index glide path.  S&amp;P attempts to mirror the glide paths used by the actual target funds comprising the market.The Index glide path methodologies are outlined below:

:*'''Dow Jones Target Date Indexes ''': Glide path follows a monthly equity risk exposure reduction formula, from 90% to 20% of the total equity risk.&lt;ref name="Methodologies"&gt;[http://corporate.morningstar.com/us/documents/Indexes/TargetDateIndexComparison.pdf Target Date Index Comparison Grid]&lt;/ref&gt;
:*'''S&amp;P Target Date Indexes''': Glide path is a scrubbed average of nearly all active Target Date fund equity allocations – consensus glide path is the objective.&lt;ref name="Methodologies"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
:*'''Morningstar Target Date Indexes''': Modern Portfolio Theory-based asset allocation, optimized to human capital asset assumptions. Liability-driven investment (LDI) approach using investor balance sheet construct for surplus optimization. Indexes are provided for three risk profiles: conservative, moderate, and aggressive.&lt;ref name="Methodologies"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

The following table provides the Index equity targets for selective ages: a youthful starting date; a date ten years prior to a common retirement date; a common retirement age; and a date five years after retirement. The glide paths of the seven largest mutual fund managers is also provided in the table. The benchmark indexes can help investors gauge the relative riskiness of a given target retirement fund's guide path strategy.

==College savings plans glide paths==
The time horizon for a child's college savings is bounded by the assumed ages of college enrollment (18-22). The glide paths of 529 Savings Plan age-adjusted portfolios are therefore usually much more conservative than those used in the retirement plan market. Many plans transition portfolios to hold 100% cash or 100% cash/fixed income portfolios at age 18+. However, as in the retirement plan market, there is a wide variance in the range of stock allocations for the 18-22 age period. Many 529 savings plans offer risk-based portfolios (Conservative, Moderate, and Aggressive) and the equity allocations for the 18+ age group in many aggressive portfolios range from 10% equity to 65% equity.&lt;ref name="study"&gt;[http://www.savingforcollege.com/articles/savingforcollegecoms-age-based-allocation-study-nov-2008 Savingforcollege.com’s age-based allocation study (Nov 2008)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The following table shows the glide path allocations for the three largest 529 Plan vendors in the direct market 529 plan universe, Vanguard, TIAA-CREF, and Fidelity. The allocations are provided for equity investments, fixed income investments, and money market fund investments.

{{Notice | The Vanguard table entries will be outdated as of October 30, 2020 -- Vanguard has announced  [https://www.vanguard.com/pdf/529rogp.pdf plans to transition to a target-enrollment approach].}}

Many Vanguard 529 plans follow the glide path illustrated in the table. However some states (Illinois and Indiana) hold a 10% equity allocation in the 18+ age band. Iowa, Missouri, Nebraska, and North Carolina supply a 20% equity allocation in the aggressive allocation portfolios. Utah's option 3, the most aggressive allocation in that state's plan, holds a 65% equity allocation at age 18.&lt;ref name="study"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Individual retirement portfolios and glide paths==

As mentioned  in [[Withdrawal methods#Constant-dollar (age in bonds)|bond percentage equal to your age]], many people prefer not to keep a static stock/bond allocation throughout their retirement, but to gradually have their portfolio become more conservative by reducing the stock allocation and increasing the bond allocation as they age. However, the rule-of-thumb method where your bond percentage is equal to your age is sometimes seen as a bit too conservative. Another method, similar to the allocations used by some retirement-date funds is to follow a ''glide-path'' allocation change that isn't necessarily directly linear, as is the bonds=age method. Often, a glide-path method will add bonds to the portfolio mix more slowly in the early years before retirement, thus allowing the portfolio more possibility for growth before retirement. Then, after retirement, the glide-path may transition more quickly to a bond-heavy allocation, thus shielding the portfolio from stock market volatility during later retirement years.
Figure 4 shows a graph comparing the ''(100-age)'' stock allocation and the ''Log(100-age)-1'' glide-path allocation. The blue (100-age) line is linear, changing the allocation by 1% each year. The glide-path allocation changes more slowly in the earlier years, presumably allowing for more portfolio growth during the accumulation years, and then turns quicker towards a more conservative allocation during the retirement years, eventually becoming more conservative and following a 100% bond allocation for age 90 and later.

|}   &lt;!-- end of table --&gt;

As with the similar [[Withdrawal methods##Constant-dollar (age in bonds)|''bond percentage equal to your age'']] method, following a glide-path stock/bond allocation allows the overall portfolio to become more conservative each year. The results, shown in Figure 6, are similar to the ''bonds equal age ''method, but in the time-period shown in the graph, the slower transition to bonds allowed the overall portfolio to grow a bit more, resulting in slightly more money being withdrawn from the portfolio, while retaining a similar volatility.

The following outline is provided as a topical overview of personal retirement plans:

'''Personal retirement plans''' include Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRA)s, annuities, and some forms of charitable split-interest gifts.

==IRA accounts==
An individual retirement arrangement, or IRA, is a personal savings plan which allows you to set aside money for retirement, while offering you tax advantages. You may be able to deduct some or all of your contributions to your IRA. Amounts in your IRA, including earnings, generally are not taxed until distributed to you. IRAs cannot be owned jointly. However, any amounts remaining in your IRA upon your death can be paid to your beneficiary or beneficiaries.

==Annuities==
 
===Deferred annuities===
Deferred annuities are used to accumulate assets. Funds will grow at a rate that can be either fixed or variable.

*'''Fixed annuity''': The money you put in a fixed annuity earns interest at a rate that is guaranteed for a specific period of time—ranging from one to five years or more, depending on the terms of the contract. When that period ends, a new rate may take effect—or the old rate may be offered again.
*'''Variable annuity''': With a variable annuity, your money is put in subaccount investments that are similar to stock and bond funds. The return on your investments is subject to the risk of market fluctuation. Your total account value depends on how much risk you take, the performance of the subaccounts, and what charges and fees are deducted.
An Equity-indexed annuity, also referred to as a fixed indexed annuity, is a type of fixed annuity where earnings accumulate at a rate based on a formula linked in part to a published equity-based index, such as the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500 Composite Stock Price IndexTM (S&amp;P 500). An indexed annuity provides a guarantee of a minimum accumulation value, and may also offer death benefit protection and a variety of payout options. The index used, the formula that determines the indexed rate and the guaranteed minimum value, can vary from insurer to insurer.
* [[Equity-indexed annuity]]
* [[Fixed annuity]]
* [[Variable annuity]]

===Immediate annuities===
Immediate (Income) annuities are used to convert a lump sum into an income stream (regular payments), typically for the life of the annuitant. If the income stream is fixed, it is considered a fixed immediate annuity; also known as a Single Premium Immediate Annuity (SPIA). Some fixed immediate annuities are offered with inflation-adjusted payments or graded payments that rise at a fixed rate, of for example, 3% annually. However, these options reduce the initial payment received but with the anticipation that payments will grow steadily over time. If the income stream is variable, it is considered a variable immediate annuity. Like deferred variable annuities, your money is put into subaccounts. These subaccounts can be invested in stock or bond funds. Payments will fluctuate based on the underlying subaccounts. With funds invested in stocks, it is possible that payments could grow at a rate higher than can be achieved by fixed immediate annuities.

* [[Immediate variable annuity]]

==Charitable split interest plans== 

A split-interest gift is any gift in which a portion is assigned to charity and a portion benefits the donor or their designee. Charitable gift annuities, pooled income funds, and charitable remainder trusts are all varieties of split-interest gifts.

A '''bond''' is a debt investment. Investors loan money to corporations or governments for a set term and interest rate. After they have been issued, bonds trade on the over-the-counter market, where their principal value fluctuates according to changes in interest rates and any changes in the bond's credit quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.investinginbonds.com/learnmore.asp?catid=3&amp;id=383| publisher=Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association| title=Risks of Investing in Bonds| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220331004748/https://www.investinginbonds.com/learnmore.asp?catid=3&amp;id=383| archive-date=March 31, 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newly issued [[Corporate bonds | corporate bonds]] are syndicated by investment banks who initially buy an offering for resale to investors. Government bonds are offered by auction, where investors tender bids for the issue.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikipedia:Bond (finance)| Bond (finance)]], from Wikipedia&lt;/ref&gt; Investors typically use bonds to stabilize the value of a portfolio, or to produce a stream of income, or both.

For a very basic introduction to stocks, start with the [[#Tutorial | tutorial]] at the bottom of this page.

==Features==

[[File:Bonddiagram.gif|frame|400px|right| Advanced Bond Concepts:Bond Type Specifics, Investopedia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/022516/understanding-different-types-bond-yields.asp| title=Understanding the Different Types of Bond Yields| publisher=Investopedia| date=September 30, 2022| accessdate=August 13, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Bonds have some distinctive features. These include:
*'''Coupon rate''': the interest rate paid by the bond. The rate may be fixed, floating, or inflation indexed, depending on the specific issue. The coupon date gives the frequency of interest payments, usually biannually for US bonds. Bonds which pay a fixed coupon rate based upon the principal (face amount) are called [[Nominal bond |''nominal'' bonds]].
*'''Maturity date''': the date at which the bond principal will be repaid. Bonds are usually issued with maturities [[Money markets | ranging from 1 year]] to thirty years.
*'''Options''': the most common option involving bonds is a '''call feature'''. This gives the issuer the right to repay the bond before the maturity date. Because an issuer will call bonds when the interest rate is lower than the coupon rate, it is not advantageous to the buyer of the bond, who must then reinvest the proceeds of the redeemed bond in a lower interest rate environment. Because of this, a callable bond usually offers a higher coupon than an uncallable bond, to compensate for the risk of early redemption. Some callable bonds also add a small sum to the par value of a redeemed bond. Alternatively, some bonds are issued with a '''put feature''' which gives the bond holder the right to force the issuer to repay the bond before the maturity date, usually on predefined put dates.
*'''Sinking funds''' provide a means of repaying a bond issue. The issuer makes periodic payments to a trustee who retires part of the issue by purchasing the bonds in the open market. Sinking funds tend to reduce the risk of default, which lets the issuer of a bond to pay a lower interest rate on the bond. 
*'''Senior debt''' and '''Subordinated debt''': [[Wikipedia:Senior debt|Senior debt]] has priority over other debt in case of default; [[Wikipedia:Subordinated debt|Subordinated debt]] is unsecured and, in a default, is [[Wikipedia:Bond (finance)| repayable]] after other debts have been paid.

==Types of bonds==

There are three main issuers of bonds in the U.S.: the Treasury; corporations; and municipalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Annette Thau| title=The Bond Book| publisher=McGraw-Hill| date=2001| pages=29-36| isbn=0-07-135862-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Treasury bonds===
'''[[Treasury Bonds]]''' are issued by the US treasury in groups of three maturity ranges
*Bills have a range up to one year;
*Notes have a range between one year and ten years;
*Bonds have a range greater than ten years. 

Treasury bonds are usually not callable. Treasuries also carry the full faith and credit backing of the U.S. government. The interest income is exempt from state tax. You can purchase Treasuries through brokerages and banks as well as through an individual account at [https://www.treasurydirect.gov/marketable-securities/treasury-bills/ Treasury Direct]. Government agencies also issue debt, some of which is backed by the full faith and credit of the government, and some which is not.

'''[[Treasury Inflation Protected Securities]]''' (TIPS) give you both inflation indexed income and inflation protection for the bond's principal. The bond pays a fixed real interest rate based on a principal value indexed to the CPI-U inflation measure. Like all treasury bonds, inflation indexed treasuries have the "full faith and credit" backing of the Treasury and interest income and inflation adjusted accruals are exempt from state taxation. However, you must pay federal tax annually on the inflation adjusted accruals. This tax on "phantom income" means that you should try to hold these bonds in tax-advantaged accounts.

===Corporate bonds===
'''[[Corporate bonds]]''' are issued by corporations and are often callable. Because a corporation can default on its debts, corporate bonds have credit risk, and so usually pay higher coupon interest rates over comparable term treasury maturities as compensation for this risk. Corporate bonds are taxable, both for federal and for state income tax. 

===Municipal bonds===
'''[[Municipal bonds]]''' are issued by states and localities. These bonds have credit risk. Many municipal bonds are also callable. The bonds are generally exempt from federal tax, although some private revenue municipal bonds are subject to the federal alternative minimum tax. A tax exempt bond is also usually state tax exempt for residents of the state issuing the bond. Because of these tax preferences, municipal bonds usually offer lower coupon interest rates than do comparable term treasuries and corporate bonds. 

===Other types of bonds===

====Zero-coupon bonds====
'''[[Zero-coupon bond |Zero Coupon bonds]]''' are accrual bonds and do not pay current coupon interest. They are issued at a deep discount from par value and compound continuously at the coupon rate. Holders receive the full principal amount as well as the value that has accrued from interest on the redemption date. Financial institutions can create zero coupon bonds from fixed rate bonds by "stripping off" the coupons. In other words, the coupons and the final principal payment of the bond are separate, and trade independently. Holders pay tax on the annual accrual of income, although they receive no current interest payment.

====Asset-backed securities====
'''[[Asset-backed securities]]''' are bonds whose interest and principal payments are backed by underlying cash flows from other assets. Examples of asset-backed securities are [[Mortgage-backed security|mortgage-backed securities]] (MBSs), which include GNMA securities backed by the full faith and credit of the US treasury, collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs) and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), whose underlying securities are often assets such as auto loans or credit card receivables.

====High yield bonds====
'''[[High yield bonds]]''' are corporate bonds with lower credit quality than top credits. These companies are at much greater risk of default than higher quality credits and, as a result, pay higher coupon interest rates than comparable high quality corporate bonds.

==Sources of return==

There are three sources of return for a bond:
# Return of principal
# Interest (coupon payments)
# Interest-on-interest (reinvested coupon payments)

According to [[Frank J. Fabozzi]] in the ''The Handbook of Fixed Income Securities'' (1991, page 97):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Frank J. Fabozzi| author-link=Frank J. Fabozzi| title=The Handbook of Fixed Income Securities| date=2005| publisher=McGraw-Hill| isbn=978-0071440998}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{blockquote|In high interest rate environments, the interest-on-interest component for long-term bonds may be as high as 70 percent of the bond's potential total dollar return.}}
In low interest rate environments, the principal is likely the largest source of value of all but the longest bonds. The figure below illustrates the three sources of bond return:

[[File:Sources_of_bond_return.png|800px]]

==Risks==

Each of the following risks of bonds carries some premium as compensation for bearing these risks. The amount of that premium varies according to the market's assessment of the likelihood of the adverse event occurring.

===Interest rate risk===

Interest rate risk, also called price risk, is that the value of a bond fluctuates depending on the interest rate. Also known as "market risk." The amount of interest rate risk assumed is measured primarily by the [[Bonds: advanced topics#Duration | duration]], and secondarily by [[Bonds: advanced topics#Convexity | convexity]]. See [[#Bonds on the secondary_market | below]] for more information on how bond prices react to interest rate changes.

Interest rate risk is in some sense an artifact of the traditional framework which looks at short-term returns. Over longer periods, longer duration bonds will have a more certain return than short-term bonds, as a quote from John Campbell and Luis Viceira's academic text, ''Strategic Asset Allocation'' (pages 86-87), makes clear:
{{blockquote|If one uses conventional mean-variance analysis, it is hard to explain why any investors hold large positions in bonds. Mean-variance analysis treats cash as the riskless asset and bonds as merely another risky asset like stocks. Bonds are valued only for their potential contribution to the short-run excess return, relative to risk, of a diversified risky portfolio. ... A long-horizon analysis treats bonds very differently, and assigns them a much more important role in the optimal portfolio. For long-term investors, money market investments are not riskless because they must be rolled over at uncertain future interest rates.}}

Because unexpected inflation changes that picture somewhat, the reduced risk of longer-term bonds is primarily true when discussing inflation-protected bonds in real dollars (or nominal bonds with nominal liabilities).

===Credit risk===

Credit risk is a risk that the issuer of a bond may default. Also known as "default risk." 

The major ratings agencies (Moody's, S&amp;P, and Fitch) assess credit risk.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Moody's Investors Service, Fitch, and Standard &amp; Poor's Ratings Services are three of several credit rating agencies the SEC categorizes as a [http://www.sec.gov/answers/nrsro.htm Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (NRSRO)]. The SEC's Office of Credit Ratings maintains a list here: [http://www.sec.gov/ocr/ratingagency.html Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations ("NRSROs")]&lt;/ref&gt; Each [[#Credit ratings | credit rating]] has an expected rate of default, which increases substantially in lower tiers. For a given credit rating, the default rate has historically been lower for municipal bonds than for corporate bonds. Wikipedia has [[wikipedia:Bond credit rating | tables]]] of how the ratings compare between ratings firms and of historical default rates.

===Call risk===

Call risk is a risk that the issuer may call the bond, terminating a stream of income for investors. This risk is often called prepayment risk for [[Mortgage Backed Securities | mortgage backed securities]]. Call options embedded in a bond lead to negative [[convexity]].

===Reinvestment risk===

Reinvestment risk is a risk that when a bond matures or is called, an investor may have to reinvest the proceeds in a bond yielding a lower interest.

===Inflation risk===

Inflation risk is a risk that the interest from a bond may not keep up with inflation. [[Treasury_Inflation_Protected_Securities|TIPS]] are inflation-adjusted and therefore largely immune to inflation risk. Also known as "purchasing power risk."

===Liquidity risk===

Liquidity risk is the risk that you may not be able to extract the remaining value from your bond in the timeframe needed without losing a disproportionate amount of value. Thinly-traded issues (such as most corporate, municipal, and TIPS issues) have liquidity risk. The liquidity premium is expected to rise in times of crisis. Also known as "marketability risk."

Liquidity risk can be seen most clearly in "off-the-run" Treasury bonds, where an older but otherwise identical bond trades at a reduced price (or higher yield) simply because it is less liquid.

=== Other risks ===

These risks are either not important for individual investors or are generally wrapped into the risks above (for example, credit risk commonly encompasses event risk). They are included here for completeness.

* '''Yield curve or maturity risk''': Generally only important in hedging situations.
* '''Exchange rate or currency risk''': Only relevant for non-dollar-denominated bonds. [[John Bogle]] does not recommend these.
* '''Volatility risk''': Volatility affects bonds with embedded options (commonly a corporate bond with a call option), because an option's value depends on volatility. If the price of an issue is highly volatile, the likelihood of a random fluctuation straying above the strike price is much greater.
* '''Political or legal risk''': Tax-code changes and regulatory decisions can all affect the value of a bond. 
* '''Event risk''': A type of credit risk which affects many firms due to a single event (and therefore event risk cannot be fully diversified away).
* '''Sector risk''': A type of credit risk which affects all or many firms in a single sector.

==Credit ratings==

Three major ratings agencies assess the likelihood of a bond defaulting and assign that bond ratings according to a standardized scale.

For a given credit rating, the default rate has historically been lower for municipal bonds than for corporate bonds.

==Factors affecting bond prices==
{{main|Bond pricing}}
See [[Bond pricing]] for definitions of bond pricing terminology. (This is an advanced topic.)

===New issues===
Two major factors primarily set the coupon of a newly issued bond: the credit quality of the bond, and the maturity of the bond. Investors taking on higher risks expect higher return. Because of this, the US Treasury can pay a lower coupon on its debt than corporate borrowers, who are subject to default risk. Three credit rating agencies trade non treasury debt. The table above describes the ratings.

The longer the maturity of a bond, the greater the risk to the bondholder. Longer time horizons increase the likelihood that a bond issuer will become a greater credit risk through bad management decisions, the deterioration of economic conditions, or the company engaging in future merger and acquisition activity which changes the leverage of a company's balance sheet. Longer horizons also increase the likelihood that a bond's coupon income will be eroded by higher than expected inflation.

Finance economics defines a bond's expected return as comprising three basic building blocks:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author1=Elroy Dimson| author1-link=Elroy Dimson| author2=Paul R. Marsh| author3=Mike Staunton| title=Triumph of the Optimists: 101 Years of Global Investment Return| publisher=Princeton University Press| date=2002| pages=89-90| isbn=0-691-09194-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Default risk premium''': the risk-free rate as defined by the current yield of a treasury bill
* '''Time horizon premium''': a time horizon premium to compensate investors for the risks of longer maturities
* '''T-bill rate''': and a default risk premium to compensate investors for bearing credit risk.

===Bonds on the secondary market===

Once a bond is issued, it trades on the secondary market, and fluctuates in price until it matures. A bond will change in price for two main reasons:
* The bond's credit rating has changed (either upgraded or downgraded).
* Interest rates have changed.

Unless a bond is falling into or out of default, price movements associated with changes in credit rating are usually infrequent, although during periods of economic distress and economic recovery credit rating changes can be significant price factors. The ever present driver of changes in a bond's market value comes from fluctuations in current market interest rates.

An example can illustrate how bond pricing works. Suppose you purchase, at issue, a $1,000 ten year bond yielding a 5% coupon. This entitles you to $50 of annual income. Then, suppose that one year later, interest rates have risen to 6% and you wish to liquidate the bond. No rational investor will pay you $1,000 for $50 of income, when they can receive $60 annually for the same $1,000 dollar investment. In this scenario, your 5% bond will have to decrease in market value until its current yield approximately produces a 6% return.

A similar, yet opposite price movement occurs if interest rates fall. Suppose instead that interest rates fall to 4 percent during the year after your purchase. Your $1,000 bond produces $50 of annual income in an environment where investors can only receive $40 of annual income from a newly issued bond. Your bond will therefore rise in price until it provides a purchaser with a 4% return.

This is the basic rule of bond price movements in the open market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Annette Thau| title=The Bond Book| publisher=McGraw-Hill| date=2001| page=30| isbn=0-07-135862-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{| class=wikitable style="text-align:center" width=400px

| align="center" style="background:#f0f0f0;"|'''Then'''
|-
| interest rates rise||bond prices fall
|-
| interest rates fall||bond prices rise
|}

To calculate how much prices will rise or fall, please see [[Bonds:_Advanced_Topics#Duration | Duration]].

A corollary to this is that, all other things being equal, price fluctuations are greater for long maturities than for shorter maturities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Annette Thau| title=The Bond Book| publisher=McGraw-Hill| date=2001| page=73| isbn=0-07-135862-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; At any given time in the secondary market you are likely to find any number of bonds selling at a discount over par value, or at a premium to par value.

==Role in a portfolio==
Investors typically use bonds to stabilize the value of a portfolio, or to produce a stream of income, or both. For more see [[Asking bond questions]] for tips on how to ask about bonds on the [http://www.bogleheads.org/forum/index.php Forum].

===Long- vs. short-term===

Boglehead and financial expert [[William Bernstein]] recommends limiting bond holdings to short-term funds,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=William Bernstein| date=December 30, 2009| url=https://archive.nytimes.com/bucks.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/12/30/pascal-and-the-long-term-bond-dilemma/ |title=Pascal and the long-term bond dilemma| publisher=New York Times| accessdate=August 13, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; because of their relative immunity to the risk of unexpected inflation.

However, an article by Vanguard&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://personal.vanguard.com/us/insights/article/duration-diversification-052015| title=The long and short of finding bond balance| date=June 12, 2015| publisher=Vanguard| accessdate=March 21, 2016}}{{dead link}}&lt;/ref&gt; argues that when the yield curve is particularly steep, running to short-term bonds for safety can result in losses if the yield curve flattens.

A common recommendation of other experts is intermediate-term funds. Long-term bonds have historically returned no more than intermediate-term bonds, but with far greater volatility--in other words, their risk has not been rewarded. Yale endowment manager David Swensen recommends long-term Treasuries, however, as part of a portfolio dominated by equities, as they will provide the biggest counterweight to the collapse of other asset classes during a deflationary crisis.

Even proponents of short-term bonds such as Dr. Bernstein are comfortable with longer-term holdings in inflation-protected securities such as [[Treasury_Inflation_Protected_Securities | TIPS]], as they no longer carry any risk of unexpected inflation, leaving them vulnerable only to a real rate rise (which if held to the duration incurs only an opportunity cost).

While you should always keep the [[Bonds:_Advanced_Topics#Duration | duration]] less than or equal to your investment horizon, unless you have a specific funding need to be met at a specific date (in which case a [[Zero-coupon bond]] is the risk-free solution), you should choose between short-term and intermediate-term funds. The former is lower risk but the latter has historically given investors higher overall returns.

===Credit quality===

The ''[[Bogleheads' Guide To Investing]]'' authors recommend Vanguard's Total Bond Market, which contains investment-grade [[Corporate bonds |corporate bonds]]. [[John Bogle]] also recommends Total Bond Market, although he seems to prefer Vanguard's Intermediate-Term Index Fund for its lack of [[MBS]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| date=June 15, 2007| url=https://johncbogle.com/wordpress/2007/06/15/john-bogle-responds-to-ask-jack-questions-2/| title=John Bogle responds to "Ask Jack" questions| publisher= The Bogle Eblog}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, Boglehead and bond expert [[Larry Swedroe]] recommends only the very highest quality investments for bonds (and specifically recommends against Total Bond Market because of its negative [[Bonds:_Advanced_Topics#Convexity | convexity]]), citing evidence in which the risk of corporate bonds has not historically rewarded investors. Yale endowment manager David Swensen also recommends only Treasuries.

Finally, Boglehead and financial expert Rick Ferri advocates for not only the inclusion of investment-grade corporate bonds but also [[High yield bonds | high yield bonds]], on the basis of their diversification benefits.

Perhaps the best conclusion that can be drawn from the highly respected but conflicting advice is to:
* Ensure that your bond holdings are built around a core of Treasuries.
* If you choose to include corporate bonds, understand the risks you are taking (moderate in relation to stock investing but nevertheless quite real), and do not include too high a proportion. A good benchmark would be the market portfolio represented by Vanguard's Total Bond Market fund.
* If you choose to include high-yield bonds which incorporate considerable default and call risk, you take the funds from the equity portion of your asset allocation rather than the bond portion.

===Taxes===

Almost all of the return on a bond or bond fund comes from the dividend yield, which is fully taxed; in contrast, stocks get most of their return from price appreciation, which is not taxed until the stocks are sold and is taxed at the capital-gains tax rate. Therefore, when bond interest rates are relatively high, bonds are widely regarded as being [[Principles_of_Tax-Efficient_Fund_Placement | less tax-efficient than stock index funds]] (which rarely sell stock) and should be held in tax-deferred accounts when possible.

If you are in a high tax bracket and without sufficient taxable space, [[Municipal bonds]] are likely the preferred solution; these bonds are not taxed but there is a cost in lower yield. If you are in low tax brackets, you should calculate your after-tax return on taxable bonds in taxable accounts to determine whether or not to use municipal bonds.

==Style boxes==
"Style boxes" are 3&amp;nbsp;x&amp;nbsp;3 grids that categorize securities. Different investment styles have various levels of risk which leads to differences in returns. This visualization allows investors to compare securities using an easy-to-understand standardized format.

Fixed income funds (bonds) classify risk as levels of [[#Credit risk | credit risk]] (credit quality) on the vertical axis, and [[#Interest rate risk | interest rate risk]] (term risk) on the horizontal axis.

There are a number of ways to characterize interest rate risk, such as [[:Bonds: Advanced Topics#Duration | duration]] (sensitivity to changes in interest rates) and various maturity measures. In either case, the objective is to categorize interest rate risk into short-term, intermediate-term, and long-term periods of time.

Morningstar (interest rate sensitivity) and Vanguard (maturity) provide fixed income fund ''style boxes''. Either format can be used to compare funds, but compare using the same methodology. When comparing ''only'' Vanguard funds, Vanguard's style box is valid. Otherwise, if no Vanguard style box is available, use Morningstar's style box for all funds. Vanguard funds will be shown on Morningstar's site using the Morningstar style box.&lt;ref&gt;{{Forum link| p=948589| title=9-style box - Vanguard vs M*t}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stock Basics#Style Boxes | Equity style boxes]] (stock funds) and fixed income style boxes (bond funds) represent two-dimensional (horizontal and vertical axis) views of risk versus return. However, the background behind these boxes is based on very different concepts. '''Only compare stocks-to-stocks and bonds-to-bonds.'''

Both equity and fixed income style boxes are a way to visualize how diversified your portfolio is with respect to the main characteristic of each asset class - size and value for equities; credit risk and term risk for fixed income.&lt;ref&gt;{{Forum link| p=757434| title=Style boxes - Why the differences?

For example, you are interested in Vanguard's balanced funds&lt;ref&gt;[https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/tools/stylebox?View=Fund&amp;Cat=Domestic_Balanced_Balanced Vanguard balanced funds], Vanguard, style boxes&lt;/ref&gt; which contain both stock and bond funds.

      <text bytes="8557" sha1="cmi9x6gmi8lx1m5459dfxx9p8vs8f2x" xml:space="preserve">'''{{PAGENAME}}''' (TPAW) describes the "total portfolio" approach to asset allocation and withdrawal.

The total portfolio approach means that the present value of future savings and retirement income, valued using the safe bond rate, is counted as safe bonds in the portfolio. A fixed asset allocation is maintained on this "total portfolio." Retirement withdrawals are calculated by amortizing the total portfolio over retirement years ([[amortization based withdrawal]]).

The advantage of the total portfolio approach is that total risk is kept consistent from year to year. This has two benefits: 

# Risk is spread more evenly across years, reducing the total risk that the retiree would need to take to achieve a given expected return. 
# It prevents surprises like risk increasing unexpectedly as the real value of a pension declines and the retiree relies more heavily on the savings portfolio.

==Theory==

=== Relation to Merton's strategy ===
The allocation and withdrawal strategy of TPAW aligns with the optimal allocation and withdrawal derived in Merton (1969)&lt;ref&gt;Merton, R. C. (1969). "Lifetime Portfolio Selection under Uncertainty: the Continuous-Time Case". ''The Review of Economics and Statistics''. '''51''' (3): 247–257&lt;/ref&gt;. This spreadsheet shows the link between the two strategies. You can enter the inputs for Merton's strategy and obtain the corresponding inputs for TPAW:

* Merton's inputs matched to TPAW inputs: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wj3hM-BCL0U0FOd9_nf-uz3_Vq0_1Jy4/edit?usp=sharing&amp;ouid=102598494905177370665&amp;rtpof=true&amp;sd=true Excel] or [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e1GUsfDn6CHEh8XpTyDJN0q1DmWz7UDIW2xHhUHZOyg/edit?usp=sharing Google Sheets]

=== Deviations from Merton's strategy ===
TPAW deviates from Merton's strategy in the following ways:

* ''No borrowing'': While Merton assumes borrowing, TPAW assumes no borrowing. If Merton's strategy calls for borrowing to invest (that is, an asset allocation of more than 100% stocks, likely early on in a career), TPAW uses an an asset allocation of 100% stocks instead. And if Merton's strategy calls for borrowing to consume (a possibility in early retirement before pensions begin), TPAW only withdraws whatever is available in the savings portfolio.

* ''Extra withdrawals'': Merton's model assumes no extra spending needs in any year. TPAW allows the user to schedule extra withdrawals in desired years through the "essential expenses funded by safe bonds" and the "extra withdrawals funded by risk portfolio" columns.
* ''No savings strategy'': Besides the optimal withdrawal strategy during retirement, Merton's model also gives the optimal savings strategy when working. TPAW takes savings as given and does not model the savings decision.

===Model with borrowing===
This spreadsheet implements TPAW with borrowing, which brings it closer to Merton's strategy. The assumption that you can borrow as much as you want simplifies calculations. Answers can be obtained with formulas and do not require simulations (for example, what is the probability of withdrawals falling below $40,000 at age 70?). But it is not directly implementable in a world with borrowing constraints, so be careful when using the spreadsheet to understand if and when borrowing is being assumed and the consequences of not being able to borrow as assumed. The larger the savings portfolio is relative to future income, the less likely the model is to require borrowing. The model is most likely to call for borrowing (to invest) in early career when the savings portfolio is at its lowest and future savings is at its highest. For people with large pensions relative to savings, it might also call for borrowing (to consume) in early retirement before Social Security and pensions start. You should use the "Planner with Monte Carlo Simulation" above to ensure that your strategy will work well without borrowing. If you do not want to explore the theory behind TPAW and are looking for the quickest route to an implementable strategy that does not involve borrowing, you can ignore this spreadsheet and rely solely on the "Planner with Monte Carlo Simulation" above to devise your strategy.

===Sequence of Return Risk===
Sequence of return risk is the risk that poor returns occur when a savings portfolio is large (typically around the start of retirement) and are not fully compensated by good returns that occur when the savings portfolio is small (typically early career and late retirement).  This leads to concern that a market crash right around retirement can permanently damage a retirement because portfolios are at their peak value and very sensitive to returns. TPAW manages this risk by maintaining a fixed asset allocation on the total portfolio and employing amortization based withdrawals. This results in a strategy that is well diversified across time, making the outcome less sensitive to the timing of returns. A crash and subsequent recovery would have no harmful effect on retirement even if it occurred just prior to retirement when the savings portfolio is at its peak. During retirement, no matter when the crash occurs, the loss would be limited to reduced income during the depressed years. The income will recover fully if and when the market recovers. There would be no permanent damage to the portfolio that persists after the market has recovered.
