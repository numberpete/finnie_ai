{{for|additional information|wikipedia:Roth IRA}}

A '''Roth IRA''' is a personal savings plan, a type of [[IRA|Individual Retirement Arrangement (IRA)]], which allows you to set aside money for retirement while offering you tax advantages. In simple terms, a Roth IRA allows you to make contributions for which you get no up-front tax deduction, but once money is in the account, it grows tax-free and is also tax-free when you withdraw it (subject to a few restrictions described below). Compared to other retirement accounts, the Roth IRA offers unusual flexibility, in that contributions can ''always'' be withdrawn tax- and penalty-free, and like all Roth accounts, the Roth IRA has no [[Required Minimum Distribution|Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs)]]. Like all IRAs, Roth IRAs are individual accounts and cannot be jointly owned. 

The Roth IRA stands in contrast to the [[traditional IRA]], where contributions may be tax-deductible (subject to income limits) and growth is tax-deferred, but withdrawals are taxable. Roth and traditional IRAs share the same annual contribution limit, currently $7,000 (or $8,000 for those age 50+). The choice of whether to contribute to a [[Traditional versus Roth|traditional or Roth]] accounts can be a complex tax-planning decision.

Named after US Senator William Roth, Roth IRAs were established by the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Taxpayer Relief Act Of 1997--Conference Report|url=https://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/7/31/senate-section/article/S8415-1|accessdate=Sep 17, 2009|date=July 31, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages==

*Roth IRAs offer life-long tax-free growth on invested money. Compared to a [[Taxable account|taxable]] brokerage account where you pay tax on interest, dividends, and capital gains, a Roth IRA can offer significant tax savings, increasing the amount of money available to spend in retirement.
*Contributions can be withdrawn at any time tax- and penalty-free, a unique feature among retirement accounts which adds great flexibility. A Roth IRA can even be used to hold an [[Roth IRA as an emergency fund|emergency fund]]. 
*The tax-free structure gives you valuable space to hold [[Tax-efficient fund placement|tax-inefficient investments]], and lets you buy and sell investments for [[rebalancing]] or changing your portfolio without incurring capital gains tax.
*It is easy to find Roth IRAs with a wide selection of great investment and very low fees. 
*Unlike [[Employer retirement plans overview|employer retirement plans]] (like a [[401(k)]]), an IRA is under your complete control; an employer can't change the plan rules or investments, or add fees. 
*Although there are [[#Contribution_eligibility_and_limits|income limits]] for direct contributions, in most cases these limits can be circumvented with the [[Backdoor Roth IRA]] process.
*The contribution limit is separate from any employer plans; you can contribute up to the maximum to both accounts. The Roth IRA pairs well with a traditional employer plan, offering extra tax-advantaged space and [[Traditional_versus_Roth#Tax_diversification|tax diversification]] to mid/high-earners.
*Contributions are eligible for the [[Saver's credit]] for lower-income investors.
*Like all Roth accounts, Roth IRAs have no [[Required Minimum Distribution|Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs)]]
*Money in a Roth IRA gets more [[asset protection]] than a brokerage account; some or all of the value may be protected from creditors or bankruptcy, depending on the laws in your state.
*[[Estate planning]] benefits - money can be left to heirs easily via designated beneficiaries (avoiding [[probate]]), and non-spouse heirs generally get an additional [[Stretch IRA|ten years]] of tax-free growth before they have to empty the account.

==Disadvantages==

*Earnings on investments cannot be withdrawn before age 59½ without paying taxes and penalties, although the penalty can be waived if any of certain exceptions apply.
*Many investors in their peak earnings year should probably prefer [[Traditional versus Roth|traditional investments to Roth]], meaning they should contribute to a [[traditional IRA]] (if their income allows those contributions to be deducted) and/or a traditional employer plan (if the investments and fees are good) before a Roth IRA.
*Compared to an ERISA-governed employer plan, which gets excellent [[asset protection]] at the federal level, the Roth IRA only gets state-level protection, which may be much worse. Even if you live in a state with good asset protection for a Roth IRA, there is a chance you may later move.
*For high-earners, contributing through the [[Backdoor Roth IRA]] process adds some extra complexity and opportunities for mistakes. Backdoor Roth IRA mistakes are a common question on the [https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/index.php Bogleheads forum].

==Traditional versus Roth==
{{main|Traditional versus Roth}}

There are two basic types of IRAs, [[Traditional_IRA|traditional]] and Roth. The table below reviews some of the differences between the two account structures.

* Available to everyone with compensation (although tax-deductibility depends on income level).&lt;ref group="note"&gt;For more, see: [[Non-deductible Traditional IRA]].&lt;/ref&gt;
* Penalty free withdrawals can begin at age 59½ and are mandatory by age 73, increasing to age 75 for those born in 1960 or later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=26 U.S. Code § 401(a)(9)(C)(v) - Qualified pension, profit-sharing, and stock bonus plans|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/401#a_9_C_v|accessdate=August 29, 2025|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt; You can also make penalty free withdrawals with a defined series of [[Substantially equal periodic payments]] from an IRA.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Taxes are paid on earnings when withdrawn from the IRA.
* Withdrawals before age 59½ are subject to a 10% penalty (subject to exceptions).
* Contributions made to a Traditional IRA qualify for the Retirement Savings Contributions Credit ([[Saver's credit|Saver's Credit]]) if you meet the filing and income requirements.&lt;ref name="pub571"&gt; {{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/publications/p571/ch10.html| title=Retirement Savings Contributions Credit (Saver's Credit), Publication 571| publisher=IRS| accessdate=August 29, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

|&lt;!--- 2nd column ---&gt;
* Contributions may be made only by those having compensation and making under a certain income; anyone can [[#Conversion to Roth IRA|convert]] a Traditional IRA to a Roth. Contributions are not tax-deductible.
* Principal contributions (but not earnings) can be withdrawn at any time without penalty (subject to some minimal conditions).
* After age 59½, all earnings and principal are tax free (subject to some minimal conditions).
* There is no mandatory distribution age for the account owner, or in the case of a spousal rollover.
* Contributions made to a Roth IRA qualify for the Retirement Savings Contributions Credit ([[Saver's credit|Saver's Credit]]) if you meet the filing and income requirements.&lt;ref name="pub571" /&gt; 
|}

As a general rule of thumb, the decision as to which IRA an investor elects to use is a function of expected present and future tax rates. Thus a traditional IRA should be considered if the present [[marginal tax rate]] is expected to be higher than the future marginal rate at distribution; The Roth IRA should be considered if the present marginal tax rate is expected to be lower than the future marginal rate at distribution. If the outlook for tax rates is uncertain, you should consider diversifying contributions (or conversions) between the two account types. A Roth IRA may also be a strong candidate for consideration if the account is used as an estate planning tool. For the original account owner (and spousal inheritors) there are no required minimum distributions to deplete the account for subsequent beneficiaries. If you face estate tax a Roth conversion can produce tax savings to the estate since the income tax paid on the conversion both reduces the estate and renders tax savings since the income tax rate is lower than the estate tax rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author1=Maria A. Bruno| author2=Colleen M. Jaconetti| url=https://vanguard.com/pdf/s619.pdf| title=The IRA opportunity: To Roth or not to Roth?| publisher=Vanguard Research| date=May 2011| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190909145644/https://vanguard.com/pdf/s619.pdf| archive-date=September 9, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike traditional [[Employer retirement plans overview|employer retirement plans]] which have no income limits for contribution, the relatively low [[Traditional_IRA#Contribution_and_income_limits|income limits]] for the traditional IRA diminishes its utility for most high- and even mid-income earners. If you are phased out of deducting traditional IRA contributions, contributing to a Roth IRA is almost always better the alternative, making [[Non-deductible traditional IRA|non-deductible]] contributions to a traditional IRA. The Roth IRA has income limits too (see below), but in most cases they can be circumvented via the [[Backdoor Roth IRA]] process.

==Contribution eligibility and limits==

As of 2025, the annual combined contribution limit for all traditional and Roth IRAs is '''$7,500''', or '''$8,600''' if you are age 50 or older. This limit is separate from any employer plans, including a [[401(k)]], [[403(b)]], [[SEP|SEP-IRA]], and [[SIMPLE IRA]]. The table below shows historical maximum annual Roth contribution limits.

Your ability to contribute to a Roth IRA is limited depending on your filing status and the level of your "modified adjusted gross income". These income limits change year to year due to inflation adjustment. You can find these income limits in [https://www.irs.gov/publications/p590a/ch02.html IRS Publication 590-A: Roth IRAs] Your modified AGI for Roth IRA purposes is your adjusted gross income (AGI) as shown on your tax return modified as follows;

{| class="wikitable"
|+ Modified AGI
|-
|1. Subtract the following:
:*Conversion income. This is any income resulting from the conversion of an IRA (other than a Roth IRA) to a Roth IRA. 
:*Minimum required distributions from IRAs (for conversions only).
|-
|2. Add the following deductions and exclusions:
:*Traditional IRA deduction,
:*Student loan interest deduction,
:*Tuition and fees deduction,
:*Domestic production activities deduction,
:*Foreign earned income exclusion,
:*Foreign housing exclusion or deduction,
:*Exclusion of qualified bond interest shown on Form 8815, and
:*Exclusion of employer-provided adoption benefits shown on Form 8839.&lt;ref name="pub590"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/publications/p590/ch02.html| title=Publication 590: Roth IRAs| publisher=IRS}}{{dead link}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Income limits for Roth IRA contributions are shown below. Contributions limits are reduced linearly within the phase-out range.

|-
| Married Filing Jointly || $242,000 || $252,000
|-
| Married Filing Separately and living with spouse || $0 || $10,000
|}

Most investors are able to circumvent these income limits via the [[Backdoor Roth IRA]] process.   This process entails (1) making a non-deducted contribution to a traditional IRA, and (2) shortly thereafter, [[Roth conversion|converting]] that money to a Roth IRA. These two steps have the same net effect as a direct Roth IRA contribution, but neither has an income limit.

IRA contributions are also limited by the amount of your compensation. Compensation includes wages, salaries, commissions, self-employment income, taxable alimony and separate maintenance, nontaxable combat pay, taxable non-tuition fellowship and stipend payments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Publication 590-A (2021), Contributions to Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs)|url=https://www.irs.gov/publications/p590a|access-date=February 19, 2022|website=Internal Revenue Service|series="Who Can Open a Traditional IRA?" and Table 1-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The total amount you can contribute to your IRAs cannot be greater than the amount of your compensation for the year of the contribution. For married couples filing jointly, the compensation of either spouse can be used to make the contributions to each person’s IRAs. It makes no difference which spouse has the compensation, but the total compensation cannot be less than the total of the IRA contributions for both individuals.

If you are working for someone else, compensation will be reported in Box 1 of your W-2. If you are working for a business you own, your compensation is the net income reported on the Schedule C less 50% of the self-employment taxes you pay. Other types of income do not fit the definition of compensation and cannot be used for Roth IRA contributions (except for commissions and taxable alimony and separate maintenance). 

===Roth IRA for children===
{{Main article|Accounts for children}}

Parents sometimes wonder if it is okay to contribute to a Roth IRA for their children. As stated above, it is necessary to have compensation in order to contribute to an IRA (Traditional or Roth). Children can obtain compensation by working for a business, as a household employee (for example, babysitting, mowing lawns, etc), or through self-employment. Very young children have few options for legitimate work, but can perform acting or modeling. There are advantages for parents with businesses to hire their children in appropriate jobs, but need to be careful to avoid paying children for household chores through their business. Parents should be aware that a child who has self-employment income over $400 must pay self-employment taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-utl/OC-Whateverystudentshouldknowaboutsummerjobsandtaxes.pdf| title=What every student should know about summer jobs and taxes| publisher=IRS| accessdate=May 26, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, for many jobs that children may have, they would be classified as household employees, rather than self-employed, and would not be subject to employment taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p926.pdf| title=Household Employer's Tax Guide| publisher=IRS| accessdate=December 11, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; While there are proponents for parents paying their children for household chores and using that compensation as the basis for Roth IRA contributions, others, including the Tax Court, take a dim view of considering parents and children in an employer/employee relationship regarding household chores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://fairmark.com/retirement/roth-accounts/contributions-to-roth-accounts/roth-iras-for-minors/| title=Roth IRAs for Minors| publisher=Fairmark| author=Kaye A.

==Conversion to Roth IRA==
{{Main|Roth conversion}}
{{Notice|Recharacterization of Roth IRA conversions made in 2018 or later are no longer permitted.}}

Roth conversions from a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA require you to pay the tax due (without an early withdrawal penalty) on any previously untaxed Traditional IRA assets converted. In general, conversions work best when you are in a low tax bracket and when the source of funds for paying the tax are available outside of the IRA. If the tax is paid out of the converted assets, the payment may be considered an early distribution and is subject to both income tax and, if you are under age 59½, a 10% early withdrawal penalty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Natalie Choate| title=Life and Death Planning for Retirement Benefits| edition=6th| p=247| isbn=0-9649440-7-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since new conversion rules were implemented in 2010, there have been no income limits or filing status requirements for converting a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA. In 2010 alone, investors were given the option of paying the taxes on the conversion either all in 2010 or in equal amounts in 2011 and 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/publications/p590/ch02.html#en_US_publink1000230961| title=Publication 590 (2009), Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs)| publisher=IRS}}{{dead link}} Applies for any 2010 rollover from an IRA, except from Roth IRA to Roth IRA.&lt;/ref&gt; Investors whose incomes exceed the limits for allowing contributions to a Roth IRA should consider the option of contributing to a [[Non-deductible Traditional IRA]] and executing a [[Backdoor Roth IRA]].

For the tax consequences of taking a distribution of converted assets see [[#Distributions Roth IRA | Distributions]] below.

If you wish to undo a conversion done in 2017 or earlier, you do so by executing an '''[[IRA recharacterization]]'''. Undoing a conversion might result from finding that:
*You are in a higher tax bracket than intended, possibly from increased income near the end of the year.
*You find that you do not have sufficient funds to pay the conversion tax.
*The market value of the converted assets has fallen in price after the conversion and you can save on taxes by recharacterizing the conversion and then, in accordance with IRS restrictions, reconverting the assets at the lower value.

==Distributions==

The amounts you withdraw from a Roth IRA are considered to come out of the account in the following order of categories, each with its own tax consequences:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.kitces.com/blog/understanding-the-two-5-year-rules-for-roth-ira-contributions-and-conversions| title=Understanding The Two 5-Year Rules For Roth IRA Contributions And Conversions| author=Michael Kitces| date=January 1, 2014| accessdate=June 19, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#Regular contributions 
#Taxable portion of first conversion (portion that was taxed at time of conversion)
#Nontaxable portion of first conversion 
#Each subsequent conversion, in chronological order but with conversions aggregated by calendar year, with the taxable portion coming out first for each conversion 
#Earnings (any increase in value occurring inside the Roth IRA)&lt;ref name="Fairmark_Distribution"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.fairmark.com/rothira/distrib.htm| title=Roth IRA Distribution Overview| publisher=Fairmark| author=Kaye A. Thomas| date=February 11, 2018| accessdate=June 19, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=April 5, 2023|title=Publication 590-B (2022), Distributions from Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs)|url=https://www.irs.gov/publications/p590b#en_US_2022_publink100089915|access-date=May 15, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Note that conversions are quantized and aggregated by calendar year. For example, if you did three conversions in a given calendar year, then later take distributions in excess of your contributions, you would first distribute the total taxable amount of those three conversions, then the total nontaxable amount, then move on to subsequent calendar years.

The tax treatment is summarized in the following table, from information supplied by KAWill (Fairmark). A "Qualified" distribution incurs no federal tax or penalty.

===Details===

Details on the categories of assets are as follows:
#Regular contributions can be withdrawn at any time with no tax and no penalty. This category includes your life-long direct contributions, plus any elective deferrals you have rolled in from a designated Roth account.
#Taxable portion of a conversion applies only when the lifetime total of withdrawals from all Roth IRAs exceeds the lifetime total of regular contributions to Roth IRAs plus the lifetime total of earlier conversions.
##If withdrawn before the first day of the fifth year after the year of the conversion: no tax, but will be subject to 10% early withdrawal penalty if you are under age 59½ unless an exception applies.{{#tag:ref|Exceptions to the early withdrawal penalty tax on converted assets include total disability, or death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Natalie Choate| title=Life and Death Planning for Retirement Benefits| edition=6th| page=248| isbn=0-9649440-7-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group="note"}}
##Beginning on the first day of the fifth year after the year of the conversion can be withdrawn at any time with no tax and no penalty. 
##Special rules apply to withdrawals of amounts converted in 2010. 
#Nontaxable portion of any rollover
##Applies only after the taxable portion of the same conversion has been withdrawn.
##Can be withdrawn at any time with no tax and no penalty. 
#Earnings
##Applies only after all amounts other than earnings have been withdrawn.
##If withdrawn before the first day of the fifth year after the year you first established a Roth IRA, taxable as ordinary income; also subject to the 10% early withdrawal penalty if you are under age 59½ unless an exception applies. 
##Beginning on the first day of the fifth year after the year you first established a Roth IRA, can be withdrawn with no tax and no penalty if you are over age 59½ or otherwise meet the requirements for a qualified distribution (death, disability, first-time homeowner). Otherwise, withdrawals of earnings continue to be taxable as ordinary income and, unless an exception applies, subject to the 10% early withdrawal penalty.&lt;ref name="Fairmark_Distribution" /&gt;

When you roll in money into a Roth IRA from a designated Roth account (like a [[401(k)#Roth_401(k)|Roth 401(k)]]) and later take a distribution, some special rules apply:&lt;ref&gt;{{forum link| t=460217| title=Roth 401(k) rollover resets 5-year rule}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*When you roll in money consisting of direct Roth contributions (elective deferrals), that amount gets added to the "contributions" bucket, and can therefore be withdrawn anytime tax- and penalty-free. This amount gets reported to you in Box 5 of the [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1099r.pdf Form 1099-R] for the rollover. 
**Any earnings you roll in goes into the "earnings" bucket, and comes out last, but possibly subject to taxes and penalties. 
*When you roll money in from an [[After-tax 401(k)]], for example as part of a [[Mega-backdoor Roth]], it behaves the same way as a Roth conversion from an IRA - the taxable (if any) and nontaxable portions come out in chronological order with respect to other conversions. 
*When you roll money in that was previously moved into a designed Roth account via an In-plan Roth Rollover (IRR), that is considered a converted amount on the date of the original IRR, and the taxable and nontaxable (if any) portions come out after earlier converted amounts.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;There is a complication with this rule, as described by forum member Alan S.: "There's an IRS design problem however with respect to distributing the amount from an IRR after rolling to a Roth IRA. The problem is that the IRS 8606 instructions indicate that IRRs be reported on line 22 of Form 8606. If that is done, then the penalty recapture chart (Appendix C in Pub 590 B) produces an incorrect result in favor of the taxpayer who then escapes the recapture tax on Form 5329. The IRS has allowed this disconnect to exist for 14 years now, which illustrates that Appendix C is not on their radar. No telling how tax software addresses this, but it's most likely designed to follow the 8606 Inst. The recommended fix for this problem is to not include IRRs on line 22 of Form 8606 as the instructions indicate. Put them on line 24 instead where Roth conversions go. If you do that then Appendix C will work as clearly intended by the IRS in [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-10-84.pdf Notice 2010-84].&lt;/ref&gt;

When a Roth IRA is ''qualified'' - that is, when the owner is at least 59½ or disabled, and has had a Roth IRA for at least 5 years - all withdrawals are tax- and penalty-free, including any money once rolled in from a designated Roth account (such as a Roth 401k).

===Early distributions===

The table above shows there can be tax consequences to taking distributions from a Roth IRA prior to age 59½ or before the Roth has been held for a minimum of five years for both contributions as well as for each Roth conversion. Furthermore, there may be state-specific rules regarding non-qualified distributions. For example, in New Jersey, non-qualified withdrawals from a Roth IRA are treated as proportional withdrawals of contributions and gains, so tax and penalty would be due on the gain portion.&lt;ref&gt;{{forum link| p=5388305| title=Roth IRA Idea: Burst my bubble}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.state.nj.us/treasury/taxation/pdf/pubs/tgi-ee/git2.pdf| title=IRA Withdrawals| publisher=New Jersey Tax Topic Bulletin GIT-2| accessdate=August 1, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are exceptions to the early withdrawal penalty, such as birth or adoption, disability, disaster recovery, higher education, first-time homebuying, and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/plan-participant-employee/retirement-topics-exceptions-to-tax-on-early-distributions| title=Retirement topics - Exceptions to tax on early distributions| publisher=Internal Revenue Service| accessdate=August 30, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt; Note that while the exceptions can waive the ''penalty'' for early withdrawals, only disability and the first-time home buyer exception also waive the ''tax'' assessed on withdrawing earnings before age 59½, and only if you have had a Roth IRA for at least 5 years.

===Roth 5 year rule summary===

The [https://www.schwab.com/learn/story/what-to-know-about-five-year-rule-roths following article] is a good summary of the various iterations of the 5 year rule, both for personal and designated Roth accounts.

===Inherited Roth IRAs===

While a Roth IRA does not impose [[Required Minimum Distribution|Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs)]] for the original Roth IRA owner, or for a spouse who elects to treat an [[Inheriting a Roth IRA |inherited Roth IRA]] as their own in a spousal rollover, non-spousal inheritors distribution rules vary. Most non-spouse beneficiaries no longer have RMDs, but must distribute the Roth in entirety by the end of the 10th year after death of decedent. Certain exceptions, referred to as Eligible Designated Beneficiaries, are  required to take RMDs of the Roth over their life expectancies.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Minors under 21 are able to use lifetime stretch RMDs until they turn 21, after which no RMDs are required, but then they must liquidate their Roth entirely by the end of the 10th year after their 21st birthday.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{for|additional information|wikipedia:Traditional IRA}}

A '''traditional IRA''' (Individual Retirement Arrangement) is a personal savings plan which allows you to set aside money for retirement, while offering you tax advantages. You may be able to deduct some or all of your contributions to your traditional IRA. Amounts in your IRA, including earnings, generally are not taxed until distributed to you. See [[IRA|the general IRA wiki page]] for information which applies to all types of IRAs, including the traditional IRA.

==Description==

A traditional IRA allows investors to make either deductible (deducted) or non-deductible (not deducted) contributions, at their option. The annual IRA contribution limit of $7,500, or $8,600 for individuals age 50 and over (as of 2026), applies to all deductible and non-deductible traditional IRA contributions and Roth IRA contributions. When you make non-deductible contributions to a traditional IRA, those contributions become after-tax ''basis'' within the account. Deductible contributions and all growth within the account are pre-tax, and therefore taxable as income when withdrawn. The IRS requires all withdrawals (including for Roth conversions) from a traditional IRA to be “pro-rata” between the pre-tax and after-tax portions. For example, if you make a $1,000 withdrawal from a traditional IRA with a balance of $10,000 and a basis of $6,000, the withdrawal will be 60% ($6,000 / $10,000) non-taxable basis and 40% pre-tax. Therefore, the basis would decrease by $600 to $5,400, and $400 of the withdrawal would be considered taxable income. A fully deductible traditional IRA is a special case of a traditional IRA with a basis of 0.  

Growth within a traditional IRA (for example, interest, dividends, and capital gains) is not taxable in the year it is earned. Rather, taxes on growth are fully deferred until withdrawal. This makes a traditional IRA (along with a Roth IRA and [[Employer_retirement_plans_overview|workplace retirement plans]]) a good place to hold [[Tax-efficient fund placement|tax-inefficient investments]] and to perform [[rebalancing]] trades that sell appreciated investments.

Losses from a traditional IRA – when you make a withdrawal when the balance is less than the basis – are ''not'' tax-deductible, unlike with a [[Taxable account|taxable account]]. 

===Contribution and income limits===

The maximum contribution limit for 2025 is $7,000, or $8,000 for those 50 and older; for 2026, it is '''$7,500''', or '''$8,600''' for those age 50 or older.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/401k-limit-increases-to-24500-for-2026-ira-limit-increases-to-7500| title=401(k) limit increases to $24,500 for 2026, IRA limit increases to $7,500| publisher=IRS| accessdate=27 November 2025}}{&lt;/ref&gt;  You cannot contribute more than your compensation for the year. Compensation includes wages, salaries, etc., commissions, self-employment income, taxable alimony and separate maintenance, nontaxable combat pay, taxable non-tuition fellowship and stipend payments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Publication 590-A (2021), Contributions to Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs)|url=https://www.irs.gov/publications/p590a|access-date=February 19, 2022|website=Internal Revenue Service|series="Who Can Open a Traditional IRA?" and Table 1-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Married spouses can also contribute to their own IRAs, even if they did not earn any income. The total contribution for both spouses cannot be greater than the total joint compensation.

Prior to the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SECURE_Act_of_2019 SECURE Act of 2019], traditional IRA owners could not make contributions after age 70½ regardless of whether they had compensation, but this bill removed that restriction. There is now no age limit to contribute to a traditional IRA.

Deduction of contributions to a traditional IRA is subject to limitations according to your [[Traditional IRA#Contribution_Eligibility_and_Limits|Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI)]]:

If you fall inside the phase-out range, the deduction limit is scaled linearly form 100% to 0. For example, a single filer under age 50 with a MAGI of $82,000 would be able deduct up to '''$6,750''' (=$7,500 * ($82,000 - $81,000) / ($91,000 - $81,000) ) of traditional IRA contributions.

For the purposes of traditional IRA contribution deductions, Modified Adjusted Gross Income is defined as Adjusted Gross Income with the following modifications:

{| class="wikitable"
|+ Modified AGI 
|-

:*Conversion income. This is any income resulting from the conversion of an IRA (other than a Roth IRA) to a Roth IRA.

|2. Add the following deductions and exclusions:
:*Traditional IRA deduction,

|}

===Tracking of basis===
{{See also |Non-deductible traditional IRA#Cost basis |label 1=Non-deductible traditional IRA § Cost basis}}

Financial institutions that hold traditional IRAs do not track the basis. When making a traditional IRA contribution, you do not need to tell the financial institution whether the contribution is deductible or non-deductible. In fact, you do not need to decide whether you want contributions to be deductible until you file your taxes for that tax year.

The basis of your traditional IRA is tracked on [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f8606.pdf IRS Form 8606], which you are required to file with your federal income tax every year your basis changes. The basis of a traditional IRA increases whenever you make non-deductible contributions. The basis decreases whenever you make a traditional IRA withdrawal, or Roth conversion, when you have a non-zero basis.

You are not required to file a Form 8606 for years where your traditional IRA basis doesn’t change, even if the basis is non-zero.

[[File:F8606 2018.png|thumb|right|IRS Form 8606, tax year 2018]]

===The "pro-rata" rule===

Stated simply, the "pro-rata" rule means that withdrawals from a traditional IRA are considered to a mix of pre-tax and after-tax funds, in proportion to the relative sizes of the two balances. The pro-rata rule has some unexpected details. The rule is applied to the combined balance of ALL traditional IRAs, [[SEP|SEP-IRAs]], and [[SIMPLE IRA|SIMPLE IRAs]] that an individual owns. For example, if you have a $10,000 traditional IRA with a $10,000 basis (all non-deductible contributions) and a $90,000 SEP-IRA, a $10,000 withdrawal from the traditional IRA, only 10% ($10,000 / ($10,000 + $90,000)) will be withdrawal of basis and 90% will be taxable. Even though the traditional IRA has a balance of $0 and could even be closed, the remaining $9,000 of basis is effectively transferred to the SEP-IRA. 

The pro-rata rule is applied based on the combined balance of all traditional, SIMPLE, and SEP-IRAs as of December 31st of the year in which the withdrawal is made. This gives the taxpayer some flexibility, for example, to roll over a traditional IRA into a 401k later in the year after making a [[Backdoor Roth IRA]] contribution. 

A spouse’s IRA balances are not considered in the pro-rata calculation. Neither is an inherited traditional IRA. If you have an inherited traditional IRA with a non-zero basis, you will need to file a separate Form 8606 for withdrawals from that IRA. If you are the decedent's spouse, you have the option to combine the traditional IRA with your own, in which case the basis and pre-tax balance would transfer to you, and you would continue to file a single Form 8606.

====Exceptions to the “pro-rata” rule====

There are two exceptions when funds withdrawn from a traditional IRA are not subject to the pro-rata rule:

*When a traditional IRA is rolled into a [[401(k)]] or other [[Employer retirement plans overview|qualified plan]], only the pre-tax portion is rolled over. The non-deductible basis remains within the IRA, which could subsequently be converted to a [[Roth IRA]] tax-free.
*When making [[Qualified charitable distributions|Qualified Charitable Distributions (QCDs)]] from a traditional IRA, only the pre-tax portion is removed, keeping the basis intact.

===Backdoor Roth IRA===
{{Main|Backdoor Roth IRA}}

The Backdoor Roth IRA is a process used to indirectly contribute to a [[Roth IRA]] for taxpayers whose Modified Adjusted Gross Income prevents them from contributing to a Roth IRA directly. There are two steps to a Backdoor Roth IRA:

*Non-deductible contribution to a traditional IRA 
*[[Roth IRA conversion|Conversion]] (usually, shortly thereafter) of the entire traditional IRA to a Roth IRA

The net result of these two transactions is the same as a direct contribution to a Roth IRA. Neither of these two steps has any income limitations, and so taxpayers of any income can make Backdoor Roth IRA contributions. Aside from the complexity, there is no real disadvantage to using the Backdoor process. Due to the pro-rata rule, if you have any other traditional IRAs, SEP-IRAs, or SIMPLE IRAs with pre-tax balances, the Backdoor Roth IRA will not work as intended, and will instead be mostly a conversion of pre-tax IRA balance. For those with an income high enough to need the Backdoor Roth IRA, this will result in a significant tax cost. See the [[Backdoor Roth IRA|main article]] for details.

===Non-deductible traditional IRA===
{{Main|Non-deductible traditional IRA}}

A "Non-deductible traditional IRA" or "Nondeductible IRA" not a separate type of account, but rather results when non-deductible (not deducted) contributions are made to a traditional IRA. Generally, the tax benefits of making non-deductible contributions to a traditional IRA are inferior to either a Roth IRA, or deductible contributions to a traditional IRA. Compared to a [[Taxable account|taxable account]], a Non-deductible IRA has better performance for certain types of investments and worse performance for others, combined with low contribution limits and much less liquidity. Due to the availability of the [[Backdoor Roth IRA]], situations where non-deductible contributions in a traditional IRA make sense are limited. See the [[Non-deductible_traditional_IRA|main article]] for a comparison to other types of accounts, and a performance analysis.

==Rollovers and transfers== 
{{main|IRA rollovers and transfers}}
{{401k rollover infobox}}
A significant amount of traditional IRA assets and annual contributions come from the transfer or rollover of employer retirement plan assets. These  transfer/rollovers occur when an employee severs employment from the employer whether voluntarily through job switching or retiring, or through lay-offs or firings. Employees may wish to transfer an employer plan to a traditional IRA in order to consolidate accounts, reduce plan management expense, or to retain the right to transfer the transferred assets to another employer provided plan. Transfers of traditional IRA accounts occur in three manners:

:*''' Direct Trustee-to-Trustee Transfers'''
:*'''Rollovers'''
:*'''Transfers incident to a divorce''' 

IRA rollovers and transfers can become complicated. Refer to [[IRA Rollovers and Transfers]] for detailed consideration of this topic.

==Required Minimum Distributions==
{{main|Required Minimum Distribution}}

Traditional IRAs have Required Minimum Distributions that generally begin the year the account holder reaches age 73. See the [[Required Minimum Distribution|main page]] for a discussion of the details. 

[[Inheriting an IRA|Inherited IRAs]] (traditional and Roth) inherited prior to January 1, 2020 have Required Minimum Distributions calculated by [http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p590b.pdf IRS Publication 590-B Distribution Table I]. Inherited IRAs inherited ''after'' January 1, 2020 have no RMDs, but must be emptied and closed within ten years of being inherited, unless certain exceptions apply. 

==Penalties for early withdrawals and excess contributions==
===Early withdrawals===

Early withdrawals are generally amounts distributed from your traditional IRA account before you are age 59 1/2. You must pay a 10% additional tax on the distribution of any assets from your traditional IRA before you are age 59 1/2.

:'''Exceptions to the penalty apply if the early withdrawal is:'''
:* made to a beneficiary or estate on account of the IRA owner's death,
:* made on account of disability,
:* made as part of a series of [[SEPP:Substantially_Equal_Periodic_Payments|substantially equal periodic payments]] over your life or life expectancy,
:* made to pay for a qualified first–time home purchase,
:* not above your qualified higher education expenses,
:* not above certain medical insurance premiums paid while unemployed,
:* not above your unreimbursed medical expenses that are more than a certain percentage of your adjusted gross income, or
:* due to an IRS levy.

===Excess contributions===

Contributing more than the allowed amount in any year to your traditional IRA also subjects you to an additional tax. Any excess contribution not withdrawn by the date your tax return for the year is due (including extensions) is subject to a 6% tax. You must pay the 6% tax each year on excess amounts that remain in your traditional IRA at the end of your tax year. Also, any earnings on the excess contribution must be withdrawn as well,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-regs/td9056.pdf |title= IRS Treasury Decision 9056: Earnings Calculation for Returned or Recharacterized IRA Contributions |last= |first= |date= |website= |publisher=Internal Revenue Service (IRS) |accessdate= May 19, 2023 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are taxed as ordinary income.

If you cannot contribute to a [[Roth IRA]] because your income exceeds the income eligibility limit, you can still choose to contribute indirectly through a two step process known informally as the '''backdoor Roth'''.

If you have already made a Roth contribution but now realize your income is too high, the [[IRA_recharacterization|IRA recharacterization]] process allows you to treat that contribution as if it were made to a traditional account instead.

Shown in the figure below, you do the backdoor Roth as follows:

# Make a nondeductible (that is, taxed and not deducted) contribution to a [[traditional IRA]].
# Then [[Roth IRA conversion|convert]] the traditional IRA to a Roth IRA.

The net effect of performing these two steps is equivalent to contributing to a Roth IRA. Because there are no income limits for either of these steps, you can use this backdoor Roth technique to effectively contribute to a Roth IRA regardless of how high your income is. You just need to have compensation in the tax year for which you will be contributing.  Due to the SECURE ACT signed in 2019, there are no longer age limits on IRA contributions. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Benz|first=Christine|date=April 16, 2024|title=You Can Make IRA Contributions at Any Age, but Should You?|url=https://www.morningstar.com/retirement/you-can-make-ira-contributions-any-age-should-you|website=Morningstar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no such IRA called a "backdoor Roth IRA", because the backdoor Roth is a &lt;i&gt;process&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;technique&lt;/i&gt;, not an &lt;i&gt;account&lt;/i&gt;. The IRS does not recognize a "nondeductible traditional IRA", because it is the &lt;i&gt;contributions&lt;/i&gt; that are nondeductible (that is, not deducted), not the &lt;i&gt;IRA&lt;/i&gt;. There is also a &lt;i&gt;process&lt;/i&gt; called [[mega-backdoor Roth]] that is completely different from the backdoor Roth, and they are independent of each other. The IRS does not officially recognize the term "backdoor Roth", and as a result, some tax preparers are not familiar with it either. The term is just a shortcut phrase that investors use. So if you come across someone who has never heard of it, just use the terms "contribute" and "convert" instead, because that is what is really happening.

Before proceeding with a backdoor Roth, consider that it is much easier to contribute directly to a Roth IRA if you are eligible to do so.

==Definitions==
First, there are three terms to understand when doing backdoor Roths:

;Taxable compensation : The IRS defines this as taxable wages, salaries, commissions, self-employment income, alimony and separate maintenance (nontaxable combat pay is also applicable for an IRA contribution). It excludes earnings and profits from property, interest and dividend income, pension or annuity income, deferred compensation, income from certain partnerships, or any amounts (other than combat pay) you exclude from income.&lt;ref name="590A"&gt;{{cite web|title=Publication 590-A (2017), Contributions to Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs)|url=https://www.irs.gov/publications/p590a|accessdate=December 30, 2018|publisher=Internal Revenue Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Traditional IRA : As used on this page, the term refers to each of your non-Roth IRAs, that are also not [[Inheriting an IRA|inherited IRAs]]. These include [[Traditional IRA | traditional IRAs]], [[Rollover IRA | rollover IRAs]] (also known as conduit IRAs), [[SEP | SEP-IRAs]], and [[SIMPLE IRA | SIMPLE IRAs]], including those held at different custodians. The total year-end value of ALL of these accounts will be taken into account when calculating taxes for a backdoor Roth.

; Basis (or cost basis) : This is the total amount of nondeductible contributions in your traditional IRAs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/publications/p590b|title=Publication 590-B (2017), Distributions from Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs)|accessdate=December 11, 2018|publisher=Internal Revenue Service}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a fixed dollar amount and does not grow as the account value grows. It stays steady until one of the following occurs: 1) another nondeductible contribution is added (the basis increases), 2) a rollover of an after-tax 401k contribution is made to a traditional or rollover IRA (the basis increases), 3) a Roth conversion or withdrawal from the account removes some/all of it (the basis decreases).
: The basis also is not associated with any particular account. Rather, it is an accounting device that you would need to report to the IRS each year it changes. You report the increase or decrease in basis using [https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-8606 IRS Form 8606].
: [https://www.irs.gov/publications/p590a#en_US_2020_publink1000230521 IRS Pub. 590-A] refers to this as "cost basis". This is the same word, but has a slightly differently meaning than the [[Cost basis methods |&lt;i&gt;cost basis&lt;/i&gt;]] used when calculating capital gains.
:For more, see: [[Non-deductible traditional IRA#Cost basis|Non-deductible traditional IRA § Cost basis]]

==Overview== 
When you do a backdoor Roth, you first make a nondeductible contribution (that is, already taxed) to a traditional IRA. After that transaction completes (usually in one business day), you do a Roth conversion. 

However, your pre-existing traditional IRAs will likely be entirely deductible contributions and their pre-tax earnings. When you do a Roth conversion, you cannot limit your conversion to just your nondeductible contribution. When filing your income taxes, Form 8606 considers all your traditional IRAs as if the accounts were merged in one traditional IRA, regardless of which account the Roth conversion money came from.

For example: If your nondeductible contribution is only 25% of all the money in your traditional IRAs, then only 25% of your Roth conversion amount will be tax-free. The remaining 75% of your Roth conversion amount will represent the deductible (pre-tax) money across all of your traditional IRAs. Consequently, you will owe tax (at your current income tax rate) on 75% of your Roth conversion amount (see Example 3a below). If you can transfer your pre-tax IRA funds to a solo [[401(k)]], employer-sponsored 401k, or [[403(b)]], then they will no longer be subject to taxation during the Roth conversion process.

However, in the cases where part of the conversion amount was taxed, some of your basis is considered to have been converted tax-free while some still remains for use with the rest of your traditional IRAs. Some of this basis will hang around until all of your traditional IRAs (as defined here) are empty and you will have to file [https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-8606 Form 8606] each year until then.

==Details==
===Contribute===
To do a backdoor Roth, first make a regular contribution to a traditional IRA with your IRA custodian. You do not need to tell the custodian whether the contribution is deductible or not; it is just treated as an IRA contribution. The custodian does not know (or care) if any contribution is deductible or not. That is known only to you, the IRS (and your state, if you file state income taxes), and your tax preparer. In fact, you can change your mind as to any contribution being deductible or not, up until the time you file your tax return.

"Nondeductible" simply means that you do not deduct the IRA contribution on your 1040 tax form. The transaction is recorded on Form 8606 instead and submitted with your tax return. This nondeductible contribution becomes your "basis" if you do not yet have any or is added to your existing "basis" when you prepare your taxes. One important thing to know about your basis, is that it does not grow, except by making additional nondeductible contributions. All the growth for the traditional IRA will instead be pre-tax.

The amount of the nondeductible contribution is limited to the maximum you are eligible to contribute each year, after taking other IRA contributions for the year into account. For example, the maximum IRA contribution in 2024/2025 is $7,000 per person (or $8,000 if over age 50). If you are eligible for, and make, a $4,000 traditional contribution (deductible or nondeductible), you can only make a $3,000  contribution to a Roth IRA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=l|first=Cornell Legal Information Institute|title=26 U.S. Code § 408A - Roth IRAs|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/408A|website=Cornell Law School}}&lt;/ref&gt; You cannot contribute more than your taxable compensation for the year. Non-working married spouses can also contribute to their own IRAs, even if they did not earn any income. The total contribution for both spouses cannot be greater than the total joint taxable compensation.

You can make the contribution up until the April filing deadline of the following year. The conversion can be done any time after that. In this case, you report the nondeductible contribution on Form 8606 for the tax year it applied to, but will not impact your taxes for that tax year. You will report the conversion for the year in which it happened (along with the carried-forward basis). Converting in a later year than the year of contribution would be useful for someone rolling over their traditional or rollover IRA to a 401k at year end where it is not completed by December 31. However, they would then need to file Form 8606 for both years.

===Convert===
After the contribution transaction is complete, convert it to a Roth IRA. (You can also convert more or less than that amount, as will be shown in the examples below.) The Roth account may be an existing or new account. Accomplish this transaction by "moving" or "exchanging" the cash or shares in your traditional IRA and use this to buy cash or shares in a Roth IRA. As an example, at Vanguard this is a fund exchange. Go to the traditional IRA and select "Exch" which is listed next to "Buy" and "Sell." Identify the cash/shares to be moved. Then select the Roth account on the right hand side, and select the destination fund.

Another way to convert is to call the custodian and ask them to do it by giving the originating and destination account numbers and the amount (or fund) to convert.

If you did not have any pre-existing traditional IRAs and your contribution was nondeductible you would normally convert the &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;entire&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; balance, even if the balance is higher or lower than the amount that you contributed. You pay tax only on the growth, if any, above the amount contributed. If you held the nondeductible contributions in the traditional IRA for only a few days, the tax should be minimal.

If you had pre-existing traditional IRAs, and your contribution was nondeductible, the contribution amount is considered your basis and your tax will be [[Traditional_IRA#The_.22pro-rata.22_rule|pro-rated]] over all conversions and withdrawals, until the traditional IRAs are empty.

==Cautions==
If you have pre-tax money in ''any'' traditional IRA, the taxable portion of any conversion you make is prorated over all your traditional IRAs; you cannot convert just the nondeductible amount.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/rollovers-of-after-tax-contributions-in-retirement-plans| title=Rollovers of After-Tax Contributions in Retirement Plans| publisher=IRS| accessdate=August 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are three options for how to deal with an existing traditional IRA getting in the way of a backdoor Roth IRA:

* Convert the entire traditional IRA to Roth, and pay tax on the pre-tax amount of the conversion. For a small traditional IRA this may be the easiest and best option, but if the traditional IRA is large, this will result in a large tax bill. If you are making backdoor Roth IRA contributions, you are in a middle or high tax bracket, so this might be undesirable.
* Roll the pre-tax portion of the traditional IRA into your [[401(k)]] or [[403(b)]] or [[457(b)]] at work, assuming it accepts rollovers. If the employer plan has poor investment options or high fees (or both), this may be undesirable. However, if the employer plan is large and well-managed, it may have access to institutional share classes with even lower expenses than are available in the IRA. 
* Start a business, open an Individual [[401(k)]] that accepts rollovers, and roll over the traditional IRA into the Individual 401(k). The amount of the rollover is not limited by the amount earned by the business. For example, a $10&amp;nbsp;million traditional IRA can be rolled into an Individual 401(k) opened on $10 of legitimately-earned self employment income.

In any case, you have until December 31st of the tax year in which you make the backdoor Roth IRA conversion to empty the traditional IRA. If you still have a traditional IRA balance on December 31st, then the [[Traditional_IRA#The_.22pro-rata.22_rule|pro-rata rule]] will apply to the conversion. For example, if you attempt to make a backdoor Roth IRA contribution of $6,000 while having a traditional IRA with a pre-tax balance of $50,000, then only '''10.7%''' ($6,000 / ($50,000 + $6,000)) of the conversion step will apply to the non-deductible amount, and the remainder will be converted from the pre-tax amount. This will result in '''$5,357''' ($6,000 * (1 - 10.7%)) of taxable income.

Because IRAs are ''individual'' accounts, the IRAs of one spouse do not affect the proration of the other spouse's conversion, even when filing tax Married Filing Jointly. Similarly, if someone has an inherited IRA with some basis in it as well as their own traditional IRAs (with or without basis), the tax calculations for the inherited IRA are done separately from the other traditional IRAs the beneficiary may have. In these cases, spouses need to file Form 8606 individually as well as for each inherited IRA having a basis.

When you leave an employer and you want to roll the employer's retirement plan to an IRA, request a single distribution but direct the after-tax distributions to a Roth IRA and the pre-tax distributions to a rollover IRA (which is one of the forms of a traditional IRA). While money is in the rollover IRA, DO NOT make any other contributions directly to that account. This will help make it possible for a future employer plan to accept the rollover IRA, because some employer plans do not accept money from contributory traditional IRAs (IRAs to which you contributed directly, instead of withheld from your paycheck). In other words, keep your rollover IRAs separated from your other IRAs. If you have already co-mingled employer plan rollovers with IRAs you have contributed to, the plan documents from a future employer plan will tell if the rollover back to a 401k or 403b is allowed.

Before you start the backdoor Roth, you should also understand IRS Form 8606 (examples below), as you will file it with your income taxes for the year. Fill out a rough draft of the form to understand the tax implications and see if the contribution or conversion impacts anything else in your tax situation. The front of the form deals with your basis from the previous and the current year, while part of the back of the form deals with the Roth conversion. Understanding this formula will help you see what part of your Roth conversion or traditional IRA withdrawal will be tax-free and how much will be taxed:

==Examples with Form 8606==

The [https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-8606 Form 8606] examples below use the following simple formula:
:'''ND''' = Amount of basis remaining from the previous year '''plus''' nondeductible contributions made for this year&lt;br&gt;
:'''SB''' = Sum of the balances of all your traditional IRAs at year-end '''plus''' the amount withdrawn from traditional IRAs (but not converted) '''plus''' the amount converted&lt;br&gt;
:'''TF''' = The percentage of the amount you convert (or withdraw without converting) that is tax-free for the year
::TF = 100 * ( ND / SB )

The examples use graphics to illustrate the pro rata rule. This color key shows the tax status of the various portions of the money.

A chart showing the data to be entered on Form 8606 for each example follows at the end.

===Example 1===
Ann has no traditional IRAs. She knows she will pay the same amount of tax on $6,000 of her high income (for 2019) whether she deposits it into her taxable account or puts it in a Roth. She is ineligible to contribute to the Roth directly due to her high income. So it is obvious for her to put it in a Roth where it can grow tax-free. She opens up a new traditional IRA and deposits $6,000 in it and will declare it as a nondeductible contribution when she files her taxes. A few days later, she converts all of it to her Roth. The tax-free amount of the conversion is:

::TF = 100 * [ 6,000 / 6,000 ] which is 100%.

{| style="border: 1px solid darkgray;"
|+ '''Example 1'''
|-
||[[File:Backdoorroth2.jpg]]
|}

===Example 1a===
Ann made the contribution right before a holiday and forgot to convert the following business day. When she remembered it, the traditional IRA balance had &lt;i&gt;grown $60&lt;/i&gt;. So now she has a basis of $6,000 and the account value is $6,060. The tax-free amount of the conversion is:

::TF = 100 * [ 6,000 / 6,060 ] which is 99%.

If she converts it all, she will pay taxes on 1% of the conversion amount ($60). Although there is rounding in the percentage, she will be able to subtract her basis ($6,000) from the converted amount. There will be no basis left.

If she only converts the $6,000, 99% of the $6,000 basis ($5,940) will go with the converted amount and 1% of the basis ($60) will remain behind. So she would still need to pay taxes on the $60 that was converted but was not tax-free. Next year, she can convert the remaining $60 tax-free since it has a $60 basis, assuming there is no growth meanwhile. To keep things simple, she decides to convert all of it now.

|+ '''Example 1a'''
|-
||[[File:Backdoorroth3.jpg]]
|}

===Example 1b===
Ann made the contribution right before a holiday and forgot to convert the following business day. When she remembered it, the traditional IRA balance had &lt;i&gt;fallen $60&lt;/i&gt;. So now she has a basis of $6,000 and the account value is $5,940. The tax-free amount of the conversion is:

::TF = 100 * [ 6,000 / 5,940 ] which is 101%.

Because the tax-free percentage cannot be more than 100%, it resets to 100%. If she converts it all, she will pay no taxes on the conversion. What happens with the remaining basis ($60) is unclear. Leaving a dollar in the account and converting $5,939 ''might'' make it more likely she will retain $61 basis instead of losing $60 basis. This will be useful if she has future growth (or a deductible contribution of at least $61) in her traditional IRA because she will be able to convert $61 of it tax-free.

===Example 2===
Ben has $50,000 of deductible contributions and its growth in his traditional IRA, and has some taxable money he can use to pay most (but not all) of the conversion taxes. He also has a rollover IRA with $350,000 that contains only a 401k rolled over from a former employer and growth since the rollover. He is not eligible to contribute to a Roth directly but wants to do a backdoor Roth. It will be his first time for a backdoor Roth and he thinks he would also like to do one in the following year as he will convert half of the traditional IRA each year.

===Example 2a===
This year, before Ben starts the backdoor Roth, he rolls over the rollover IRA into a new 401k he has with a new employer.

Then he makes a nondeductible contribution of $6,000 to his traditional IRA, which brings the account value up to $56,000. Then he converts half of the IRA ($28,000), saving the other half for a Roth conversion in the following year. But by the end of the year, the $28,000 remaining in the traditional IRA grows another $4,000 giving the IRA a year-end value of $32,000. (Note that the Roth may have also grown the same amount.) The tax-free amount of the conversion is:

::TF = 100 * [ 6,000 / (32,000 + 0 + 28,000) ] = 100 * [ 6,000 / 60,000 ] which is 10%.

This makes 10% of his $28,000 conversion ($2,800) be tax free and $25,200 ($28,000 - $2,800) will be taxed. It also leaves $3,200 of his basis unused ($6,000 - $2,800).

{| style="border: 1px solid darkgray;"
|+ '''Example 2a'''
|-
||[[File:Backdoorroth5.jpg]]
|}

===Example 2b===
In the following year, if he converts before the account changes value again, Ben will withdraw the amount of $32,000, but this time he messes up and withholds 15% ($4,800) for federal taxes. This is a withdrawal amount that is NOT converted and there will be a 10% penalty on the pre-tax portion of the withheld amount, in additional to income tax, for early withdrawal if he is not yet 59.5. (Penalties are calculated on Form 5329.) He converts the remaining $27,200. A while later in the year, he makes a nondeductible contribution of $6,000 and converts it the following day. At the end of the year, his traditional IRAs are all empty. For this following year, there will be a tax-free amount of:

::TF = 100 * [(3,200 + 6,000) / (0 + 4,800 + 27,200 + 6,000)] = 100 * [ 9,200 / 38,000 ] which is 24.21%

This makes 24.21% of his $4,800 withdrawal ($1,162) and 24.21% of his $27,200 + $6,000 conversions ($8,038) be tax free. That leaves $3,638 of the withdrawal for tax withholding ($4,800 - 1,162) and $25,162 of the two conversions ($33,200 - 8,038) to be taxed. It also leaves no basis (or any other money) in his traditional IRA.

Note that the IRS is still holding the entire $4,800 to apply to his tax liability although part of that withholding is not taxed (that is, $1,162). That is just like the Roth holding the entire $33,200 ($27,200 + 6,000) even though some of it is not taxed (that is, $8,038).

===Example 3===
Chris is nearing retirement and wants to be ready to do some large Roth conversions on her 401k before starting Social Security. She plans to roll some of it into a traditional IRA right after she retires, but will leave it alone for this year and next. But to clean things up before then, she wants to 1) finish converting her small SEP-IRA from a former employer, 2) do a backdoor Roth each year while working, and 3) draw down an inherited traditional IRA from her mother. Her mother had been doing backdoor Roths but died before she had converted everything in her traditional IRA. 

Inherited traditional IRAs and inherited Roth IRAs can not receive new contributions nor be converted. They can only have withdrawals taken out. Although Chris had inherited half of her mother's traditional IRA and Roth IRA, the inherited &lt;i&gt;Roth&lt;/i&gt; IRA is irrelevant to this example. But the remaining basis in the inherited &lt;i&gt;traditional&lt;/i&gt; IRA still needs to be addressed (and is useful for account owners to know if they will be leaving basis in their traditional IRAs for their heirs).

===Example 3a===
Chris needs to process her own accounts separate from the inherited IRA. Her SEP-IRA only contains $15,000 and she wants to do a $5,000 backdoor Roth. She opens up a new traditional IRA account and makes the $5,000 nondeductible contribution to it. Between the two accounts, they total $20,000 and $5,000 is the basis. She converts the entire traditional IRA and $5,000 of the SEP-IRA, leaving only $10,000 in the SEP-IRA at the end of the year. To calculate the tax-free part of the $10,000 in Roth conversions:

::TF = 100 * [ 5,000 / (10,000 + 0 + 10,000) ] = 100 * [ 5,000 / 20,000 ] = which is 25%.

This makes 25% of her $10,000 conversion ($2,500) be tax-free and $7,500 ($10,000 - $2,500) will be taxed. It also leaves $2,500 of her basis ($5,000 - $2,500) left for a future year.

{| style="border: 1px solid darkgray;"
|+ '''Example 3a'''
|-
||[[File:Backdoorroth7.jpg]]
|}

===Example 3b===
The remaining account value of the inherited (traditional) IRA is $60,000 of which $20,000 is the remaining basis from the previous year. (When receiving the inherited IRA, if the deceased had high compensation, the executor or trustee of the estate should look at the deceased's past tax returns to see if there was remaining basis reported on Form 8606.) Withdrawals from an inherited IRA cannot be converted. In the current year, Chris withdraws $40,000 (more than her Required Minimum Distribution) and the tax-free percentage of the inherited IRA withdrawal is:

::TF = 100 * [ 20,000 / (20,000 + 40,000 + 0) ] = 100 * [ 20,000 / 60,000 ] = which is 33.33%.

This makes 33.33% of her $40,000 withdrawal ($13,333) be tax-free and $26,667 ($40,000 - $13,333) will be taxed. It also leaves $6,667 of her basis ($20,000 - $13,333) left for a future year.

{| style="border: 1px solid darkgray;"
|+ '''Example 3b'''
|-
||[[File:Backdoorroth8.jpg]]
|}

Chris will need to file two copies of Form 8606 for the year, one for her own accounts and one for the inherited IRA. They will maintain separate carry-over bases. If she is married, her spouse will also have to file a separate Form 8606 with a separate pro rata calculation, if needed.

===Using tax software===
To report a full backdoor Roth procedure in Turbo Tax (at least, and possibly in other software), it is often helpful to skip the tax software's default order of data entry, which asks you about income first, and IRA contributions later.&lt;ref name="crit"&gt;{{Forum post| p=4291809|title=Re: Wiki page UPGRADE: Backdoor Roth|date=31 December 2018|author=crit}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Enter your other income and wages as usual, but do NOT enter the 1099-R from your IRA distribution on your first pass. Instead, after entering other income, navigate manually to the IRA contribution section. You can do this by clicking on the tabs for 'Federal Taxes', then scroll down under 'Deductions and Credits' to the 'Retirement and Investments' section, and click on the 'Start' button for contributions. As noted above, in the backdoor process, you made a contribution to a traditional IRA, so that is what you report -- not a Roth contribution.&lt;ref name="crit" /&gt;

Once you have completed the contributions section, use the manual navigation again to go back to the income section, and now enter the information from the 1099R that reports the distribution from that traditional IRA. This step reports the conversion of the traditional IRA to Roth IRA. Be careful to enter exactly which boxes were checked for the distribution.&lt;ref name="crit" /&gt;

{{for|additional information|wikipedia:401(k)}}

A '''401(k)''' plan is a type of employer-sponsored defined-contribution retirement plan. Its name comes from section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/401| title=26 U.S. Code § 401 - Qualified pension, profit-sharing, and stock bonus plans| publisher=Legal Information Institute| accessdate=February 9, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also generally governed by Title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). 

A 401(k) allows eligible employees to elect to contribute some of their pay into the plan through [[payroll deductions]]. Contributions are pre-tax, meaning they are not included in the employee's taxable income, and some plans also have a [[#Roth 401(k)|Roth]] contribution option. Sometimes, employers will make [[employer matching contributions]] or other types of contributions into employees' accounts. Employees can invest their money in the investment choices offered by the plan, typically a selection of stock and bond-based mutual funds, and sometimes other less common investments too. 

Pre-tax money in the plan grows [[Tax_basics#Tax_deferral|tax-deferred]] and is taxable income when later withdrawn, and Roth growth and withdrawals are tax-free subject to some basic [[#Distributions|distribution]] requirements. There is a 10% penalty for taking withdrawals before age 59½, although there are many [[Early_withdrawal|exceptions]]. Pre-tax money is subject to [[Required Minimum Distribution|Required Minimum Distributions]] (RMDs) starting at age 73 or 75, unless you are still working for the employer. Money in a 401(k) can be left to heirs, and most non-spouse heirs will have to empty the account by the end of the 10th year after your death.

==Advantages==
* You get an immediate tax break, because contributions come out of your paycheck before taxes are withheld. Although you will later pay taxes on withdrawals, most people most of the time have a lower tax rate when retired than while working.
** If you think your future tax rate will be similar to or higher than your current tax rate, many plans offer a [[#Roth_401(k)|designated Roth account]], where contributions are taxable, but future growth and withdrawals are tax-free. The choice of pre-tax/traditional or Roth contributors can be a complex [[Traditional versus Roth|tax-planning decision]]. 
* Many employers will [[Employer matching contributions|match your contributions]] at least partially, for example 50 cents on the dollar for the first 6 percent of your salary you save. If an employer has "frozen" the company's defined benefit plan, the company may increase the company match in the 401(k) plan to compensate for the reduced defined plan benefit.
* Tax-deferred growth - meaning you do not pay taxes each year on capital gains, dividends, and other distributions. This feature makes your money grow [[Tax basics|faster]], gives you valuable space to hold [[Tax-efficient fund placement|tax-inefficient investments]], and lets you buy and sell investments for [[rebalancing]] or changing your portfolio without incurring capital gains tax.
* Contributions are deducted from your paycheck before you get access to the money. From a behavioral finance perspective, this reduces the risk you will spend money needed for retirement, and helps you build and maintain the habit of saving. 
* Historically, many 401(k) plans had high fees which made them inferior to [[IRA|IRAs]]. However, 401(k) fees have come down in recent decades, and many plans are competitive with IRAs. Some plans even offer funds with lower fees than IRAs (for example, "Institutional-class" funds) and/or unique investments (for example, a [[stable value fund]] or real estate fund) that may be valuable to certain investors. 
* When eligible to participate, you can normally contribute more to the 401(k) than to your IRA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/plan-participant-employee/retirement-topics-401k-and-profit-sharing-plan-contribution-limits| title=Retirement topics: 401(k) and profit-sharing plan contribution limits| publisher=IRS| accessdate=January 9, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Contributions made to a 401(k) qualify for the Retirement Savings Contributions Credit ([[Saver's credit|Saver's Credit]]) if you meet the filing and income requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/publications/p571| title=Publication 571, Tax-Sheltered Annuity Plans (403(b) Plans)| publisher=IRS| accessdate=January 9, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Especially if the plan is governed by [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employee_Retirement_Income_Security_Act_of_1974 ERISA], money gets a high degree of [[asset protection]] at the federal level. Money in ERISA plans cannot taken by a creditor, even if they successfully sue you and get a judgment, and if you declare bankruptcy you get to keep money in the plan.
* [[Estate planning]] benefits - money can be left to heirs easily via designated beneficiaries (avoiding probate), and non-spouse heirs generally get an additional [[Stretch IRA|10 years]] of tax-deferred or tax-free growth before they have to empty the account.

==Disadvantages==
* Plans are generally not designed to allow access to funds before age 59½ without paying taxes and a 10% penalty.
* The employer chooses the available funds. They may be better (institutional shares) than funds available in personal accounts, or worse (high-cost funds), and they may or may not fit well within your investing plan. (You may have greater fund selection if the plan has a [[Self directed brokerage account]].)
* The plan may only offer funds with embedded fees, and/or charge fees on top of what is charged by the funds. Even seemingly small fees significantly erode long-term performance.
* The employer may change the fund selection, fees, or plan rules at any time.
* Employer contributions may not become ''vested'' (that is, become the property of the employee) until a certain number of years have passed.
* The plans are not insured by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC).

==Contributions==

A 401(k) plan is only required to offer a pre-tax (also known as a "traditional") account, but many plans also offer [[#Roth_401(k)|Roth 401(k)]] and/or [[#After-tax_401(k)|After-tax 401(k)]] accounts. You can only make these three types of regular contributions through direct payroll deductions. 

Pre-tax and Roth sub-accounts share an annual contribution limit, known as the ''elective deferral limit.'' If you are age 50 or older, you get an additional ''catch-up contribution'' limit, which now depends on your age.  Catch-up contributions for 2026 must be made to a Roth 401(k) if the employee's 2025 wages exceeded $150,000. These limits are shown in the following table:

{{Retirement Plan Contribution Limits}}
Employees can generally contribute up to 100% of their wages as elective deferrals. Contributions are included as wages subject to withholding for Social Security and Medicare taxes. In addition, your employer must report the elective contributions as wages subject to federal unemployment taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc424| title=Topic no. 424, 401(k) plans| publisher=IRS| accessdate=January 9, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, there is an overall plan contribution limit, sometimes called the ''Section 415(c) limit'', which as of 2026 is '''$72,000''', not including catch-up contributions. This limit applies to all contributions into the plan, including:

*employee elective deferrals
*employer contributions (matching, profit-sharing, etc.)
*employee after-tax contributions
*[[#Nonelective_contributions|nonelective contributions]]

===Automatic enrollment and contributions===

Employers may configure their plans to automatically enroll eligible employees, unless that employee opts out. You can normally withdraw automatic enrollment contributions penalty free, if you request the withdrawal within 90 days of the first deferral and completed within 6 months of the plan year in which they began. A safe harbor for nondiscrimination testing is available if plans have:
# Initial deferrals of at least 3% of pay, increasing annually by 1% to a number between 6% and 10% of pay,
# Either
## An employer match of 100% on the first 1% and 50% on the next 5% of pay, or
## A 3% nonelective contribution,
# 100% vesting after two years, 
# Default investment selections satisfying Department of Labor regulations, and
# Annual notice to all employees regarding their right to opt out or change the automatic provisions.
Provided the notice requirement is met, and the default investments satisfy Department of Labor regulations, automatic enrollment will be governed by ERISA and preempt any contradictory state laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://institutional.vanguard.com/insights-and-research/perspective/the-power-of-autoenrollment.html| title=The power of autoenrollment| publisher=Vanguard| accessdate=January 9, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Employer match===
{{Main|Employer matching contributions}}

Employers sometimes offer matching contributions when you contribute to pre-tax or Roth accounts. The matching calculation is typically a percentage of employee contributions up to a certain percentage of your salary (for example, 50% of contributions up to 6% of your salary). Until recently, all employer matching contributions went into the pre-tax account regardless of whether the employee's contributions are pre-tax or Roth. However, as of 2022 the SECURE Act 2.0 now allows employers to offer Roth matches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.kitces.com/blog/secure-act-2-omnibus-2022-hr-2954-rmd-75-529-roth-rollover-increase-qcd-student-loan-match/| title=SECURE Act 2.0: Later RMDs, 529-To-Roth Rollovers, And Other Tax Planning Opportunities| publisher=Kitces Nerd's Eye View| author=Jeffrey Levine|date=December 28, 2022|accessdate=January 9, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any Roth matches are taxable income to the employee and must be immediately vested. Employers do not generally match contributions to an after-tax account, but read your plan rules for details.

Getting an employer match should be a top [[Prioritizing investments|financial priority]], as it is like free money, not to mention  money that automatically gets tax-advantaged growth, and asset protection and estate planning benefits.

===Nonelective contributions===

Employers can make certain other contributions not elected by the employees, such as profit sharing contributions. Before 2007, these contributions had to become vested on or faster than either (a) 20% each year from years 3-7 of service or (b) 100% after 5 years of service. Contributions made in and since 2007 must become vested on or faster than either (a) 20% each year from years 2-6 of service or (b) 100% after 3 years of service (with an delayed effective date for collectively bargained plans). 

===Multiple plans===

If you have more than one job, the Section 415(c) plan applies to each plan you have access to as long as the employers are ''unrelated'', meaning that the large-share owners are not the same person or close family members. If a set of businesses are owned by closely related people, the IRS considers them part of a ''controlled group'', and the Section 415(c) limit applies to all plans within this group. Controlled group rules can be very complex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.employeefiduciary.com/blog/is-your-company-part-of-a-controlled-group-you-need-to-know-or-risk-401k-plan-disqualification| title=Is Your Company Part of a Controlled Group?  You Need to Know or Risk 401(k) Plan Disqualification| publisher=Employee Fiduciary| author=Eric Droblyen|date=July 30, 2025|accessdate=September 25, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

You get only one elective deferral limit per year, regardless of how many plans you may have access to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.whitecoatinvestor.com/multiple-401k|title=Multiple 401(k) Rules – What to Do with Multiple 401(k) Accounts|author=Dr. Jim Dahle|date=July 21, 2020|accessdate=September 25, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investments==

401(k) plans only offer a set of investments selected by the plan provider, usually in the range of one to several dozen options. Choices typically including a selection of stock and bond [[mutual fund|mutual funds]] and maybe other investments. Historically, employer plans have commonly had high fees, both inside the funds and sometimes added on top of the fund expenses. However, 401(k) plans have come down in recent decades, especially at larger employers. Some plans may even offer better investments than can be purchased inside an [[IRA]] or [[Taxable account|brokerage]] account, such as "institutional-class" funds, a [[stable value fund]], private investments, and others. 

When choosing funds in a 401(k), pay close attention to each investment's [[Expense ratios|expense ratio]]. The data are overwhelming that low-fee [[Index fund|index funds]] and other passive investments statistically outperform high-fee actively-managed funds in the long run.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.whitecoatinvestor.com/managers-dont-beat-markets/|title=Managers Don’t Beat Markets (Why Index Funds Are the Best Way to Invest in the Stock Market)|author=Dr. Jim Dahle|date=March 18, 2025|accessdate=September 25, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt; Look for funds with expense ratios in the range of 0.10% or less. 

Many funds are not necessary to build a good portfolio; in fact, simpler portfolios tend to be better. A great portfolio can be built with just [[Three-fund portfolio|three funds]]. If you have retirement money saved in other places besides the 401(k) ([[IRA|IRAs]], a spouse's [[Employer retirement plans overview|employer plan]], taxable brokerage account, etc.) then you can build a portfolio around a 401(k) with just one good fund. If your plan has no good fund options, see: [[#Expensive_or_mediocre_choices|Expensive or mediocre choices]] below.

Some plans offer a [[Self directed brokerage account|Self-Directed Brokerage Account]] (SDBA) which lets you invest in a wider range of investments. If your plan does not offer any good mutual funds, a SDBA can be used to purchase low-cost [[Exchange-traded fund|exchange-traded funds]] (ETFs). The fee savings of the investments should be weighed against the costs associated with the SDBA. 

===Target retirement funds===
{{See also|Approximating Vanguard target date funds}}

The default option for employer provider plans is to place your contributions and employer matches into a [[Target date retirement funds|target date retirement fund]].

Investors have increased their allocation to target retirement funds over time. Vanguard reports data for the employer provided funds it manages in annual ''"How America Saves"'' studies. Among the findings:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://institutional.vanguard.com/VGApp/iip/site/institutional/clientsolutions/dc/howamericasaves| title=How America Saves 2013| publisher=Vanguard Institutional}}{{dead link}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=June 2025|title=How America Saves 2025|url=https://institutional.vanguard.com/content/dam/inst/iig-transformation/insights/pdf/2025/has/2025_How_America_Saves.pdf|website=Vanguard Institutional}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Employee account balance holdings of target retirement funds increased from a 3% allocation in 2006 to a 63% allocation in 2024.
* Employee contributions to target retirement funds increased from 4% in 2006 to 85% allocation in 2024.
* In 2012, employees 25 years old and younger held 68% of their account balances in target retirement funds.
* In 2012, employees with less than 10,000 dollars in their plans held 56% of their account balances in target retirement funds.
* Employees using target date target-date funds increased from 69% in 2015 to 84% in 2024.

===Employer stock===

Some plans offer employer stock as an investment option, or contribute the employer match in the form of employer stock. Plans offering employer stock must offer at least three diversified investment options with materially different risk and return characteristics. They must allow you to diversify elective deferral contributions immediately (at least quarterly), and also allow you to diversify employer contributions after three years of service.

Because you already have plenty of risk tied with the performance of your employer, keeping your 401(k) contributions in employer stock is not recommended; in contrast, diversifying out of or even complete avoiding employer stock in your 401(k) is strongly recommended. However, if you hold employer stock with a low basis and you are considering a lump sum distribution rollover of plan assets, see [[Net unrealized appreciation]].

==Nondiscrimination==

Under ERISA, retirement plans including 401(k) plans are not allowed to discriminate in favor of [[Highly compensated employee |highly compensated employees]]. They can make corrections by returning the excess contributions to those highly compensated employees within a specified period of time after the plan year ends. The returned funds are taxable income when received. The time period varies based on other features of the plan, generally from 2.5 to 6 months. If not returned timely by the employer, the employee will also be subject to an additional 10% excise tax.

This rule is waived for plans which meet certain safe harbors. Among other attributes, these safe harbor plans are characterized by certain minimum employer contribution rates as well as more favorable vesting provisions for employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Safe Harbor 401k|url= https://www.investopedia.com/safe-harbor-401k-plan-8620915|publisher=Investopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roth 401(k)==
{{See also|Traditional versus Roth}}

An employer may also elect to make Roth 401(k) contributions available; such an account is known as a '''designated Roth account'''. They are the 401(k) equivalent of [[Roth IRA]] contributions, and if the 401(k) is rolled over they can be rolled directly to a Roth IRA or another Roth 401(k). These are normally administered as a sub-account of the employee's 401(k) account. Both Roth and regular contributions are subject to the same contribution limit. Starting in 2024 and later years, RMDs are no longer required from designated Roth 401(k) and 403(b) accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/retirement-plan-and-ira-required-minimum-distributions-faqs#:~:text=Designated%20Roth%20accounts%20in%20a,required%20from%20designated%20Roth%20accounts | title= Retirement plan and IRA Required Minimum Distributions FAQs | publisher=Internal Revenue Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Distributions===

When taking a distribution directly from a designated Roth account (that is, not rolling it over into another account), special rules apply. The account becomes fully qualified when you have met the five-year holding period for the account,&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The five-year holding period for a designated Roth account begins on the first day of the taxable year you make your first contribution to that specific account. It does not matter how long you have had a Roth IRA or any other designated Roth account. This is one of several "five-year rules" that apply to Roth accounts.&lt;/ref&gt; and are either age 59½ or disabled. If the account is not fully qualified, any distributions are ''pro-rata'' - that is, in equal proportions from the basis (contributions) and earnings within the account. The following table summarizes the distribution rules for the simpler case when the account does not contain any In-Plan Roth Rollovers (IRRs):

{| class="wikitable collapsible" width=800px
|-
!  width=500px | 
!  width=500px | Under age 59½, no [[Early withdrawal|exception]]
!  width=500px | Under age 59½, [[Early withdrawal|exception]] other than disability

|-
| colspan="4" |
|-
! Five year holding period ''met''
| rowspan="2" style="background:#F99;vertical-align:middle;text-align:center;" | Pro-rata: tax and penalty on earnings, basis tax- and penalty-free
| rowspan="2" style="background:#FFFF90;vertical-align:middle;text-align:center;" | Pro-rata: only tax on earnings
| style="background:#9F9;vertical-align:middle;text-align:center;" | Fully qualified
|-
! Five year holding period ''not met''
| style="background:#FFFF90;vertical-align:middle;text-align:center;" | Pro-rata: only tax on earnings
|-
|}

When the account contains IRRs, the rules are very complex,&lt;ref&gt;{{forum link| t=460229| title=&lt;nowiki&gt;[Wiki] Proposed new pages - Rule of 55, Early Withdrawal [and now "Retirement account at a former employer"]&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; and legal ambiguity exists. IRRs generally belong in the "basis" category with respect to the above pro-rata calculation, but the exact ordering between direct contributions and IRRs is determined by the plan rules. To make matters worse, plans are generally not required to populate Box 10 of [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1099r.pdf Form 1099-R] unless the distribution is taken under a [[Substantially equal periodic payments|SEPP]]. 

In either case, if the designed Roth account is not qualified, you are generally better off to first roll the money out into a Roth IRA and then take withdrawals from the Roth IRA, because Roth IRA distributions always order contributions and conversions/rollovers before earnings. This strategy also avoids the complex and error-prone calculations for distributions from the designated Roth account.

==After-tax 401(k)==
{{main|After-tax 401(k)}}

An employer may also allow you to make After-tax 401(k) contributions. These are the 401(k) equivalent of [[Non-deductible traditional IRA |non-deductible traditional IRA]] contributions, and if the 401(k) is rolled over they can be rolled directly to a Roth IRA. These are normally administered as a sub-account of the employee's 401(k) account. IRS rules allow employees to contribute up to 100% of compensation into an after-tax 401(k), up to the overall Section 415(c) limit for the plan. Employers usually limit after-tax contributions to a certain percentage of salary, but the limit is still often much higher than for pre-tax or Roth accounts. 

IRC Section 415(c)(1)(A) sets the total contribution limit for both employee and employer contributions to a 401(k), and is summarized in [https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/plan-participant-employee/retirement-topics-403b-contribution-limits Retirement Topics 403b Contribution Limits]. Therefore, the after-tax contribution limit is the remaining amount allowed after all employee and employer contributions. And for most people that can afford to contribute, it would allow them to save nearly twice as much money in tax-advantaged space as the combination of elective deferrals and employer contributions.

Just like [[non-deductible traditional IRA]] contributions, earnings are taxed upon withdrawal or conversion at ordinary income rates. Therefore, an after-tax 401(k) account is not great on its own; it's usually better to invest after-tax money in a [[taxable account]], so future growth will be taxed at lower long-term capital gains rates. But, an after-tax 401(k) is useful as an intermediary account, because funds can be rolled over into a [[#Roth_401(k)|Roth sub-account]] or out into a [[Roth IRA]], if the plan allows in-plan Roth rollovers or [[#In-service_distribution|in-service distributions]]. During either rollover, the basis (contributions) rolls over tax-free, and only the growth is taxable. If you are able to roll after-tax 401(k) money into a Roth account quickly, the growth will be minimal, and the overall transaction has the net effect of a Roth contribution. This process is called the [[Mega-backdoor Roth]]. For 401(k) plans with the necessary features, this process allows large Roth contributions in excess of the normal 401(k) limits.

==Plan loans==

Most major companies also offer a loan provision on their 401(k) plans that let you borrow against your account and repay yourself with interest. Restrictions will vary by company but most let you withdraw no more than 50 percent of your vested account value as a loan. You then repay the loan with interest, through deductions taken directly from your paychecks. You must repay the loan within five years unless you use it to buy your main home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/plan-sponsor/401k-resource-guide-plan-sponsors-general-distribution-rules| title=401k Resource Guide Plan Sponsors General Distribution Rules| publisher=IRS| accessdate=January 9, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to tax year 2018, you had a 60-day window on employment termination, to repay a 401(k) loan balance or rollover the loan balance to an eligible retirement account, in order to avoid the loan balance from being treated as a distribution. The 2017 tax reform (Tax Cuts and Jobs Act) extended the loan repayment and rollover window to the tax filing deadline (including the tax filing extension, if applicable) for tax years 2018 and later. Effectively, this increases the time that you have, to repay or rollover the loan balance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://sponsor.fidelity.com/bin-public/06_PSW_Website/documents/taxlawchanged-table.pdf| title=Recent Changes in Tax Laws Affect Qualified Retirement Plans and Health &amp; Welfare Benefits| publisher=Fidelity}}{{dead link}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.creditkarma.com/tax/i/401k-tax-reform-loan-repay| title=401(k) Tax Reform Equals More Time to Repay 401(k) Loans| publisher=Credit Karma| accessdate=January 9, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Employer plans may allow early withdrawals under some circumstances, but whether the 10% early withdrawal penalty applies is governed by IRS rules. Plans are only required to allow withdrawals when you separate from service, become disabled, die, for [[Required Minimum Distribution|RMDs]], or if/when the plan terminates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.employeefiduciary.com/blog/401k-distribution-rules-frequently-asked-questions| title=401(k) Distribution Rules: Frequently Asked Questions for Employers and Employees| publisher=Employee Fiduciary| author=Eric Droblyen| date=May 6, 2025 |accessdate=September 1, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, many plans do not allow you to withdraw after you turn 59½ if you are still working, even though such withdrawals would be penalty-free. 

Early withdrawal penalties apply to withdrawals before you are age 59½ unless one of the exceptions apply. Some common exceptions are listed below. A complete list is available on the [[Early withdrawal|main page]].

*[[Rule of 55]] - if you separate from your employer in or after the year you turn 55
*A series of payments under a [[Substantially equal periodic payments|Substantially Equal Periodic Payments]] (SEPP) plan, useful for [[early retirement]]
*Qualified reservist distributions&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Qualified reservist distributions may be made to military reservists called up for at least 180 days, with no early withdrawal penalty. Reservists may re-contribute the amount of the qualified reservist distribution to an IRA in the 2 year period beginning the day after the end of their active duty. The extension of the repayment and rollover window is applicable to [[403(b)]] and [[457(b)]] plans, in addition to 401(k) plans.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Medical expenses
*Total and permanent disability
*Terminal illness
*Death

===Hardship distributions===
 
Plans ''may'', but are not required to, allow employees to withdraw money from plans for financial hardships, defined as an immediate and heavy financial need, and you are only allowed to withdraw the amount necessary to satisfy that need.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/plan-participant-employee/retirement-topics-hardship-distributions| title=Retirement topics - Hardship distributions| publisher=IRS| accessdate=August 27, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes hardships of your beneficiary under the plan.. Such withdrawals ''may be'' subject to early withdrawal penalties if one of the exceptions does not apply. 

==In-service distribution==
An '''in-service distribution''', also known as an in-service withdrawal or in-service rollover, is when a participant takes a rollover distribution from the plan while still employed at the company that is offering the plan.

IRS rules do not permit this for employees age 59½ or younger, for their elective employee pretax or Roth contributions; for participants age 59½ or older, a plan ''may'' allow it. A plan may, however, allow for in-service distributions of the employer matching contributions and of the employee's [[401(k)#After-tax_401.28k.29|after-tax 401(k)]] contributions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://thefinancebuff.com/in-service-withdrawal-the-law-and-the-plan-rules.html| title=In-Service Withdrawal: The Law and The Plan Rules| publisher=The Finance Buff| date=February 1, 2011| accessdate=January 9, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{forum link| t=50493 |title=In-service 401(k) rollover to IRA (under 40, still employed)| date=February 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rollovers==
{{Main|Retirement account at a former employer}}
{{See also|IRA rollovers and transfers}}

When your employment ends, you have the following options with the 401(k) at your previous employer. The [[Retirement account at a former employer|main article]] has more detail and discusses some less common situations. 

===Roll the money into your new employer's plan===

Potential advantages:
*Simplicity - you have one less account to keep track of, and [[rebalancing]] is easier
*Some employer plans have better investments than you can get in an IRA, or investments that could be uniquely valuable. See: [[Retirement_account_at_a_former_employer#Investments_in_employer_plans|Investments in employer plans]]
*Easier access:
**If you retire in the year you turn 55, you can access the money penalty-free by way of the [[Rule of 55]]
**If the new employer's plan has a plan loan feature, you can use this feature with rolled in money (whereas plan loans from accounts at a former employer are not allowed)
*If you work past [[Required Minimum Distribution]] (RMD) age, money in the new employer's plan is exempt from RMDs

Potential disadvantages:
*The new employer's plan may have undesirable fees and/or investment choices that are not ideal

===Roll the money into an IRA===

Potential advantages:
*It is easy to find [[IRA|IRAs]] with great investment choices and low fees
*The account is entirely under your control, so you avoid potential complications related to your employer, such as them adding fees or changing investment options, or problems with your account such as if the employer goes out of business.
*Unlike employer plans, you can withdraw money from an IRA at any time (although whether these withdrawals are subject to penalties and additional taxes is determined by [[Early withdrawal|IRS rules]]). 
**Although not common, if you want the ability to do [[Roth conversion|Roth conversions]] and your employer's plan does not allow In-Plan Roth Rollovers (IRRs), leaving pre-tax money in an IRA will allow this.
**The [[Roth IRA]] distribution rules are generally more favorable for early distributions than for designated Roth accounts, if you want to [[Early retirement|retire early]] or need money in an emergency.

Potential disadvantages:
*Any pre-tax money in a [[traditional IRA]] interferes with the [[Backdoor Roth IRA]] process. If you are a higher earner who needs to use the Backdoor Roth IRA process to contribute to a Roth IRA, this would make those contributions impossible.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;You could still execute the Backdoor Roth IRA process, but it would act more like a taxable [[Roth conversion]], which is probably not desirable if you are adding that taxable income on top of a high earned income.&lt;/ref&gt; This is ''not'' an issue for Roth money, as [[Roth IRA]] balances are not included in the pro-rata calculation.
*Money in an IRA foregoes potential benefits from an employer plan, such as Rule of 55, plan loans (if your employer's plan has this feature), and the suspension of RMDs if you work past RMD age. Whether these features are valuable to you depends on your individual situation.
*Money in an IRA generally gets less [[asset protection]] than money in an employer plan. Money in a Rollover IRA, if not commingled with other IRA money and with no direct contributions made into it, gets unlimited protection from bankruptcy at the federal level. Protection of an IRA against general creditor claims is at the state level, with some states offering limited or no protection. Money in an [[ERISA]] employer plan gets unlimited federal protection from both bankruptcy and creditor claims.
*There are plenty of unscrupulous salespeople (many of whom call themselves "financial advisors") who would love to sell you poor-quality fee-laden and/or high-risk investments in an IRA, such as loaded mutual funds, annuities, permanent life insurance, private investments, and others. The investment choices in employer plans, while possibly not ideal, at least protect against predatory salespeople and scams.

===Leave the money in the former employer's plan===

Potential advantages:
*If the new employer's plan is not good (or doesn't accept incoming rollovers) and you don't want to roll the money out into an IRA (for example, if you want to make Backdoor Roth IRA contributions), leaving money in the former employer's plan may be the best option
*If the plan has [[Retirement_account_at_a_former_employer#Investments_in_employer_plans|desirable investments]] compared to the new employer's plan or an IRA, it could be a benefit to leave the money inside

Potential disadvantages:
*You have one more account to keep track of and potentially forget about, and rebalancing is more difficult
*The former employer can forcibly roll money out of the plan into an IRA if the balance is less than $7,000, or forcibly distribute it if less than $1,000
*The former employer's plan may have undesirable fees and/or investment choices that are not ideal
*You cannot access the money by way of the Rule of 55 or plan loans after you separate
*The account will be subject to RMDs even if you are still working for your new employer at RMD age
*Although not common, investors sometimes have issues getting access to money in a former employer's plan, for example if the employer is bought out, goes out of business, etc.

===Take a distribution as cash===

This is usually advisable only if you need the money immediately and have no other sources to draw from, including taking a loan at reasonable terms. You will pay a 10% early distribution penalty if an [[Early withdrawal|exception]] does not apply. You will also owe taxes on the distribution, and Roth money withdrawn early may generate taxes that you would not pay if you waited until age 59½. In addition to these immediate taxes and penalties, you also forego the future benefits of retirement accounts, such as tax-deferred or tax-free growth, asset protection, and [[estate planning]] benefits.

==Involuntary cash out distributions==

A defined contribution plan may involuntarily cash out, also described as force out, the accounts of ex-employee participants with a balance of $7,000 or less.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/publications/p560| title=Publication 560 (2024), Retirement Plans for Small Business| publisher=IRS| accessdate=September 2, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt; This amount was increased from $5,000 in the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SECURE_2.0_Act SECURE 2.0 Act], effective January 1, 2024.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://keitercpa.com/blog/benefit-plan-5-reasons-leverage-secure-2-0-cashout-change/| title=Benefit Plan Insights: 5 Reasons to Leverage SECURE 2.0 Act’s Cashout Limit Change| publisher=Keiter CPAs| author=Rachel Gonner| date=April 18, 2024| accessdate=September 2, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the balance is between $1,000 and $7,000, then the employer must notify the participant and must provide for the automatic rollover to an [[IRA]] or annuity, unless the participant chooses otherwise. Balances of less than $1,000 may be distributed as cash/check to the participant; this will result in an [[401(k)#Early_withdrawals_and_loans|early withdrawal]] penalty and a taxable event.

A 401(k) plan is not ''required'' to make these distributions, but they ''may'', and many plans do so to reduce administrative costs of running the plans. Therefore, if you have 401(k) balances of $7,000 or less with former employers you should know the rules of your former plan(s) so you can manage your accounts successfully. If you have balances of $1,000 or less you must take extra care to monitor your accounts to ensure that they are not cashed out.

The best way to ensure a small-balance account is handled according to your investment goals is to roll the balance over to an IRA or to a new defined contribution plan (if applicable and if the plan accepts rollovers).

==Required Minimum Distributions==
{{Main|Required Minimum Distribution}}

You must begin making distributions from a traditional 401(k) at least no later than the year after the year you turn 73 unless you are still employed at the company sponsoring the 401(k) plan. The minimum RMD age increases to 75 in 2033. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://natlawreview.com/article/secure-20-series-part-3-retirement-plan-required-minimum-distribution-age-to?amp | title= SECURE 2.0 Series Part 3: Retirement Plan Required Minimum Distribution Age to Increase to 75 | publisher=National Law Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of the distribution is based on life expectancy according to the relevant factors from the [[IRA Distribution Tables | appropriate IRS tables]]. The only exception to minimum distribution is for people still working once they reach that age, and the exception only applies to the current plan they are participating in. There is a penalty for failing to make the minimum distribution. The penalty is 25% of the amount that should have been distributed, reduced to 10% if corrected within two years. Prior to 2024, RMDs were also required in Roth 401(k)s. Starting in 2024 and later years, RMDs are no longer required from designated Roth 401(k) and 403(b) accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/retirement-plan-and-ira-required-minimum-distributions-faqs#:~:text=Designated%20Roth%20accounts%20in%20a,required%20from%20designated%20Roth%20accounts | title= Retirement plan and IRA Required Minimum Distributions FAQs | publisher=Internal Revenue Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beneficiaries==

If you die while holding the plan, your designated beneficiaries may rollover their inherited balance to an IRA, which will be treated as an inherited IRA.

===Successor beneficiaries===
If the designated beneficiary stays in the plan, successor beneficiaries of the designated beneficiary may not rollover an inherited balance to an IRA, per Sec 402(c)(11). A 401(k) plan ''may'', however, choose to allow successor beneficiaries to stay in the plan, and take required minimum distribution requirements using the same schedule that the original designated beneficiary was using.&lt;ref&gt;{{forum link|p=2214160|title=TSP Beneficiary Account and Tax Burden to Successors|author=Alan S|date=October 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Expensive or mediocre choices==
Even in a bad 401(k), you should contribute up to the company match. Choose the lowest-cost funds; many bad 401(k)s have a few lower-cost funds. If you are eligible, additional contributions should usually go into a Roth or Traditional IRA. But unless your 401(k) is very bad and you expect to stay a very long time with the same employer, investing unmatched money in the 401(k) is likely to be better than taxable investing, because you can roll over your 401(k) to a low-cost IRA when you leave.

A reasonable rule-of-thumb is to consider investing in a taxable account if the product of the extra costs and the number of years you will stay in the plan exceeds one and a half times your combined federal and state tax rates on qualified dividends over your working career. That is, if you pay 1.70% expenses rather than 0.20%, and you pay 15% federal tax on qualified dividends, plus 5% state tax, you should still invest in the plan unless you are reasonably certain that you will stay with the employer for more than 20 years for a net loss of 30% (actually 26% because of compounding). If you pay no state tax, you should still invest in the plan unless you are reasonably certain you will stay more than 15 years.

The reason for the rule of thumb is that a long-term investment, even in a tax-efficient stock fund, is likely to lose more than your tax rate to taxes. You will pay tax every year on the dividends, continue to pay that tax after you leave the employer, and then pay capital-gains tax on most of the investment value when you sell the fund over the course of your retirement. (And if you retire in a 15% tax bracket and thus pay no capital gains on the fund sale, the lower tax bracket will also reduce the tax due on withdrawals from a 401(K), for a comparable tax savings.)&lt;ref group="note"&gt;[https://thefinancebuff.com/alternatives-to-a-high-cost-401k-or-403b-plan.html Alternatives to a High Cost 401(k) Or 403(b) Plan] at [https://thefinancebuff.com TheFinanceBuff.com] contains a spreadsheet which can be used to compare alternatives for your situation (July 23, 2008). The spreadsheet approximately agrees with the rule-of-thumb estimates for the common situation in which you have 20-30 years with the employer and then average about another 10 years in retirement.&lt;/ref&gt;

Now, before you consider forgoing your 401(k), you may want to talk to the human resources department to see if they can improve the 401(k) plan. You may want to suggest a low-cost plan like Employee Fiduciary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.employeefiduciary.com/| title=401(k) Plans for Small Businesses| publisher=Employee Fiduciary| accessdate=January 9, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt; You can find a sample letter to the human resources department at {{forum link| t=7573| title=401(k) links and suggestions}}. Keep in mind that the employer likely cares more about the cost of running the 401(k) plan than the expense ratios that the employees have to live with. For this reason, it is not a good idea to stress the problem with the expense ratios too much. (See [[How to campaign for a better 401(k) plan]] for more details, as well as [https://thefinancebuff.com/alternatives-to-a-high-cost-401k-or-403b-plan.html Alternatives to a High Cost 401(k) Or 403(b) Plan] for more guidance).

==Employer administration==
===Investment policy statements===
Employers are expected to have investment policy statements for the plan, governing the process by which investment selections are chosen and monitored on an ongoing basis.

===Timing of contributions===
Contributions deferred from an employee's pay must be contributed to the 401(k) plan and allocated to your account "as of the earliest date" the deferrals can be segregated from the employer's assets. According to Department of Labor regulation 2510.3-102, the "earliest date" is the earlier of (1) the first date reasonably practicable on an ongoing basis based on the routine processing of the payroll information, transmittal of data to the plan provider and processing by the provider or (2) the 15th business day of the month following the month in which the contribution was withheld from the employee's pay. Employers are violating ERISA and subject to 15% tax on the deemed interest when failing to contribute timely.

===Plan financial reports===
Plan financial reports are filed on form 5500, 5500-C or 5500-R. Some of the information from these reports must be made available to employees, often on the company intranet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://institutional.vanguard.com/iam/pdf/RBA_052008_01.pdf| title=Regulatory Brief: Update on Plan Fee Disclosure| publisher=Vanguard| date=May 2008| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110818142722/https://institutional.vanguard.com/iam/pdf/RBA_052008_01.pdf| archive-date=August 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{for|additional information|wikipedia:403(b)}}

The '''403(b)''' is a tax deferred, defined contribution plan available to [[403b plans for K-12 public school district employees|employees of educational institutions such as public school districts]] and certain (Internal Revenue Code section) 501(c)(3) non-profit groups, which include colleges, universities, hospitals, charities and the clergy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irs.gov/publications/p571/index.html  IRS Publication 571 Tax-Sheltered Annuity Plans(403(b)Plans)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plan basics==
Contributions to a 403(b) plan are tax-deductible, and any earnings accumulate tax-free until withdrawals are made. Withdrawals are taxed at ordinary income rates, and a 10% penalty tax is assessed on withdrawals made prior to the age of 59 ½.  In 2026, catch-up contributions must be made to a Roth account if the employee's 2025 salary was more than $150,000.

Employees may contribute up to 100% of their salaries, subject to the following limits:

{{Retirement Plan Contribution Limits}}
===Roth 403(b)===

Beginning in 2006, 403(b) plans have been allowed the option of providing a Roth 403(b).  The Roth 403(b) allows individuals to contribute after-tax dollars to grow tax free and, generally, not be taxed upon withdrawal.&lt;ref group="note"&gt; A qualified Roth 403(b) distribution is generally a distribution that is made after a 5-taxable-year period of participation and is either:
#made on or after the date you attain age 59½
#made after your death, or
#attributable to your being disabled.
When you roll over a distribution from a designated Roth account to a Roth IRA, the period that the rolled-over funds were in the designated Roth account '''does not count''' toward the 5-taxable-year period for determining qualified distributions from the Roth IRA. However, if you had contributed to any Roth IRA in a prior year, the 5-taxable-year period for determining qualified distributions from a Roth IRA is measured from the earlier contribution. So, if the earlier contribution was made more than 5 years ago and you are over 59 ½ a distribution of amounts attributable to a rollover contribution from a designated Roth account would be a qualified distribution from the Roth IRA.&lt;br&gt;
If you take a distribution from your designated Roth account before the end of the 5-taxable-year period, it is a nonqualified distribution. You must include the earnings portion of the nonqualified distribution in gross income. However, the basis (or contributions) portion of the nonqualified distribution is not included in gross income. The basis portion of the distribution is determined by multiplying the amount of the nonqualified distribution by the ratio of designated Roth contributions to the total designated Roth account balance.&lt;br&gt; 
For example, if a nonqualified distribution of $5,000 is made from your designated Roth account when the account consists of $9,400 of designated Roth contributions and $600 of earnings, the distribution consists of $4,700 of designated Roth contributions (that are not includible in your gross income) and $300 of earnings (that are includible in your gross income). See [http://www.irs.gov/Retirement-Plans/Retirement-Plans-FAQs-on-Designated-Roth-Accounts#distns FAQ's on Designated Roth Accounts], IRS. &lt;/ref&gt;
If the plan contains a Roth option, an employee can direct 403(b) contributions to a regular 403(b), a Roth 403(b), or some combination of the two plans; the total contribution cannot exceed the annual contribution limit.&lt;ref name="FAQ"&gt;[http://www.403bwise.com/participants/getwise_faq.html 403bwise FAQ]&lt;/ref&gt;

A Roth 403(b) is no longer subject to required minimum distributions during the owner's lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irs.gov/Retirement-Plans/Retirement-Plans-FAQs-regarding-Required-Minimum-Distributions Retirement Plans FAQs regarding Required Minimum Distributions], IRS &lt;/ref&gt;

A Roth 403(b) may be attractive under the following circumstances:
* If you expect your tax rate in retirement will be higher than it had been during the years you contributed.
* If you are young and want to use a long investment horizon to accumulate tax-free earnings under a Roth feature.
* If you are a highly compensated individual who would like to have a pool of tax-free money to draw upon after retirement, and who are not eligible for Roth IRAs due to the income limitations.
* If you want to leave tax-free money to heirs.

===Fifteen year rule===

Employees with 15 or more years of service with public school systems, hospitals, home health service agencies, health and welfare agencies, churches, or convention or associations of churches may be able to qualify for a Salary Reduction Catch-Up.  This option is only available to those whose prior contributions have averaged less than $5,000 per year.  If this qualification is met, the employee may be able to defer an extra $3,000 per annum in catch-up contributions (to a lifetime maximum of $15,000).&lt;ref name="FAQ"/&gt; In the ordering of contributions, the IRS deems that the 15 year service catch-up contributions precede the age 50 catch-up contributions.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.403bwise.com/participants/getwise_faq.html#faq28 How much can be contributed to a 403(b)], 403(b)wise.com, FAQ &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt; For detailed rules regarding the Fifteen Year Rule consult [http://www.irs.gov/publications/p571/ch04.html#en_US_201212_publink1000239675 Publication 571] '' Tax Sheltered Annuity Plans (403(b)Plans)'', IRS &lt;/ref&gt;

===Distributions===
Basic rules regarding distributions from a 403(b) plan include:

* A withdrawal of assets prior to age 59-1/2, will be taxable at income tax rates and will result in the IRS imposing a 10 percent penalty tax (unless certain criteria are met.)&lt;ref group="note"&gt; Withdrawals are taxable unless you meet one of the following exclusions:
*Attain age 59-1/2
*Separate from service in or after the year in which you reach age 55
*Part of a series of substantially equal periodic payments for your life or the joint lives of you and your designated beneficiary
*Hardship
*Disability
*Death
*Made due to an IRS levy upon your participant account
*Paid to an alternative payee under a qualified domestic relations order
*Is a qualified reservist distribution as defined under the Pension Protection Act of 2006
*Is a payment of qualified medical expenses greater than 7.2% of your adjusted gross income. 
Source: [http://www.403bwise.com/participants/getwise_faq.html 403bwise FAQ] &lt;/ref&gt;

* Penalty-free withdrawals are allowed upon retirement (assumed to be in or after the year in which you reach age 55).&lt;ref name="FAQ"/&gt;
* Generally, required minimum distributions, must begin from a 403(b) no later than April 1 of the year following the year in which an individual turns age 73. If you are still working, you can delay withdrawal from your 403(b) until April 1 following the year in which you retire.&lt;ref name="FAQ"/&gt;
* 403(b) account balances that existed on December 31, 1986 are not subject to the age 70-1/2 distribution requirement. However, any earnings on that balance are. Distribution from the 12/31/86 balance needs to start at age 75. (This situation is complex, and consulting a professional tax advisor is recommended.)&lt;ref name="FAQ"/&gt;

If you own more than one 403(b), required minimum distributions are calculated in a manner similar to an IRA. You must calculate the RMD separately for each 403(b) contract that you own, but can take the total amount from one or more of the 403(b) contracts.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;This is similar to an IRA, where an IRA owner must calculate the RMD separately for each IRA that they own, but can withdraw the total amount from one or more of the IRAs. However, RMDs required from other types of retirement plans, such as 401(k) and 457(b) plans have to be taken separately from each of those plan accounts.

===Transfers===
{{401k rollover infobox}}
A number of tax-free transfers and rollovers of 403(b) plans are permissible under the tax laws.

* '''Contract exchanges'''.   If you transfer all or part of your interest from a 403(b) contract to another 403(b) contract (held in the same plan), the transfer is tax free, and is referred to as a contract exchange. This was previously known as a 90-24 transfer. A contract exchange is similar to a 90-24 transfer with one major difference. Previously, you were able to accomplish the transfer without your employer’s involvement. After September 24, 2007, all such transfers are accomplished through a contract exchange requiring your employer’s involvement. In addition, the plan must provide for the exchange and the transferred interest must be subject to the same or stricter distribution restrictions. Finally, your accumulated benefit after the exchange must be equal to what it was before the exchange.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irs.gov/publications/p571/ch08.html#en_US_201212_publink1000239748 IRS Pub 571]&lt;/ref&gt;
* If you leave your employer assets can be transferred to your new employer's defined contribution plan, if permitted by that plan.&lt;ref name="FAQ"/&gt;
* After leaving your employer, assets may be moved to a Rollover Individual Retirement Account (IRA).&lt;ref name="FAQ"/&gt;

==Advantages==
The advantages a 403(b) plan offers include the following.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.investopedia.com/articles/retirement/10/top-9-benefits-403b-plans.asp Top 9 Benefits Of A 403(b) plan], Eric Fontinelle, (April 6, 2010), investipedia &lt;/ref&gt;

* High contribution limits allow an individual to tax defer more investment dollars than can be contributed to individual retirement plans.
* Contributions to a regular 403(b) are tax deductible. Tax deductible contributions are especially advantageous if the tax rate is lower when retirement income withdrawals are made. If a Roth option is available, contributions made at low tax rates are advantageous if the tax rate is higher when retirement withdrawals are made.
* Contributions made to a 403(b) qualify for the Retirement Savings Contributions Credit ([[Saver's credit|Saver's Credit]]) if you meet the filing and income requirements.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.irs.gov/publications/p571/ch10.html Retirement Savings Contributions Credit (Saver's Credit)], Publication 571, IRS &lt;/ref&gt; 
* Employer's can make [[Employer matching contributions|matching contributions]] to employee contributions.
* Some plans may have loan provisions.&lt;ref group="note"&gt; IRS stipulations regarding 403(b)loans limits loans to the lesser of:
*$50,000
*One half of account value
The individual vendor may put additional restrictions on loan provisions. See [http://403bwise.com/participants/getwise_403b_access.html assessing 403(b)savings],  403(b)wise.com &lt;/ref&gt;
* If a 403(b) plan offers very low-cost investment options (such as those offered by [[TIAA-CREF]] in the university retirement plan market, or by a low cost mutual fund company) investors can reap most of the returns investment markets provide. Unfortunately, the 403(b) marketplace, especially in the K-12 school environment, is primarily populated by high cost, commissioned annuity products.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.403bwise.com/participants/getwise_reading.html must reads], 403(b)wise.com. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; ''[http://www.403bwise.com/pdf/who_is_watching_door_full.pdf Whose Watching The Door? How Controlling Provider Access Can Improve K-12 Teacher Retirement Outcomes]'', Research Dialogue, Issue No,. 98, TIAA-CREF Institute &lt;/ref&gt;
* 403(b) plans allow employees who have fifteen years of service to an employer to make up to $15,000 of catch up contributions to the plan.
* Participants who are eligible for both a 403(b) and a [[457(b)|457(b)]] through their employer can contribute the maximum of both plans, which at $23,000 each is a combined $46,000.&lt;ref group="note"&gt; See [http://www.457bwise.com/faqs/index.html#contributeboth 457(b)wise] FAQ for more information on 457(b) plans &lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
[[File:Fees-impact-return.gif|thumb|right|450px|Value after 35 years, assuming $250 contributed monthly with an 8 percent average annual return.]]
Since the 403(b) is heavily tied to the insurance industry,&lt;ref group="note"&gt; '''History of the 403(b) Plan'''
*403(b) programs were originally created in 1958 by Congress for employees of tax-exempt corporations. 
*In 1961, public education institutions, including public school districts, became eligible to offer 403(b) plans. 
*In 1973, Congress passed a law allowing employees to make tax-free exchanges of the full account value from one 403(b) plan to another, and partial transfers have been allowed since 1992. 
*In 1974, Congress passed the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), which included a provision allowing 403(b) plans to increase the number of their investment options and offer mutual funds in addition to annuities. 
*In 1978, a law was passed allowing employees to roll 403(b) assets into a traditional IRA. 
*Starting in 1982, with the passage of the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act, 403(b) participants were allowed to take loans from their plans. Additionally, religious organizations were permitted to set up Retirement Income Accounts, a specialized form of 403(b) plan. 
*In 1986, another tax law imposed restrictions on withdrawals before age 59½ and made them subject to a 10 percent early withdrawal penalty. Additionally, required minimum distributions (after age 70½) were established along with new limits on elective deferrals. The limit established then, $9,500 per person per year, remained in effect until 1998. 
*A 1992 IRS ruling allowed employees to make tax-free full or partial account transfers from annuities to 403(b)(7) mutual fund accounts. 
*The 2001 tax bill, which took effect in 2002, allowed 403(b) participants to roll their money into a 401(k) or governmental 457 plan when changing jobs, in addition to an IRA or other 403(b). Similarly, employees with savings in 401(k) or governmental 457 plans may roll their contributions into a 403(b) plan, if offered by their new employer. The tax bill also simplified the formula used to calculate an employee's annual contribution limit. 
* On July 23, 2007, the IRS finalized new regulations (set to go into full effect January 1, 2009) for public 403(b) retirement plans. The main highlights include:
** Requirement that a 403(b) program be maintained pursuant to a written plan which satisfies section 403(b) in both form and operation and contains all the terms and conditions for eligibility, limitations, and benefits under the plan.
** End to traditional 90-24 outside-of-plan transfers.
** Requirement to provide annual notification of eligibility
** Clarification of universal availability
** New information sharing requirements between employers and vendors.

*[http://www.403bwise.com/employers/getwise_regulations.html Overview of new rules], 403(b)wise&lt;/ref&gt; a common option of 403(b) plans is a tax-sheltered [[Fixed Annuity |fixed annuity]] or a [[Variable Annuity | variable annuity]]. These products often come with an extra layer of fees and restrictions such as surrender charges;&lt;ref group="note"&gt; According to the SEC [http://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/teacheroptions.htm Evaluating Your Retirement Options]:{{blockquote| 
For example, if you withdraw money from a variable annuity within a certain period after a purchase payment (typically within six to eight years, but sometimes as long as ten years), the insurance company usually will assess a "surrender" charge. A surrender charge is a type of sales charge that compensates the financial professional who sold the variable annuity to you. Generally, the surrender charge is a percentage of the amount you sell or exchange, and it will decline gradually over a period of several years, known as the "surrender period." For example, a 7% charge might apply in the first year after a purchase payment, 6% in the second year, 5% in the third year, and so on until the eighth year, when the surrender charge no longer applies. Some variable annuity contracts will allow you to withdraw part of your account value each year — 10% or 15% of your account value, for example — without paying a surrender charge.}}&lt;/ref&gt; furthermore, the extra tax-deferral features of the annuity are unnecessary since the 403(b) is already a tax-deferred account.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.403bwise.com/participants/getwise_investment_annuities.html Investment Basics: Why Annuities Rarely Make Sense in a 403(b)], 403(b)wise.com. &lt;/ref&gt;

Mutual funds are a possible option (known as 403(b)(7) custodial accounts) only if they are an available option within the plan. If mutual funds are not available in the 403(b) the participant should consider lobbying the employer to offer some lower fee mutual funds. If you are in this situation see [[How to campaign for a better 403(b) plan]] for information on how to proceed.

{{for|additional information|wikipedia:457 plan}}

&lt;onlyinclude&gt;Created in 1978, a '''457(b)''' plan is a non-qualified tax-deferred compensation plan similar to qualified plans such as the [[401(k)]] and [[403(b)]]. If you work for a state or local government or for a tax-exempt organization, you may be able to participate in a  section 457 deferred compensation plan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/457 26 USC § 457 - Deferred compensation plans of State and local governments and tax-exempt organizations], Legal Information Institute, Cornell Law School &lt;/ref&gt; The 457 plan may be available as an additional voluntary retirement savings vehicle for state or local government or tax-exempt organization employers also offering a public employees pension system. Or they can be offered as a supplemental retirement option for those state or local government or tax-exempt organization employers offering a 401(k) or 403(b) plan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.457bwise.com/faqs/index.html 403(b)wise. 457 FAQ] &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;&lt;!--- used for retirement plan overview --&gt;

Although 457 plans rarely provide an employer matching contribution, there is no federal 10 percent premature distribution penalty imposed on withdrawals from a 457(b) plan when separating from service.&lt;ref&gt;[https://403bwise.com/k12/content/18 403(b)wise. 457b]&lt;/ref&gt;

As always, costs matter, so before investing evaluate the fees and expenses of the investment options available in the 457 plan you are considering. Each plan chooses which investment alternatives to offer eligible employees, so fund choices and associated fees and expenses can vary.

==Types of 457 plans==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;!--- used for retirement plan overview --&gt;
There are two basic types of 457 plans:
:*''' Government Plans''': Local and state governments are eligible to establish a 457(b) plan for their employees. This type of 457(b) covers employees of a state (including the District of Columbia), a political subdivision of a state, any agency or instrumentality of a state, or political subdivision of a state. These types of employees can include: local and state government workers, fire fighters, police personnel, and public school employees. 

::Section 1448 of the Small Business Jobs Protection Act of 1996 (SBJPA) added 457(g) of the Code, which requires that 457(b) plans maintained by state or local government employers hold all plan assets and income in trust, or in custodial accounts or annuity contracts (described in 401(f) of the Code), for the exclusive benefit of their participants and beneficiaries. 

::Contributions to the 457(b) plan qualify for the [[Saver's credit|saver's credit]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irs.gov/publications/p571/ch10.html Pub 571 savers credit], IRS &lt;/ref&gt;
:* '''Non-Government Plans''': Tax-exempt organizations that are non-governmental (hospitals, charitable organizations, unions, among others) must generally limit participation to a select group of management or highly compensated employees. This is due to the rules under Title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA).

::ERISA generally requires that a private retirement plan providing benefits to employees be funded by a trust or annuity contract. The rules, however, require that private 457(b) plans be unfunded in order to obtain tax benefits. Therefore, a plan will violate ERISA unless an exception applies. This provision means that the 457 plan assets are the property of the sponsoring employer and are subject to the employer's general creditors, until paid out to plan participants.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/non-governmental-457b-deferred-compensation-plans. IRS Non_ Governmental 457b Deferred Compensation Plans]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;&lt;!--- used for retirement plan overview --&gt;

Each 457 plan is required to have a written plan document. It is essential to refer to this document for the details on how your 457 plan operates, including the investment options offered by the plan, fees and expenses, and specific withdrawal options.&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

===Roth 457(b)===
If an employer offers a Roth 457(b) provision, an employee can designate all or a portion of their 457(b) as an after-tax Roth contribution. These contributions are made with after tax earnings. Unlike the advantage a pre-tax 457(b) has over pre-tax 401(k) and 403(b) plans, withdrawals from a Roth 457(b) are subject to the same age 59.5 restrictions as other Roth plans.  Worse yet for those taking pre-59.5 withdrawals, Roth 457(b) distributions are taken on a pro-rata basis between contributions and gains, unlike the "contributions first" treatment given to Roth IRA distributions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=222789 Roth 457 vs. Roth IRA - Bogleheads.org]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Employees have the option of making pre-tax 457(b) contributions, Roth 457(b) contributions, or a combination of the two. Total contributions cannot exceed the year's contribution limit.&lt;ref&gt;[https://403bwise.com/k12/content/18 457(b)], 403(b)wise.com. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Contributions==
The contribution limits are the same as for other employer plans.  However, participants may invest the maximum allowable contribution in both a 457 plan and a [[401(k)]] or [[403(b) | 403(b)]] plan of both are available.  The combined maximum contribution for 2026 is thus $49,000. The [[#Catch up provision |"final three year"]] and Age 50+
catch-up cannot be used in the same tax year.&lt;ref&gt;[https://dcprovider.com/PDF/tn/Tenn_Plan_Comparison_FINAL_03182013.pdf Comparison of the Governmental 457(b) and 401(k) Plans]&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the age 50+  and 60-63 higher limits are only applicable to governmental 457 plans, not to non-governmental plans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Non-governmental 457(b) deferred compensation plans|url=https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/non-governmental-457b-deferred-compensation-plans|access-date=June 25, 2025|website=Internal Revenue Service}}&lt;/ref&gt; The table below reflects 457 plan contribution limits, again noting that 50+ and 60-63 catchup contributions aren’t applicable to non-governmental 457 plans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=What is a 457(b) plan and how does it work?|url=https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/smart-money/what-is-a-457b|access-date=June 25, 2025|website=Fidelity Investments}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Catch-up contributions for 2026 must be made to a Roth account if the employee's 2025 salary was over $150,000.

{{Retirement Plan Contribution Limits}}
===Catch up provision===
The 457(b) plan often contains a special "catch-up" provision called the "final three year" provision for those approaching retirement (assuming they haven't contributed the maximum amount in prior years). Employers are not required to offer this provision. For those that do, the "catch-up" provision kicks in during the three years prior to "normal" retirement age (as defined in the plan). This provision, now permits up to 200% of the elective deferral limit, or $47,000 in 2025, $49,000 in 2026.

{{Notice|''Example'': Victor will reach "normal" retirement age in 2021; under his plan he can take advantage of the "final three year" provision in years 2018, 2019, and 2020. If Victor takes advantage of this provision he cannot also take advantage of the "Age 50 catch-up" provision. Note: to determine the underutilized amounts in prior years all of the prior coordination rules apply.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.457bwise.com/faqs/index.html 457bwise. 457 FAQ]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Investment options==
457(b) plans can be funded with:
:*Group [[Fixed annuity|fixed]] and [[Variable annuity|variable annuities]]
:*Retail [[Mutual fund|mutual funds]]
:*Bank instruments
:*A combination of all three

==Withdrawals==
Government 457(b) plans are subject to income tax upon withdrawal but are not subject to the 10% early withdrawal penalty. Funds can be withdrawn at retirement, upon severance from the employer, upon death, upon disability, and under stringent hardship withdrawal rules. Funds must be withdrawn at age 73 (unless you are still working) and are subject to the [[IRA distribution tables|required minimum distributions]] rules.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irs.gov/Retirement-Plans/Retirement-Plans-FAQs-regarding-Required-Minimum-Distributions Retirement Plans FAQs regarding Required Minimum Distributions], IRS &lt;/ref&gt; Different rules apply if you work for a tax-exempt organization (you must see the employer plan document for the details.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.457bwise.com/faqs/index.html 403(b)wise. 457 FAQ]&lt;/ref&gt;
  
===Hardship withdrawals===
The IRS has strict guidelines for allowable hardship withdrawals:

Under a 457(b) plan, a hardship distribution can only occur when the participant is faced with an unforeseeable emergency. (Code § 457(d)(1)(iii))

An unforeseeable emergency is a severe financial hardship resulting from an illness or accident, loss of property due to casualty, or other similar extraordinary and unforeseeable circumstances arising as a result of events beyond the control of the participant or beneficiary. Examples of events that may be considered unforeseeable emergencies include imminent foreclosure on, or eviction from, the employee's home, medical expenses, and funeral expenses. Generally, the purchase of a home and the payment of college tuition are not unforeseeable emergencies.
(Reg. § 1.457-6(c)(2)(i))

Whether a participant or beneficiary is faced with an unforeseeable emergency depends on the facts and circumstances. However, a distribution is not on account of an unforeseeable emergency to the extent that the emergency can be relieved through reimbursement or compensation from insurance, liquidation of the participant's assets, or cessation of deferrals under the plan. (Reg. § 1.457-6(c)(2)(ii))

A distribution on account of an unforeseeable emergency must not exceed the amount reasonably necessary to satisfy the emergency need. (Reg. § 1.457-6(c)(2)(iii))&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irs.gov/retirement/article/0,,id=162416,00.html IRS Retirement Plans FAQs regarding Hardship Distributions]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rollovers==
{{401k rollover infobox}}
An employer is not required to accept rollover contributions, so it is necessary to check a 457(b) plan's written document for its rules on plan rollovers.
 
Rollover provisions are more liberal for a government 457(b) plan than for non-government 457 plans. A government 457(b) plan can be rolled over to another employer's 457 plan, a 401(k) plan, a 403(b) plan or a rollover [[Traditional IRA|traditional IRA.]] However, assets transferred out of the 457 into a non 457 plan will lose the exemption to the early withdrawal penalty that 457 plans enjoy. Likewise, if you roll non 457 plan assets into an employer provided 457 plan, these assets do not gain exemption from the early withdrawal penalty.

Non-government 457 plans can only be rolled over to another non government 457 plan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p4484.pdf  IRS:Choose a Retirement Plan]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{for|additional information|wikipedia:Health savings account}}

A '''{{PAGENAME}} (HSA)''' is a special account which is used in conjunction with a [[High deductible health plan | high deductible health plan]]. Unlike a [[Flexible spending arrangement  | flexible spending account]], unused money remains in the account and can be invested; most accounts offer either [[mutual fund]]s or brokerage accounts for investing. 

HSAs are often referred to as "triple-tax advantaged", a feature that makes them unique among all investment accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/19/business/health-savings-accounts-tax-break.html|title=The Triple Tax Break You May Be Missing: A Health Savings Account|publisher=The New York Times|date=March 19, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contributions are tax-deductible on federal and most state tax returns; earnings and withdrawals are also tax-free if used for medical expenses. After age 65, you can use HSAs for non-medical purposes, with these withdrawals taxed like a traditional IRA. For this reason, investors should usually contribute to an HSA [[#Contribution_priority_compared_to_other_accounts|before]] making [[Employer matching contributions|unmatched]] retirement account contributions.

You must be covered by a [[high deductible health plan]] to make HSA contributions. Unlike most health insurance, the high deductible plan pays nothing except for preventive care until you meet a fairly high deductible. Determine if this type of plan is appropriate for your personal circumstances and health care needs. If it is, then using the HSA as an investment account can be advantageous.

==How an HSA works==

[https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p969.pdf IRS Publication 969] contains the details of how HSAs work.

===Basics===

You are eligible to contribute to an HSA if you meet the following requirements:
*You are covered under a [[high deductible health plan]], or (starting in 2026) any Catastrophic or Bronze plan from the Affordable Care Act marketplace.
*You have no other health coverage, except for dental, vision, and other specific exceptions
*Neither you '''nor your spouse''' participates in a general purpose [[Flexible spending arrangement|Flexible Spending Account (FSA)]] (because an FSA can be used to reimburse a spouse's medical expenses)
*You are not enrolled in [[Medicare]]
*You are not eligible to be claimed as a dependent on someone else’s tax return

You may withdraw from the HSA tax-free to reimburse qualified medical expenses, even if you are no longer eligible to contribute. Notably, there is no time limit for how long you can wait to withdraw money to reimburse yourself for the expense. This feature allows a [[#Maxing_out_retirement_accounts|strategy]] where you can save receipts for eligible expenses for years or decades, while letting the HSA grow tax-deferred. You can then withdraw from the HSA tax-free later in life for past medical expenses and retirement medical expenses.

You pay tax on withdrawals for other purposes as ordinary income, with an extra 20% penalty. The penalty is waived if you are at least 65 or disabled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p969.pdf|title=Publication 969, Health Savings Accounts and Other Tax-Favored Health Plans|publisher=IRS|accessdate=June 25, 2024|page=10|quote=Additional Tax ... Exceptions. There is no additional tax on distributions made after the date you are disabled, reach age 65, or die.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because withdrawals after age 65 are taxable but penalty-free, the account can also behave like a [[traditional IRA]] when used this way. Because these features allow additional tax-advantaged retirement savings, HSAs are sometimes referred to as "Stealth IRAs".

===Contribution limits===

The 2025 annual limit is $4,400 for an individual plan, or $8,750 for a family plan&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/rp-25-19.pdf|title=IRS Revenue Procedure 2025-19|publisher=IRS|accessdate=27 November 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt; (defined as covering an eligible individual plus at least one other individual), plus $1,000 catch-up contributions if you are at least 55. Contribution limits include both contributions from the HSA participant as well as employer contributions, which are not included in your taxable income.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|format=pdf|url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p969.pdf|title=Publication 969, Health Savings Accounts and Other Tax-Favored Health Plans|publisher=IRS|accessdate=June 25, 2024|page=7|quote=Reporting Contributions on Your Return. Contributions made by your employer aren't included in your income. Contributions to an employee's account by an employer using the amount of an employee's salary reduction through a cafeteria plan are treated as employer contributions. Generally, you can claim contributions you made and contributions made by any other person, other than your employer, on your behalf, as an adjustment to income.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning with the first month you are enrolled in Medicare, your contribution limit is zero.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|format=pdf|url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p969.pdf|title=Publication 969, Health Savings Accounts and Other Tax-Favored Health Plans|publisher=IRS|accessdate=June 25, 2024|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contributions for a family plan only get one $1,000 catch-up even if both spouses are age 55+. This limitation can be circumvented by the other spouse opening up an HSA in their name and contributing $1,000 (or more, as long as the total contributions for both spouses do not exceed the family plan limit plus two catch-ups). HSA contributions have no minimum or maximum income, and these contributions will reduce taxable income on a Married Filing Jointly tax return even if the other spouse has no income. HSAs are always individually-titled accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Forum post|t=411068|title=HSA catch-up contributions for couple (both 55+)|date=August 19, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If you are enrolled in an HDHP for only part of the year, the maximum contribution amount varies based on several factors. The '''last-month rule''' lets you contribute the full annual contribution for a tax year if you are eligible to contribute on December 1st of that year, as long as you remain eligible to contribute through December 31st of the ''following'' year. The last-month rule also lets you contribute the family limit for the year if you have family HDHP coverage on December 1st, even if you only had individual coverage earlier in the year. For more complicated situations involving part-year coverage and/or changing between individual and family coverage, the annual limit is prorated by month;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://livelyme.com/blog/hsa-contribution-limits-mid-year-changes|title=Mid-year HSA Changes: How Status Affects Annual Contribution Limits|format=|page=|publisher=Lively Inc.|accessdate=June 26, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt; see [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p969.pdf IRS Publication 969] for specifics.

If you or your spouse have a general-purpose healthcare FSA, you are both ineligible to contribute to an HSA. However, a [[Flexible_spending_arrangement#Limited-purpose_FSA|limited-purpose FSA]], such as a Dependent Care FSA, does not disqualify anyone from contributing to an HSA.

A non-dependent child who is still covered only by a parent's HDHP (in other words, meets the requirements listed under [[#Basics|basic HSA rules]]) may contribute the ''family'' maximum to their own HSA. The child's HSA is completely separate from the parent's HSA.

You have until April 15th of the following year to contribute to your HSA for a given tax year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p969.pdf|title=Publication 969, Health Savings Accounts and Other Tax-Favored Health Plans|publisher=IRS|accessdate=June 25, 2024|page=8|quote=When To Contribute: You can make contributions to your HSA for 2023 through April 15, 2024. If you fail to be an eligible individual during 2023, you can still make contributions through April 15, 2024, for the months you were an eligible individual.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tax considerations===

Unlike many other tax deductions, there are no income restrictions to contribute to an HSA. Contributions to an HSA reduce your federal adjusted gross income (AGI) dollar for dollar, possibly making you eligible for income-based credits or [[Roth IRA]] contributions you would not otherwise be eligible for without the HSA deduction.

If your employer allows it, you can make your own contributions through pre-tax [[payroll deduction]]; this has the potential advantage that these contributions, like pre-tax insurance premiums, are not subject to [[Social Security]] and Medicare taxes (collectively known as [[Payroll - FICA tax deductions|payroll or FICA taxes]]), so long as the plan is classified as a Section 125 or "cafeteria" plan. If you are below the Social Security Wage Base, the reduction in Social Security taxes may reduce your future Social Security benefits. The [[Social Security as an investment|benefit or drawback of saving Social Security tax]] depends on your lifetime earning record. Generally, high earners come out ahead by avoiding FICA taxes, low earners come out behind, and middle earners come close to breaking even. See: [[Social Security as an investment]] and [[#Contribution_priority_compared_to_other_accounts|below]]. 

===State taxation of HSAs===

While contributions are deductible on your federal income tax, this is not always true for [[State income taxes|state income tax]]. The following states do not conform to federal legislation and do not recognize HSAs, so contributions are not deductible and earnings are taxable:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hsaforamerica.com/state-income-tax.htm|title=HSA State Income Tax|publisher=HSA For America}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*California
*New Jersey 

If you live in one of these states you must treat the HSA as a [[taxable account]] for state tax purposes, and keep track of [[Specific identification of shares|tax lots]], dividends, capital gains, distributions, and so on within the account. The IRS does not require HSA administrators to send you tax forms (such as 1099-INT or 1099-B), so you have to keep good records, track the state cost basis manually, and report any HSA investment income on your state tax return. If you live in one of these states, consider keeping your HSA investments especially simple to limit the work involved in this non-trivial task. 

You may be able to include amounts paid for medical expenses as an itemized deduction on the state tax return, subject to AGI floors, but only in the year you incurred the expense.

If you live in one of these states, consider investing the HSA in [[Treasury bonds]] or [[TIPS]], which are exempt from state taxes. (In California, you would pay state tax on capital gains issued by a TIPS/Treasury mutual fund or capital gain/loss on the sale of Treasury mutual fund shares, but even if you do, most of the returns from Treasury bonds and TIPS would be income which is not subject to state tax. New Jersey exempts capital gains on Treasuries from state tax.) [[Tax loss harvesting]] may be possible on the state tax return if you have capital gains or the state allows carryovers of capital losses. 

If you move from a state which does not tax HSAs to a state which taxes HSAs, sell any holdings with capital gains before you move, so that you will not pay taxes on the same capital gains when you sell the same holdings later as a resident of the state. You can buy back the same or similar holdings immediately after selling.

In states that tax contributions, be aware that Federal tax-free rollovers into an HSA, such as the once in a lifetime IRA to HSA rollover, and an Archer MSA to HSA rollover, are treated as a non-qualified withdrawal from the IRA/MSA at the state level and subject to income taxes and penalties on the state return. Also in states that tax contributions, the state treats the HSA as a taxable account, so that taxable investing rules apply.

===Withdrawals===

Withdrawals for qualified medical expenses (as outlined in [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p502.pdf IRS Publication 502, Medical and Dental Expenses]) that you, your spouse, and any dependents incur after you establish the HSA are tax-free. These include medical expenses you incur after you are no longer eligible to contribute to the HSA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/irb/2004-33_IRB/ar08.html|title=IRS Notice 2004-33|publisher=IRS|accessdate=June 25, 2024|quote=Question 39: ...}}&lt;/ref&gt; As long as you keep proper records, there is no limit for how long you can wait to reimburse yourself for qualified expenses. Medical expenses from before you established the HSA are ''not'' eligible for tax-free withdrawals, even if you had HDHP coverage and would have been eligible to contribute to an HSA. 

State law determines when an HSA is established. Most state laws require that a trust be funded to be established. This means that in most cases an HSA is not established until your first contribution goes into the HSA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.newfront.com/blog/hsa-establishment-date|title=HSA Establishment Date|publisher=Newfront|accessdate=August 5, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Withdrawals to pay for some types of medical insurance premiums are also tax-free. As detailed in [https://www.irs.gov/irb/2004-02_IRB#NOT-2004-2 Internal Revenue Bulletin 2004-2 (January 12, 2004) - Health Savings Accounts - Q&amp;A 27], you can use HSA funds to pay for qualified long-term care insurance (but only up to IRS specified dollar amounts), COBRA health care continuation coverage, and health care coverage while receiving unemployment compensation.  Furthermore, once reaching age 65, you can pay premiums for Medicare Part A or B, Medicare HMO, and the employee share of premiums for employer-sponsored health insurance (including premiums for employer-sponsored retiree health insurance) from an HSA. Premiums for Medigap policies are '''not''' qualified medical expenses and therefore cannot be paid tax-free from an HSA. 

There was further clarification in [https://www.irs.gov/irb/2008-29_IRB Internal Revenue Bulletin: 2008-29 (July 21, 2008) - Notice 2008-59 - Health Savings Accounts - Q&amp;A-29. Payment of Medicare Part D premiums]. This Q&amp;A clarified that Medicare Part D premiums are eligible expenses. The previous 2004 guidance had came out before Medicare Part D was established in 2006, therefore this guidance provided clarity for Medicare Part D premiums.

===Rollovers/Transfers===

You can move money between HSA custodians through direct rollovers and trustee-to-trustee transfers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p969.pdf|title=Publication 969, Health Savings Accounts and Other Tax-Favored Health Plans|publisher=IRS|accessdate=June 25, 2024|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rules are exactly the same as [[IRA Rollovers and Transfers]]. You may want to do this annually if you contribute to a plan through your employer's payroll deduction to gain the social security and medicare payroll tax exemption, but you do not want to leave the funds there long-term if the investment options are not good. The HSA custodian(s) may charge a fee for a trustee-to-trustee transfer; you can usually rollover directly without a fee.

You can make a once-in-a-lifetime rollover or transfer from an [[IRA]] to an HSA up to the annual HSA contribution limit. This is usually not a good idea, because you then lose the ability to contribute and take an HSA tax deduction for the amount you transfer, but it can be an emergency source of funds without paying taxes or penalties.&lt;ref name="thef_One-"&gt;{{Cite web | title = One-Time Transfer From IRA To HSA: Forget About It | author-link =The Finance Buff| first=Harry | last=Sit  | work = The Finance Buff | date = March 14, 2017 | accessdate = 2017-11-04 | url = https://thefinancebuff.com/one-time-transfer-from-ira-to-hsa-forget-about-it.html | quote =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; See [https://www.irs.gov/irb/2008-25_IRB/ar09.html IRS Notice 2008-51]. You can also roll over an Archer MSA to an HSA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p969.pdf|title=Publication 969, Health Savings Accounts and Other Tax-Favored Health Plans|publisher=IRS|accessdate=June 25, 2024|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; If you live in a [[#State_taxation_of_HSAs|state that taxes HSA contributions]], these rollovers have the additional drawback of incurring state taxes and penalties. 

===Medicare===
{{See also|Medicare#Health savings account|label 1=Medicare}}

Social Security recipients 65 years of age or older are automatically enrolled in [[Medicare]] Part A and therefore ineligible to contribute to a Health Savings Account.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cms.gov/medicare/eligibility-and-enrollment/origmedicarepartabeligenrol/index.html|title=Original Medicare (Part A and B) Eligibility and Enrollment|publisher=Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services|accessdate=28 Aug 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aarp.org/health/medicare-insurance/info-04-2009/ask_ms_medicare_question_53.html|title=Can I Have a Health Savings Account as Well as Medicare?|publisher=AARP|accessdate=28 Aug 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

You must stop contributing to your HSA when you enroll in Medicare. However, you may use money that is already in your HSA after you enroll in Medicare to help pay for deductibles, premiums, copayments, or coinsurance.&lt;ref name="MedicareAndU"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.medicare.gov/pubs/pdf/10050-Medicare-and-You.pdf|title=Medicare and You|publisher=Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Service|accessdate=Nov 13, 2017}}, page 23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IRScontrib"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p969.pdf|title=Publication 969, Health Savings Accounts and Other Tax-Favored Health Plans|publisher=IRS|accessdate=June 25, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Premium-free Part A coverage begins six months back ''from the date you apply for Medicare'' (or Social Security/RRB benefits), but ''no earlier than the first month you were eligible for Medicare''. To avoid a tax penalty, make your last HSA contribution the month before your Part A coverage begins.&lt;ref name="MedicareAndU" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Forum post|p=3616132|title=Re: Medicare &lt;nowiki&gt;[Can I contribute to Health Savings Account?]&lt;/nowiki&gt;|author=Spirit Rider}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If you contribute to your HSA after your Medicare coverage starts, you may have to pay a tax penalty. Generally, you must pay a 6% excise tax on excess contributions. The excise tax applies to ''each tax year'' the excess contribution remains in the account.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p969.pdf|title=Publication 969, Health Savings Accounts and Other Tax-Favored Health Plans|publisher=IRS|accessdate=June 25, 2024|quote=Excess contributions ...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If you expect to have a [[#Overfunded_HSA|much larger HSA balance]] than your medical expenses, give consideration to using Medicare supplement plan G - high deductible. You would save on supplement premiums relative to the regular plan G and could use the HSA to pay deductibles. This would convert an expense that is not HSA-eligible (supplement premium) to an expense that is eligible (meeting deductible for part B services). Other, less generous and cheaper supplement plans might also be worth considering.

===Death of HSA holder===

A spouse beneficiary can inherit an HSA. Any other beneficiary will receive the HSA as a taxable distribution. See the Inherited HSA section [[#Inherited HSA|below]] for more details.

==How the account operates==

Details vary among HSA custodians, but in general you can withdraw no more than your current HSA balance.  This differs from [[Flexible spending arrangement#Distributions from an FSA|FSA distributions]] that allow withdrawals up to your planned contribution amount, even if you have not yet made all those contributions. The custodian may provide you with checks or a debit card to pay medical providers, and you can make online withdrawals from the HSA.

When you file taxes, [https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-8889 Form 8889] is how you tell the IRS how much of those withdrawals were for qualified medical expenses.

Some HSA custodians require you to keep a certain amount of your HSA as cash, while others allow you to invest using the same choices you would have with an IRA at that custodian.

You can choose your custodian, and transfer accounts between different custodians. However, if your health plan or employer makes a contribution, it may select the custodian to which it makes contributions, and may offer other incentives such as waiving service fees.

==How to use the plan==
{{See also|Emergency fund#Health savings account as an emergency fund | label 1=Health savings account as an emergency fund}}

There are two ways to use the HSA. You can either pay all your medical expenses from it, or pay out of pocket and save the plan money for medical expenses in retirement. Even if you use the HSA to pay current expenses, you will likely accumulate more than you spend, and can invest the remainder for medical expenses in retirement.

===Contribution priority compared to other accounts===
{{Main|Prioritizing investments}}

Usually, you should contribute to an [[Employer_retirement_plans_overview|employer retirement plan]] when you get a [[Employer_matching_contributions|match]], and pay off high-interest debts, before contributing to an HSA. But, you should contribute to an HSA before an employer plan when you do not get a match, or an [[IRA]]. The reason is that HSA contributions are tax-deductible, and if your medical expenses are high enough, the withdrawals can be tax-free too. With retirement accounts, either the contributions (pre-tax accounts) or withdrawals (Roth accounts) are tax-free, but not both. In the worst case where you do not have sufficient medical expenses to later withdraw tax-free, withdrawals after age 65 are taxable but penalty-free, so the account behaves similarly to a pre-tax retirement account ([[traditional IRA]], [[401(k)]], and others). 

In addition, HSA contributions via employer [[Payroll_-_cafeteria_plan_deductions#Health_Savings_Account|payroll deduction]] are exempt from [[Payroll_-_FICA_tax_deductions|FICA taxes]], where 401(k) and IRA contributions are not,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.voya.com/voya-insights/undervalued-benefit-hsa-programs-employers-and-employees-may-be-missing-fica-savings|title=The undervalued benefit of HSA programs employers and employees may be missing: FICA savings|publisher=Voya Financial|accessdate=June 26, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc424.html|title=Topic 424 - 401(k) Plans|publisher=IRS|accessdate=June 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this is usually a benefit. Higher-income investors above the second Social Security bend point should expect a [[Social_Security_as_an_investment#Rate_of_return|low or negative rate of return]] on Social Security taxes, so avoiding these taxes is a big benefit. Investors between the first and second bend-points can expect a modest return, and the benefit of avoiding Social Security taxes is not clear. Those below the first bend-point can expect an excellent return on Social Security taxes and should not avoid them. But, you can choose to pay FICA taxes on HSA contributions by contributing directly to the custodian, rather than via employer payroll deduction. 

You will also see a benefit in avoiding payroll tax if it will not affect your future Social Security benefits, such as when:

*You will not accrue 40 work credits (equivalent to ten years) necessary to qualify for Social Security benefits
*The current year will not be one of your top 35 earning years (adjusted for inflation)
*You expect to collect Social Security benefits based on someone else's earnings record
*Your earned income this year will be higher than the Social Security Wage Base ($168,600 as of 2024), which saves Medicare taxes only

See [[Social Security as an investment]] for more details.

===During working years===

During your working years, the choice of withdrawing from an HSA to pay for medical expenses, or paying them out-of-pocket, comes down to what you would otherwise do with the money. If withdrawing from the HSA means you can contribute more money into retirement accounts, that is the better choice. If you can afford to pay out-of-pocket for the medical expenses and would otherwise invest the money in a [[taxable account]], it is probably better to pay out-of-pocket, although there are exceptions.

====Maxing out retirement accounts====

If you are maxing out your retirement accounts, you should probably pay for current medical expenses out-of-pocket and leave the money in the HSA. This strategy treats the HSA as an opportunity for further retirement savings, like an IRA, with the plan to not withdraw from it until you retire. If you have $1,000 in medical bills, paying them out-of-pocket leaves the $1,000 in the HSA to grow tax-deferred or tax-free, and keeps the right to withdraw $1,000 tax-free in a future year (if you save records appropriately). If you pay the expense from the HSA, you will have an extra $1,000 to invest in your [[taxable account]], which will grow more slowly due to [[Taxable_account#Taxable_account_investing_strategy|tax drag]].

The biggest advantage of leaving the money in the HSA comes from the possibility that medical expenses will allow the ''growth'' on the money to also be tax-free. This can happen due to future medical expenses (including [[Medicare]] premiums), or if you have so many other past medical expenses that the HSA balance is unlikely to ever exceed them. In this case, future growth and withdrawals will be tax-free, similar to a Roth account. 

However, if you expect your HSA balance to be so large (and/or your medical expenses to be so small) that you will have to take taxable withdrawals, there may be better strategies. See: [[#Overfunded_HSA|Overfunded HSA]] below.

====Not maxing retirement accounts====

If you are not maxing out your retirement accounts, you should pay current expenses from the HSA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Forum post|t=150572|title=Confused by Wiki Advice on HSA Spending|date=10 Nov 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; If you are in a 24% tax bracket and have $1,000 in medical bills, taking $1,000 from the HSA to pay the bill means you can invest an extra $1,000 in your [[Roth IRA]] or $1,316 in your [[401(k)]], either of which will be as good or better than leaving it in the HSA.

If you keep the $1,000 in the HSA and pay the expense out-of-pocket, you will have the right to withdraw $1,000 tax-free from the HSA later, but the growth on the $1,000 might be tax-free or taxable depending on your medical expenses. The right to withdraw the $1,000 tax-free could even be lost if you leave the HSA to a non-spouse, or if you lose the receipts. But if you pay the expense out of the HSA and invest the $1,000 in a Roth IRA, your future gains will always be tax-free to you and your heirs, and your heirs get an additional [[Stretch IRA|ten-year stretch]]. If you invested $1,316 in a 401(k), that is just as good after adjusting for the presumed 24% tax you will pay in retirement.

===Withdrawing in retirement===
{{Main|Retirement draw-down priority}}

After you retire, you can withdraw from the HSA an amount equal to your past medical expenses plus any current expenses tax-free, and withdraw from your other accounts for non-medical expenses. HSAs can be used to pay medicare premiums and other medical expenses in retirement. If you are too healthy in retirement and cannot use the HSA for medical expenses (even past ones), the non-medical portion is still as good as a [[traditional IRA]] once you are age 65.

====Tax-free withdrawals====

If you need cash for spending and are choosing between withdrawals from an HSA and a Roth account, withdraw from the HSA tax-free (based on past and current medical expenses) before withdrawing from Roth accounts. Withdrawing tax-free from an HSA will almost always be better, and never worse, than withdrawing from a Roth account,&lt;ref&gt;{{Forum post|p=1973176|title=HSA as stealth IRA - Inheritance issue|date=25 Feb 2014|quote=Those with both Roth IRA accounts and HSA accounts with unreimbursed qualified medical expenses, should distribute those tax-free HSA dollars before touching the Roth accounts. Also, upon turning 65 they should make distributions for Medicare Part B premiums, and other qualified medical expenses (co-pay, co-insurance, dental, vision. etc...). Tax-free HSA dollars should always be spent before Roth dollars.}}&lt;/ref&gt; because: 

#Foregone future growth on the HSA money may or may not be tax-free, whereas growth on the Roth money will always be tax-free (as long as you meet the basic [[Roth_IRA#Treatment_of_distributions|distribution requirements]]) with the additional benefit of a [[Stretch_IRA|ten-year stretch]].
#It is possible that the HSA money might later become taxable if you wait to withdraw (if receipts get lost, someone forgets to make a qualified withdrawal, or the account is [[Health_savings_account#Non-spouse_beneficiary|left to a non-spouse]]).
#It eliminates the need to keep receipts for those expenses going forward (once the normal [[Record_retention#How_long_to_keep_records|retention period]] for tax records has passed), along with the risk they could get lost, destroyed, have ink fade, and so on.  

If you need cash for spending and are choosing between withdrawals from an HSA and a pre-tax traditional account, consider instead the combination of tax-free HSA withdrawal and a [[Roth conversion]]. This has the same tax impact as a pre-tax withdrawal, but shifts money from an HSA to a Roth account, which is desirable for the above reasons. Therefore, you should always withdraw tax-free from an HSA before retirement accounts.

In some cases, it can make sense to withdraw tax-free from an HSA as a tax-planning maneuver even if you do not need the money for spending, and reinvest it in a [[taxable account]]. Examples include when:

*You think there is a chance the money will not be later withdrawn tax-free, because the receipts might get lost, you or your surviving spouse might forget, or you plan to leave the money to a non-spouse and could die suddenly.
*You might have an [[#Overfunded_HSA|overfunded HSA]]. Although the dollars in the taxable account will grow more slowly, the lower tax rates on long-term capital gains and the [[step-up in basis]] should more than compensate for [[stock]]-like investments. See [[#Overfunded_HSA|below]] for more details.

As you reach later retirement, the benefit of continuing to leave money in the HSA decreases (there are fewer years of potential tax-advantaged growth) and the risk of losing the right to withdraw tax-free increases. How long you want to push it is a personal decision, but there will be a point when the benefits no longer outweigh the risks, unless you have named a charitable organization to inherit your HSA.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Handling HSAs After Death or Divorce | author1 = Helen Modly|author2 = Tommie Monez| work = Morningstar| date = October 22, 2016 | accessdate = Jan 22, 2019| url = https://www.morningstar.com/articles/774640/handling-hsas-after-death-or-divorce.html| url-access=subscription | language = en-us | quote=There is a good case for allowing the HSA balances to grow as a cushion for high medical expenses later in life, but consideration should also be given to the inheritance tax disadvantage. Eventually using up the tax-free dollars for medical expenses or naming a charity as beneficiary can mitigate or eliminate the tax consequences.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In mid- to late-retirement, withdrawing the HSA roughly evenly over your life expectancy could be a reasonable compromise.

====Taxable withdrawals====

Taxable withdrawals from an HSA usually do not make sense when other sources of funding are available, because possible future medical expenses would allow future tax-free withdrawals. If you have current or past medical expenses for which you have saved receipts, and can therefore take a tax-free withdrawal, it is almost always better to do so rather than take a taxable withdrawal. Taxable HSA withdrawals can provide a source of funding when other assets have been exhausted. Taxable withdrawals can also be beneficial for tax-planning when you have an overfunded HSA; see [[#Overfunded_HSA|below]].

===How to invest the HSA===

If you are paying current expenses out of pocket, the HSA is intended for medical expenses in retirement. You should therefore invest it as if part of your IRA or 401(k), as those accounts are also invested for retirement expenses. If you are using the HSA for current expenses, consider at least one year's deductible as part of your [[emergency fund]], because it is likely you will need this amount for medical bills; you can invest the remainder as if part of an IRA or 401(k).

If you view the HSA as part of your overall retirement portfolio, you can then choose which assets from your [[asset allocation]] to hold in your HSA, and which to hold elsewhere. If you live in a state that does not recognize HSAs, state taxes give a strong incentive to hold Treasury bonds or TIPS there. In the other states, HSAs are similar to Roth accounts in terms of the principles of [[Tax-efficient_fund_placement#Step_4:_Place_high_growth_stock_funds|tax-efficient fund placement for tax free accounts]]. If you have an [[#Overfunded_HSA|overfunded HSA]], it will behave less like a Roth account and more like a traditional IRA (or even a [[Non-deductible traditional IRA|non-deductible IRA]]) for asset location purposes, and it could make sense to shift your HSA to contain bonds rather than stocks. 

==Overfunded HSA==

An ''overfunded HSA'' is one where the balance exceeds, or is likely to exceed, available qualified medical expenses over your and your spouse's lifetime.

While this can happen, many retirees underestimate their healthcare expenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://moneywise.com/retirement/retirement/nearly-50-of-american-retirees-underestimated-their-healthcare-costs-and-how-far-medicare-would-stretch|title=Nearly 50% of American retirees underestimated their healthcare costs — and how far Medicare would stretch. 3 simple ways to protect yourself|publisher=MoneyWise|accessdate=July 18, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt; High savers may find themselves in higher [[Income-Related Monthly Adjustment Amount (IRMAA)|IRMAA]] tiers, leading to additional qualified medical expenses because Medicare premiums (including IRMAA) are qualified medical expenses for an HSA.

An overfunded HSA may also be intentional, because a high earner planning a lower cost retirement may enjoy the similarity to a traditional deductible IRA and be happy to save a high marginal rate and then pay a lower marginal rate when withdrawing after age 65.

Overfunded HSAs usually result from leaving money invested inside the HSA over long periods of time, where the balance can compound fully tax-deferred; medical expenses do not compound even if they accrue annually. 

===Cautions===

If you are younger and your future medical expenses are very uncertain, it is probably best to leave money in the HSA as long as possible, to prepare for the more likely case that your future medical expenses will let you eventually withdraw the entire HSA balance tax-free.  

Withdrawals for non-medical expenses are taxable, and also have a 20% penalty if you are under age 65. Large HSA balances also increase the risk of leaving your heirs with a large spike of taxable income in a single year. The tax advantages of an HSA are much better when you are able to use it for qualified medical expenses and withdraw tax-free. 

Leaving money in the HSA also has the benefit of many decades of tax-deferred growth, which can [[Non-deductible_traditional_IRA#Performance|overcome]] higher tax rates that might come later on. Actions to mitigate an overfunded HSA are best taken once you are closer to retirement or already in retirement, when you have much less uncertainty about the relative sizes of your HSA and medical expenses.

===Mitigations===

If you might unintentionally have an overfunded HSA, consider one or more of the following strategies to mitigate the tax impact:

*Pay for medical expenses out of the HSA even when you are [[#Maxing_out_retirement_accounts|maxing out your retirement accounts]].
*Withdraw tax-free from your HSA even if you do not need the money for spending, and reinvest the money in a [[taxable account]].
*Shift your [[Bond basics|bond]] allocation into the HSA and [[stock]] allocation into retirement accounts.
*During the accumulation phase, switch to a non-HSA-eligible medical plan (that is, a low-deductible plan) if those premiums are competitive.
*Choose Medicare supplement plans with smaller premiums but higher deductibles, which shifts non-HSA-eligible expenses to HSA-eligible expenses.
*Spread the HSA out over multiple [[Asset_titling_in_the_United_States#Beneficiary_designation|beneficiaries]].
*Name a charity or [[Donor advised fund|Donor Advised Fund (DAF)]] as the beneficiary of the HSA, if you were planning to leave some of your estate to charity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Forum post|t=256861|title=The problem with 'saving receipts' for future qualified HSA withdrawals|date=19 Aug 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If you expect to not live much longer and plan to leave an overfunded HSA to non-spouse heirs, taxable HSA withdrawals should be a higher priority than pre-tax retirement accounts. Unlike pre-tax accounts, HSAs do not get a [[Stretch IRA|ten-year stretch]], which means heirs do not get up to ten years of tax-protected growth, and if the balance is large on a per-heir basis, the large income in a single year can spike their tax rates more than if it were spread across ten years.

===Similarity to a non-deductible IRA===

The up-front tax deduction and potential for tax-free growth is what makes HSA ''contributions'' better than most other retirement account contributions when [[Prioritizing investments]], as noted [[#Contribution_priority_compared_to_other_accounts|above]]. Treating the HSA balance above qualified medical expenses as a [[traditional IRA]] (except without the ability to [[Roth_conversion|convert to Roth]]) is a reasonable perspective. You may also consider the decision of whether to ''leave money inside'' an overfunded HSA that you can now withdraw tax-free as similar to deciding whether to invest in a [[non-deductible traditional IRA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Forum post|t=434227|title=Proposed update to Health Savings Account wiki page|date=22 Jun 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt; If you make a tax-free withdrawal from an HSA, you can reinvest an equal number of dollars in a [[taxable account]]. Although the balance would grow with tax drag, future gains are taxed at lower long-term capital gains rates. If the HSA is overfunded, future growth within the HSA will be taxable at higher ordinary income rates. And importantly, a taxable account gets a [[step-up in basis]] at your death, whereas an HSA does not. The decision to withdraw tax-free also depends on which assets you plan to hold in your HSA; [[Stock|stocks]] tend to perform better when reinvested in a taxable account, while [[Bond basics|bonds]] tend to perform better inside an HSA. See: [[Non-deductible_traditional_IRA#Taxable_account|Comparison between a non-deductible traditional IRA and a taxable account]]. 

If you reduce your projected HSA balance so that you no longer expect it to exceed available medical expenses, the HSA will switch to behaving more like a Roth account (albeit one you should spend down over your lifetime). Further tax-free withdrawals would be trading future tax-free growth for [[Taxable account|taxable]] growth and so would probably not be beneficial. Balancing your HSA balance and expenses regularly as you move through retirement is a good strategy.

==Inherited HSA==
===Spouse beneficiary===

When an HSA holder dies, a surviving spouse who is a beneficiary may assume the HSA as their own, and so reimburse qualified medical expenses of the deceased spouse after assuming ownership of the HSA, free of taxes.&lt;ref name="irs._Publ"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p969.pdf|title=Publication 969, Health Savings Accounts and Other Tax-Favored Health Plans|publisher=IRS|accessdate=June 25, 2024|page=10|quote=Spouse is the designated beneficiary: If your spouse is the designated beneficiary of your HSA, it will be treated as your spouse’s HSA after your death.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Non-spouse beneficiary===

The rules for a non-spouse beneficiary, however, are more complicated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Forum post|t=133792|title=HSA as stealth IRA - Inheritence issue|date=25 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="theb_What"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Choosing Beneficiaries for Your Health or Medical Savings Account | first = Julie | last = Garber | work = The Balance | date = 6 March 2017 | accessdate = 2017-11-04 | url = https://www.thebalance.com/choosing-beneficiaries-for-your-hsa-msa-3505285 | language =  en-us | quote =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Forum post|t=141799|title=After death, is an HSA still an HSA?|date=25 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fair_Fair"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Fairmark Forum :: Retirement Savings and Benefits :: HSA non-spouse beneficiary | author = Spirit Rider | work = fairmark.com | date = 10 September 2013 | accessdate = 2017-11-04 | url = https://fairmark.com/forum/read.php?2,70839 | language = EN | quote =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Forum post|t=221783 | title=HSA beneficiary options (tax considerations) | date=23 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the HSA account-holder dies and does not leave the account to their spouse, the entire value of the HSA becomes taxable to the beneficiary in that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p969.pdf|title=Publication 969, Health Savings Accounts and Other Tax-Favored Health Plans|publisher=IRS|accessdate=June 25, 2024|page=10|quote=Spouse isn’t the designated beneficiary: If your spouse isn’t the designated beneficiary of your HSA, the account stops being an HSA, and the fair market value of the HSA becomes taxable to the beneficiary in the year in which you die.}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the beneficiary may pay the decedent's ''unpaid'' medical expenses, and reduce the taxable amount by the amount paid within 1 year after the date of death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p969.pdf|title=Publication 969, Health Savings Accounts and Other Tax-Favored Health Plans|publisher=IRS|accessdate=June 25, 2024|page=10|quote=The amount taxable to a beneficiary other than the estate is reduced by any qualified medical expenses for the decedent that are paid by the beneficiary within 1 year after the date of death.}}&lt;/ref&gt; If you leave the account to your estate, the value is included on your final income tax return.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p969.pdf|title=Publication 969, Health Savings Accounts and Other Tax-Favored Health Plans|publisher=IRS|accessdate=June 25, 2024|page=10|quote=If your estate is the beneficiary, the value is included on your final income tax return.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike an [[Stretch IRA|inherited IRA]] or [[401(k)]], an HSA inherited by a non-spouse ceases to be a tax-advantaged account, and qualified medical expenses incurred by the decedent can no longer be reimbursed tax-free. As a result, from an estate planning perspective, an HSA has no more value to a non-spouse, non-charitable beneficiary than an equal amount of taxable income, and much less value than an equal amount of cash. For this reason, you should plan to spend down your HSA roughly over your lifetime, and not wait until you are too old to withdraw for past medical expenses. See [[#How_to_use_the_plan/Withdrawing_in_retirement|Withdrawing in retirement]] for strategies on how to mitigate the HSA's estate planning characteristics, and [[#Overfunded_HSA|Overfunded HSA]] for strategies to deal with an HSA that is larger than available qualified medical expenses.

==Advantages==

HSAs are unique among investment accounts in that they can be fully tax-free (contribution, growth, and withdrawal) when used for qualified medical expenses. As most investors will have substantial medical expenses over their lifetime, HSAs provide an opportunity for substantial tax savings compared to using other accounts. Many HSAs are available with great low-cost investment options consistent with [[Bogleheads®_investment_philosophy|Bogleheads®-style investing]]. 

As with a [[Flexible spending arrangement|flexible spending account]], an HSA allows you to contribute tax-deductible dollars and spend them tax-free on medical costs. However, money in a flexible spending account is lost if not used within a grace period after the end of the year, so you can only use it for expected expenses and will pay unexpected medical expenses with after-tax dollars. The HSA allows you to pay all your expenses with pre-tax dollars as long as they fit within the HSA limit, and what is not used continues to roll over to following years.

==Disadvantages==

The main potential disadvantage of the HSA is not the account itself, but the [[High deductible health plan|high-deductible plan]] that goes with it. If you have very low expenses, the high deductible does not matter; if you have very high medical costs, the plan must have a catastrophic maximum out-of-pocket cost which may also save you money. If your expenses are near the deductible, you may be better off without the HSA, using a conventional plan instead. HSAs are not available from all major fund companies, and often have maintenance fees, but there are some good ones in the [[Health_savings_account#HSA_custodians_and_options |HSA custodians and options]] section just below.

As an account, the main disadvantage of HSAs is their poor estate planning characteristics. When left to a non-spouse, the right to withdraw for past medical expenses of the owner is lost, and the entire balance becomes taxable in a single year (although leaving the HSA to a charitable organization eliminates any tax). These characteristics drive the [[#How_to_use_the_plan|strategies]] on how to best use an HSA. See [[Health_savings_account#Inherited HSA|Inherited HSA]] for details.

An HSA may be challenging for someone without a sufficient emergency fund; see [[Prioritizing investments]]. In contrast to an [[Flexible_spending_arrangement#Distributions_from_an_FSA|FSA]] where the entire amount may be available on January 1 each year, funds for an HSA are not available until they are deducted from your paycheck over the course of the year. 

To maximize the tax benefits of the HSA, you may need to store medical receipts for many years or decades before requesting reimbursement. This creates extra work, with the risk that records could be lost, degraded, or destroyed. Filing for reimbursement in the distant future is more difficult than seamless immediate reimbursement when an insurance company directly bills the HSA provider.

|-
! Tax structure
|HSAs are “triple tax-free” when used for qualified medical expenses: contributions are deductible, growth is tax-protected, and qualified withdrawals are tax-free. Non-qualified withdrawals after age 65 are penalty-free but taxable, so the account behaves like a pre-tax retirement account in this case.||Deductible retirement account contributions are taxable when withdrawn. Roth contributions are taxable when made but tax-free with withdrawn. [[Non-deductible traditional IRA|Non-deductible IRAs]] are a special case.||HSAs are fully tax-free in the most common case where sufficient medical expenses are available. In the worst case when they are not, the HSA behaves like a pre-tax retirement account. For this reason, HSAs will be as good or better than retirement accounts for taxes, and investors should usually [[#Contribution_priority_compared_to_other_accounts|contribute to an HSA first]].
|-
! [[State income taxes|State taxes]]
|HSA contributions are tax-deductible in all income-taxing states except for California and New Jersey.||Massachusetts does not allow deductions for [[traditional IRA]] contributions, but they do for all other pre-tax retirement accounts (401k, 403b, etc.). New Jersey does not allow deductions for contributions to retirement accounts ''except'' for a pre-tax 401k. Pennsylvania does not allow any retirement account deductions, but does not tax retirement withdrawals, so they behave like Roth accounts for state tax purposes. Alabama, Colorado, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, and New York exclude some federally-taxable retirement withdrawals from taxation. Illinois, Iowa, and Mississippi do not tax any distributions from retirement accounts, but allow deductions for pre-tax contributions. Georgia has a large exemption for all income in retirement, making retirement withdrawals tax-free for many retirees. Other income-taxing states follow federal tax rules for retirement accounts.||Investors in California or New Jersey will probably still come out ahead using an HSA for medical expenses compared to a retirement account.
|-
! [[Payroll - FICA tax deductions|Payroll taxes]]
|HSA contributions made through an [[Payroll - cafeteria plan deductions|employer payroll deduction]] are payroll tax-deductible. Contributions made directly to a HSA custodian are not.||Retirement plan contributions are not payroll tax-deductible, except for employer contributions to an employer plan.||Investors above the second Social Security [[Social Security as an investment|bend point]] and/or above the Social Security Wage Base will see an advantage with the payroll tax deduction. Investors who do not want to avoid payroll tax can contribute directly to the HSA custodian. HSAs have the advantage.

|Employers will sometimes contribute a fixed amount into employees’ HSAs, but usually not based on matching calculations. ||Employers will sometimes offer a [[Employer matching contributions|match]] for employer plan contributions. IRAs do not get a match. ||Employer plan, if matching is offered. Getting an employer match should be a top [[Prioritizing investments|financial priority]].

Some plans have a [[Self directed brokerage account|brokerage option]] allowing trading of stocks and ETFs, and occasionally a plan will have unusual investments (a [[Stable value fund|stable value fund]], annuities, real estate funds, etc.) that could be uniquely valuable to certain investors. IRAs offer a wide variety of investments. Self-directed retirement accounts offer an even wider range of investments.||Plan-dependent. IRAs usually have an advantage over employer plans and HSAs. But, there are plenty of HSAs and employer plans with sufficient variety of good investments to build a portfolio.
|-
! Fees
|Most HSAs have modest fees in the 0.3%/year range, and may also require a certain balance to be kept in cash rather than invested. Investors can choose their own HSA custodian, and at least one offers fee-free HSAs ([[#Fidelity|Fidelity]]), but if it is not the custodian chosen by your employer, you will lose the payroll tax deduction by contributing directly.||Employer plans can have high fees (~1-2%+ per year), but plan fees have come down on average in recent decades, and many have no fees except those within the offered mutual funds. Most IRA custodians offer fee-free IRAs.||Depends on the plan. HSAs tend to have higher fees than IRAs and good workplace plans, but are usually better than bad workplace plans. You can choose a fee-free HSA custodian (like [[#Fidelity|Fidelity]]), but if you contribute through an employer, you will have to periodically roll over money into your preferred custodian.
|-
! Compatibility with [[Backdoor Roth|Backdoor Roth IRA]]
|HSA balances do not interfere with the Backdoor Roth IRA.||Pre-tax traditional (along with SEP and SIMPLE) IRA balances ''do'' interfere with the Backdoor Roth IRA, but workplace plan balances do not.||HSAs have an advantage over deductible traditional IRAs. 
|-
! Early distribution options
| Tax- and penalty-free withdrawals are always allowed for current medical expenses, and past medical expenses that accrued after the HSA was established and for which you have saved the receipts. Otherwise, nonqualified HSA withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income and also charged a 20% penalty. The penalty is waived after age 65.||Withdrawals before age 59½ are charged a 10% penalty, with the following exceptions: disability, [[Substantially equal periodic payments|SEPP]], IRS levy, medical expenses, separation from service age 55 or older, and others. Plans may offer loans, hardship withdrawals, and/or in-service withdrawals, but whether these withdrawals incur penalties is subject to IRS rules. [[Roth IRA]] contributions can always be withdrawn tax- and penalty-free. Otherwise, early withdrawals are taxable and charged a 10% penalty.||Early HSA early withdrawals are more heavily penalized by paying twice the penalty rate, paying taxes that might otherwise not need to be paid, and the higher age limit. However, in practice most HSA owners will have plenty of medical expenses that can be used for qualified withdrawals, and those with [[#Overfunded_HSA|overfunded HSAs]] probably have other sources of funds, so this is not usually a serious disadvantage. 
|-
! [[Record retention]]
|When using an HSA as an investment account and leaving money in the account for tax-advantaged growth, you will need to save records for all medical expenses you incurred after the HSA was established. Storing and preserving these records over potentially many decades is not a trivial effort. ||Retirement accounts generally require minimal record retention. [[Roth IRA]] owners should keep a record of when the account was first established, contributions, and any [[Roth conversion|Roth conversions]], to avoid unnecessary taxes and penalties on [[Roth_IRA#Distributions|distributions]]. [[Traditional IRA]] owners making [[Non-deductible traditional IRA|non-deductible]] contributions need to keep track of their basis.||In order to realize the main tax benefits of an HSA, you may need to carefully keep records over long periods of time. If you are not confident you will be able to keep records, you should likely contribute to retirement accounts first. 
|-
! [[Asset protection|Asset protection]]&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Asset protection is a complex legal subject that is further complicated due to many laws being state-specific.

| HSAs do not receive federal protection from bankruptcy or creditors. Some states protect HSAs from bankruptcy and creditors but most do not.||ERISA 401(k) and 403(b) plans are protected from civil judgments and bankruptcy at the federal level. IRAs receive state-level protection from civil judgments, which [https://www.thetaxadviser.com/content/dam/tta/issues/2014/jan/stateirachart.pdf varies widely by state]. Traditional and Roth IRAs are exempt from federal bankruptcy up to $1.0M, and SEP and SIMPLE IRAs receive unlimited exemption.||HSAs are worse than ERISA employer plans. HSAs also tend to be worse than IRAs, but it is more state-dependent.
|-
! [[Required Minimum Distribution|Required Minimum Distributions]]
|HSAs have no Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs). ||Pre-tax retirement accounts have Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs) that start at age 73, except that employer plans (other than a Solo 401k) waive RMDs while you are still working. Roth accounts have no RMDs. || While HSAs do not have RMDs like pre-tax accounts, in practice due to the poor estate planning behavior of HSAs, you are usually best-off spending your HSA over your lifetime so the lack of RMDs is not much of an advantage.
|-
! Inheritance
| Spouses can [[#Spouse_beneficiary|inherit an HSA]] and treat it as their own, and can withdraw tax-free based on their own medical expenses and those of their deceased spouse for which they have receipts. If [[#Non-spouse_beneficiary|left to a non-spouse]], the entire HSA becomes taxable income in a single year, and the right to withdraw tax-free based on any past medical expenses is lost.||Spouses are generally allowed to treat inherited retirement accounts as their own.

==HSA custodians and options==
This list is not complete; please add others. Custodians are listed in alphabetical order.

===Alliant Credit Union (HealthEquity)===
[https://www.alliantcreditunion.org/depositsinvestments/healthsavings/ Alliant Credit Union] has no fees to open the account, no monthly or management fees, no transaction fees, free checks, free VISA debit card, no minimums, no fees to close the account. Alliant is ideal for a "cash" HSA to pay ongoing medical expenses or a starter HSA while you build towards an "investment" HSA.  The HSA can be invested for a $5.95 monthly fee, with at least $1000 remaining in the cash account.  Options include several Vanguard funds.

Note: Starting October 5, 2017, Alliant's HSA will be transitioned to HealthEquity. See this {{Forum post|t=227963|title=Alliant Credit Union no longer offering HSAs as of 11/9}} and [https://www.healthequity.com/alliant/members/ Alliant HSAs now administered by HealthEquity].

===BenefitWallet===

As of April 2024, BenefitWallet HSAs have been transitioned to [[#Health_Equity|HealthEquity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www2.healthequity.com/benefitwallet2/members/|title=Welcome to HealthEquity|publisher=HealthEquity|accessdate=July 7, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Discovery Benefits (WEX) ===

The Discovery Benefits (Wex) HSA is only offered through employer plans.

Terms and fees may vary from one company to another, so be sure to verify this information for your own employer. To view the fee schedule, log in to your account, then click the "Get Help" link which takes you into a help site. From there, in the search function search for "fee". You should see a search result for "Article ID: PROD-2175 | Health Savings Account (HSA) custodial management fee FAQ" which explains the general fees.

For at least one Discovery Benefits HSA member, the "The custodial management fee is a flat fee of 25 basis points per year that is assessed quarterly. This equates to 0.0625% each quarter on any dollars currently invested in mutual funds... The HealthcareBank interest-bearing account is excluded from this fee." There are no low-balance fees in the savings account, or other fees. As noted, the fee schedule may vary from one company to another, depending on the terms negotiated between each company and Discovery Benefits.

If your HSA balance is low, then the fees are lower than many employer-based HSAs that charge a flat monthly fee. But since the fee is assessed as a percentage on your balance, then the higher your balance, the greater your fees. For this reason, if you wish to avoid these fees, it would be advisable to perform an annual HSA transfer or rollover to a no-fee HSA.

==== Discovery Benefits Investment Platform ====

The investing platform is available for any HSA balance over $1,000. You can set up automated investing so that any balance over the minimum is automatically invested. The platform contains multiple Vanguard index funds in the institutional share class, as well as Target Retirement date funds.

===WageWorks===
[https://www.wageworks.com WageWorks] is a an employee benefits system that includes an HSA. Unlike Fidelity, Lively and many other HSA custodians, an individual HSA holder cannot enroll in WageWorks independently of their job, only through their employer.

A WageWorks HSA has a low-interest FDIC-insured savings account and an optional separate investment account on the BNY Mellon platform for HSA investing. In order to invest, you must maintain at least $1,000 in the savings account, with any balance above that available for optional investing.

====WageWorks HSA Fees====
Depending on the specific terms of your plan, you might pay a $2.00 monthly fee if the balance in the savings account is under $5,000; some employers may pay all or part of this fee for their employees. There are no investment trading fees or fees to use the investment platform, beyond standard mutual fund expense ratios. WageWorks also charges an additional $3.95 monthly fee for account holders who are no longer employed by their employers; as such, an individual who is enrolled in a WageWorks HSA and who leaves their employer should transfer out of WageWorks to a different custodian and close their WageWorks HSA. Additionally, there is a $16.00 transfer of asset (TOA) to another custodian fee.&lt;ref name="smar_"&gt;{{Cite web |title=WageWorks HSA Fee Schedule |author= |work=smart-hsa.com |date=1 April 2016 |access-date=22 January 2019 |url= https://www.smart-hsa.com/pdf/getpdf.asp?id=WW-0601_CustodyDisclosureDoc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====WageWorks HSA Investing====
In the investment platform, there are approximately 35 mutual funds in the following asset classes: Large Cap US Equity, Small and Mid-Cap US Equity, International Equity, Fixed Income, and All-in-One (target date and two Vanguard LifeStrategy funds).

Of interest to Boglehead investors are the following [[The Vanguard Group|Vanguard]] index funds, which are the only index funds in the platform:

* Vanguard 500 Index Admiral ({{MStarFundLink|VFIAX}})
* Vanguard Small Cap Index Admiral ({{MStarFundLink|VSMAX}})
* Vanguard Developed Markets Index Admiral ({{MStarFundLink|VTMGX}})
* Vanguard Emerging Markets Index Admiral ({{MStarFundLink|VEMAX}})
* Vanguard Short Term Investment Grade ({{MStarFundLink|VFSTX}})
* Vanguard Long-Term Bond Index Investor ({{MStarFundLink|VBLTX}})
* Vanguard LifeStrategy Moderate Growth Investor ({{MStarFundLink|VSMGX}})
* Vanguard LifeStrategy Conservative Growth Investor ({{MStarFundLink|VSCGX}})

Note that only the two listed [[Vanguard LifeStrategy Funds]] are included; Vanguard has two other LifeStrategy funds (Income and Growth) but they are not available in WageWorks. The other WageWorks funds are actively managed funds.

A WageWorks account holder may configure their account to automatically invest new contributions into designated funds, for hands-off account management.

# Your Social Security records
# Retirement
# Medicare
# Disability and [[Planning for disabled adult children#Supplemental Security Income (SSI)|SSI]]
# Widows, widowers and other survivors
# Get help with your situation

Details on how the retirement benefit is computed can be found at [http://www.ssa.gov/pubs/10070.html Your Retirement Benefit: How It Is Figured].

==Planning Social Security benefits==

Under the rules of Social Security, your Primary Insurance Amount (PIA) is defined as the benefit you receive in the month of your Full Retirement Age (FRA).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/COLA/piaformula.html Primary Insurance Amount], from the Social Security Administration.&lt;/ref&gt; If you claim benefits earlier or later than your Full Retirement Age, the amount you will receive will be lower or higher than the Primary Insurance Amount.

Therefore, the amount of the benefit you receive is based on calculations determined by:

* Your Primary Insurance Amount at Full Retirement Age
* Claiming Social Security earlier or later than your Full Retirement Age
** Benefits will be lower if claimed earlier
** Benefits will be higher if claimed later

For each month that you begin before your FRA, you reduce your benefit by 5/9 of 1%. For example, if your FRA is 66, you reach this age on December 9, and you elect to begin your benefit on June 9, the reduction to your benefit would be 6 × 5/9 × 1% = 3.33%. This monthly reduction rate occurs for the first 36 months that you begin prior to your FRA. After 36 months, it is 5/12 of 1% per month. The only other factors that would change the 5/9 of 1% reduction would be if the individual has earned income in the previous year, as the PIA will not include this, and the annual inflation adjuster for the new year.  

If you delay starting your retirement or old-age benefit past FRA, you earn Delayed Retirement Credits and get a larger benefit.  Wife, husband, widow, and widower benefits are also reduced if started before FRA (using different formulas), but are not increased by waiting past FRA to start.

{{Notice| The Social Security Administration has an illustrative table which shows the effects of early or late retirement. See: [{{{url|http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/ProgData/ar_drc.html}}} Early or delayed retirement].

For example, you were born in 1951. If you decided to retire at 66 (your full retirement age), you would get 100% of your retirement benefits.

If you decided to retire early at 63, you would get 80% of your benefits.

Delaying retirement beyond the age of 66 will increase your benefit by 8% of your Primary Insurance Amount / year. Waiting one year (until 67), results in receiving a benefit of 108%, which is 8% more than if you had taken retirement at 66. Waiting until 68 results in a benefit of 116%, which is 7.4% more than if you had started at 67.}}

Social Security is unisex and roughly actuarially fair. If you are a single unisex person of average health, it doesn't matter when you take it. There is a rough trade-off between fewer dollars for more years (start early) and more dollars for fewer years (start late). 

Since females outlive males on average, single males will live fewer years than a unisex person and should take it earlier; single females will live more years than a unisex person and should take it later. 

Since widows and widowers get the greater of their own benefit and their deceased spouse's benefit,&lt;ref group="note"&gt;A surviving spouse or child may receive a special lump-sum death payment of $255 if they meet certain requirements. Apply within two years of the date of death. See: [http://www.ssa.gov/survivorplan/ifyou7.htm Survivors Planner: A Special Lump-Sum Death Payment]&lt;/ref&gt; married couples have to consider their joint life. A high earning male with a low earning wife should wait to collect the higher benefit, not because he will live long enough to make up for what he gives up by not starting early, but because his wife will. 

All benefits are subject to the earnings test if you are under Full Retirement Age.  Your benefits will be reduced depending on your earnings for the year.  Your wife (husband) may also have her wife (his husband) benefits that are based on your work record reduced by your earnings.  The earnings test does not apply once you reach Full Retirement Age.

Here is a concrete question from the forums that shows the potential complexity of Social Security planning, which may not be fully applicable anymore to those who turn 62 after Jan 2, 2016 due to the new deemed filing rules: 

{{quotation|
Wife and I are same age, 62 this summer. Her SS that she qualifies for on her own is about half mine. The wrinkle is she still is working. Her 35 highest years have a lot of zeros, so each year she works will replace a zero. I am retired and when I turn 62 my pension drops by more than half, called a level income option because it assume SS will be started at 62. We need to make up some of the income lost by the drop in pension. Wife contributes 1000 per month to her 401(k) so we can stop that. Having her file for SS as the link suggests might be an option but she plans to work to age 66. Her salary is very modest but her job provides us health benefits. Do you think this "Team Play" technique would work for us or does it assume both spouses are not working?}}

The full answer: 

{{quotation|
The Team Play described assumes neither is working at 62, and turned 62 before January 2, 2016. There are several issues for you to consider. 

Her own benefits: 
If your wife is going to continue to work for the health benefits, then it doesn't make sense for her to apply for her own benefits before age 66 if she makes much more than $20,000. The earnings limit for 2009 is $14,160 - for every $2 over the limit, $1 is withheld from benefits. If her benefit at age 62 would be $800 a month ($9,600 a year), she would get to keep none of her social security if she makes $33,360 ($19,200 over the limit - benefits reduced by $9,600). 

Spousal benefits: 
When you reach 66, you can either file or file and suspend (''File and suspend is not of benefit under the new tax law''). Your wife can then apply for wife's benefits on your record. At 66, she will get half of your PIA (age 66 benefit) if her own PIA is a lesser amount. If your PIA is $1,800 a month and hers is $800, she can get $900 as a wife. If hers is $1,000, she won't get a wife's benefit, but she will get her own $1,000 (this assumes that she starts benefits at 66 - it is possible for her to delay her own benefits while collecting spousal benefits). Since she is still working and replacing some of those zero years, she may well end up with a PIA greater than 1/2 of yours (in spite of your statement that her benefit is about 1/2 of yours, that may not be true after her additional earnings are included in her calculation). You however, could follow part of the team play plan. When your wife applies for her own benefits at age 66, you can apply for your husband's benefit while delaying your own benefit. If her benefit is $800, you could get $400 at age 66 as her husband. By not taking your $1,800 at 66, you will increase the amount you eventually get at 70 (assuming you delay the maximum).}}

==Some basic rules about eligibility==
*If you apply for your own benefit before your Full Retirement Age and you are eligible for a spousal benefit at that time, you are presumed or deemed to have applied for a wife or husband's benefit at the same time.&lt;ref group="note" name="ObliviousInvestor"&gt;Exception: If you are younger than 62 as of 1 Jan 2016, deemed filing can occur beyond full retirement age as well. Specifically, if you apply for retirement benefits at any time and you are also eligible at that time for a spousal benefit, you will be deemed to have filed for your spousal benefit as well. In addition, if you are entitled to your retirement benefit at any time and you later become eligible for a spousal benefit, you will be deemed to have filed for your spousal benefit when you become eligible. (Ref: [https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=2700523#p2700523 Re: Changes to Social Security], [[Mike Piper]], Nov 27, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;
*If you apply for a wife or husband's benefit before your Full Retirement Age and you are eligible for a spousal benefit at that time, you are presumed or deemed to have applied for your own benefit at the same time.&lt;ref group="note" name="ObliviousInvestor" /&gt;
*You are ''entitled'' to a benefit if you are ''eligible'' and apply.
*You can suspend your old-age (retirement) benefit and earn Delayed Retirement Credits if you are Full Retirement Age.
*If you suspend your old-age benefit, you remain entitled to it even if no payments are made.
*You are eligible for a wife or husband's benefit if your spouse is entitled to old-age or disability benefits and&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Exception: If your spouse has suspended his/her retirement benefit, and the suspension request was made after 29 Apr 2016, you will not be eligible for a spousal benefit during the period of suspension. (Ref: [https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=2700121#p2700121 Re: Changes to Social Security], [[Mike Piper]], Nov 26, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;
#You have been married for a year (or other special cases),
#You are 62 or have in care a child under 16 receiving child's benefits (or a qualifying disabled adult child receiving [[Planning for disabled adult children#Social Security Disability Income - Disabled Adult Child (SSDI-DAC)|SSDI-DAC benefits)]] based on your spouse's record,
#You are not entitled to an old-age or disability benefit based on a primary insurance amount that is equal to 1/2 or more of your spouse's.
*You can withdraw your application within 12 months of your original entitlement:
#You must pay back all benefits receive by you or your family that depend on the application.
#You must get the consent of anyone receiving benefits based on the application; for example, your spouse.
#You can only withdraw one application in your lifetime.

==Some additional notes and examples on spouse benefit==
(''Additional strategies to increase benefits may be available for those who turned 62 before Jan 2, 2016'')
*Self benefits are those benefits based on your own work record.
*Spouse benefits are those benefits based on your spouse’s work record.
*Self and spouse benefits are separate and the calculations are applied to each separately.
*Your available benefit is the combination of your own benefit and your spouse benefit.
*The benefit calculations are based on the PIA (Primary Insurance Amount), FRA (Full Retirement Age) and the number of months before or after FRA that self and spouse begin receiving benefits.
*Any benefit increase or decrease (in percentage terms) due to taking, or deemed to be taking, a self or spouse benefit earlier or later than FRA, is permanent.
*A spouse benefit is only available if one spouse’s PIA is less than half of the other spouse’s PIA. The spouse benefit (SB) is the difference between half of the higher earning spouse’s PIA (PIA1) and the lower earning spouse’s PIA (PIA2), that is SB = Max(0, PIA1 / 2 &amp;minus; PIA2)
*You cannot take your own benefit or your spouse benefit before age 62.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;An exception is the spousal child in care benefit, for a child or a disabled adult child, in which the spouse may receive spousal child in care benefits prior to 62 years old.

[https://www.ssa.gov/oact/quickcalc/spouse.html Social Security - Benefits for Spouses]

&lt;/ref&gt;
*You cannot take your spouse benefit unless your spouse is taking their own benefit.
*You are deemed to have taken your spouse benefit if you and your spouse are taking your own benefits, even if you have not formally applied for the spouse benefit and are not, in fact, even receiving the spouse benefit. 
*If you are taking a spouse benefit, you are deemed to be taking your own benefit. 
*If you take, or are deemed to take, your own benefit at your FRA, you will receive an amount equal to your PIA. 
*If you take, or are deemed to take, your own benefit before your FRA, your benefit is reduced by 5/9% per month for each of the first 36 months and 5/12% per month for each month beyond 36 months that you choose to receive your benefit before FRA.
*If you take, or are deemed to take, your own benefit after your FRA, your benefit is increased by 2/3% per month for each month after FRA that you choose to receive your benefit, up to, but not including, age 70.
*If you take, or are deemed to take, your spouse benefit at your FRA, you will receive your full spouse benefit.
*If you take, or are deemed to take, your spouse benefit before your FRA, your spouse benefit is reduced by 25/36% per month for each of the first 36 months and 5/12% per month for each month beyond 36 months that you choose to receive your spouse benefit before FRA.
*If you take your spouse benefit after your FRA, there is no change to the benefit.

===Examples===
'''Situation'''
*Husband's PIA: $3,000
*Wife's PIA: $1,000
*Wife's FRA: 67
*Husband’s FRA: 67 (note that the wife’s spouse benefit does not depend on when the husband takes his benefit in relation to his FRA, but does in relation to her FRA)

Wife’s full spouse benefit is ($3,000 / 2 &amp;minus; $1,000) = $500

'''Case 1''' (wife takes at 62, husband already taking)
Her own reduced benefit is:
*5/9% &amp;times; 36 = 20%
*5/12% &amp;times; 24 = 10%
*Total early claim deduction for her own benefit = 30%
*(100 &amp;minus; 30)% &amp;times; $1,000 = $700

Her reduced spouse benefit is:
*25/36% &amp;times; 36 = 25%
*5/12% &amp;times; 24 = 10%
*Total early claim deduction for spousal benefit = 35%
*(100 &amp;minus; 35)% &amp;times; $500 = $325

Her combined total benefit, starting at age 62 = $700 + $325 = $1,025

'''Case 2''' (wife takes at 62, husband starts taking when wife is 67 (FRA))
*Wife will get her own reduced benefit of $700 between ages 62 and 67.
*Wife will get full spouse benefit of $500 at age 67.

Her combined total benefit, starting at age 67 = $700 + $500 = $1,200

'''Case 3''' (wife takes at 67, husband already taking)
*Wife will get her own full benefit of $1,000
*Wife will get full spouse benefit of $500

Her combined total benefit = $1,000 + $500 = $1,500

==Some computational and payment details==
The following details are taken from the SSA [https://secure.ssa.gov/apps10/poms.nsf/partlist Program Operations Manual System]:
*Benefits are rounded down to the nearest dollar.
*All reductions and credits are computed using fractions, not percents.  Someone who starts a retirement benefit 6 months early will have a reduction of 6 &amp;times; 5/9% or 30/900 = 1/30.  For a PIA of $1,723.40, the benefit would be 1723.4 &amp;times; 29/30 = 1665.95 rounded down to the nearest whole dollar or $1,665.  Using a reduction of 3.33% would give an answer of 1723.4 &amp;times; 96.67% = 1666.01, which would seem to yield a benefit of $1,666 a month. This is incorrect.
*The COLA is computed in percents to one decimal place, for example, the 2009 COLA was 5.8%.  The COLA is applied to your PIA, not your benefit.
*When the PIA is computed, it is rounded down to the nearest $0.10.  For example, when a COLA of 5.8% is applied to a PIA of $1,723.40, the new PIA is 1723.4 &amp;times; 1.058 = 1823.36 rounded down to 1823.30.  With a reduction of 1/30 for starting a retirement benefit 6 months early, the new benefit will be 1823.3 &amp;times; 29/30 = 1762.52 rounded down to $1,762.  The actual increase in the retirement benefit is (1762 &amp;minus; 1665) / 1665 = 5.826%.  With another PIA, the benefit could go up slightly less than 5.8%.
*If you delay retirement past your full retirement age, the delayed credits are applied in January of the following year or in the month of attainment of age 70 if applicable.  For example, if your full retirement age is 66 and you apply for retirement benefits on your birthday in March at age 68, your initial benefit will include 22 months of delayed credits.  The additional 2 months of delayed credits for January and February will be applied the following January and affect monthly payments thereafter, but you will not receive any lump sum to make up for the amounts "missing" from the payments in that first calendar year.  Filing for your benefit to begin in January (received in Feb) means that no months are "missed," and filing for your benefit to begin in July is worst in terms of the number of months missed.  See the first link in the [[#Forum discussions|Forum discussions]] section for details.
*Benefits are paid in the month following the month earned.  In a year with a COLA, the COLA is used to compute the December benefit paid in January.  Thus the 2009 COLA, while based on the increase in CPI-W from the third quarter of 2007 to the third quarter of 2008 and applied to the December 2008 benefit, is referred to as the 2009 COLA since it first showed up in the January 2009 benefit payment. 

==Taxation==
[https://www.ssa.gov/oact/cola/cbb.html Contribution and Benefit Bases] lists historical values for annual maximum wages on which Social Security ''taxes'' are levied. For 2025, the wage maximum is $176,100, and for 2026, it is $184,500.

[http://www.irs.gov/publications/p915/index.html IRS Publication 915, Social Security and Equivalent Railroad Retirement Benefits] is the IRS version of taxing Social Security ''benefits''. 

[[Taxation of Social Security benefits]] discusses several examples of SS benefit taxation.

==Social Security application==
Although Social Security generally says you can submit your application up to 3 months before you want to begin benefits, you may request benefits to start the month of filing, a month in the past (see retroactive benefits below), or up to 4 months in the future. This request is called the "Month of Election". Benefits ''start'' the "Month of Entitlement", defined as the month in which an individual has filed an application and Social Security has confirmed that age and earnings requirements have been met.&lt;ref&gt;[https://secure.ssa.gov/poms.nsf/lnx/0200204040 GN 00204.040 Month of Election (MOEL) and Month of Entitlement (MOET)], Program Operations Manual System (POMS), retrieved July 21, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Benefits are then ''paid'' the following month, [https://faq.ssa.gov/ics/support/kbanswer.asp?QuestionID=3745 based on your birth date] for applications since 1997.

Applications may be [https://secure.ssa.gov/iClaim/rib online] (recommended by the Social Security Administration&lt;ref&gt;Social Security Administration, [https://faq.ssa.gov/link/portal/34011/34019/Article/3734/How-do-I-apply-for-Social-Security-retirement-benefits "How do I apply for Social Security retirement benefits?"], ''Frequently Asked Questions'', retrieved July 24, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;), by phone (1-800-772-1213 or TTY 1-800-325-0778), or in person at your [https://secure.ssa.gov/ICON/main.jsp local Social Security office]. 

The following sections on Retroactive payments and restricted applications, Deemed filing, and Voluntary suspension are based on the many Forum contributions of [[Mike Piper]], Oblivious Investor.

===Retroactive payments===
For Social Security retirement applications filed after full retirement age (FRA), a retroactive lump sum benefit back to FRA or a maximum of six months is available.&lt;ref&gt;[https://secure.ssa.gov/poms.nsf/lnx/0200204030 GN 00204.030 Retroactivity for Title II Benefits], Program Operations Manual System (POMS), retrieved July 21, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

[https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=168328#p2533613 Forum threads] have discussed the possibility of an unwanted lump sum and reduced monthly benefits from Social Security's use of a retroactive entitlement date after FRA. To make sure that you receive all the delayed retirement credits you expect, your application should restrict its scope with "unequivocal" statements to make your intentions clear:

{{quotation|
'''GN 00204.020 Scope of the Application'''&lt;ref&gt;[https://secure.ssa.gov/poms.nsf/lnx/0200204020 GN 00204.020 Scope of the Application], Program Operations Manual System (POMS), retrieved July 21, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

. . . A claimant may choose to limit or restrict the scope of the application to exclude a class of benefits he or she may be eligible to on one or more SSNs for any reason (except where deemed filing applies). The reason may be to receive higher current benefits or to maximize the amount of benefits over a period of time, including the effect of delayed retirement credits (DRCs). (See RS 00615.480 for information on adjustment of the reduction factor.)

'''a. Before adjudication'''

The claimant must restrict the application before it is adjudicated.

'''b. Unequivocal statements'''

The claimant may restrict the application by completing appropriate blocks on the application or by signing an unequivocal statement that he or she does not wish to file for a specific benefit as follows:&lt;br&gt;
“I filed on (DATE) for all benefits for which I may be eligible except ___________”; or&lt;br&gt;
“I wish to exclude ________ benefits from the scope of this application.”&lt;br&gt;
Only unequivocal statements are acceptable. Qualifying phrases such as “at this time” or he or she plans to file in the future are not acceptable. . .}}

Sample statements to include in the application comments section would be:
{{blockquote|"I wish to receive my maximum benefit, including all delayed retirement credits to age 70. I do not wish to receive any retroactive payments based on a retirement age earlier than 70."}}

===Deemed filing===

As of April 30, 2016 the deemed filing rules apply to all applications, even if you have reached full retirement age. If you file for retirement benefits or spouse's benefits and you are also eligible for any other benefits at that time, you will be deemed to have filed for all benefits. This prevents using a restricted application to claim benefits on another's earnings record (for example, a spouse), while not claiming on your own earnings record. However, the new deemed filing rule, extending it to FRA and beyond, does not apply to those born before January 2, 1954.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ssa.gov/planners/retire/deemedfaq.html Deemed Filing For Retirement And Spouse’s Benefits FAQ's], retrieved February 9, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, deemed filing now applies automatically for anyone already receiving benefits when they become eligible for another benefit. Before April 30, 2016 deemed filing applied only when a new application was submitted.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=176706#p2672395 Changes to Social Security], Bogleheads Forum, retrieved July 21, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Voluntary suspension===

If you are already receiving Retirement Insurance Benefits (RIB) and have reached full retirement age, you can voluntarily suspend them to increase your payments with delayed retirement credits (DRCs). If you change your mind and want the payments to start before age 70, tell Social Security when you want your benefits reinstated (orally or in writing). Your request may include benefits for any months when your payments were suspended, but you will lose DRCs for any retroactive payments. Suspended payments will start automatically the month you reach age 70.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ssa.gov/planners/retire/suspend.html Retirement Planner: Suspending Retirement Benefit Payments], retrieved July 21, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|
'''GN 02409.130 Voluntary Suspension Reinstatement'''&lt;ref&gt;[https://secure.ssa.gov/apps10/poms.nsf/lnx/0202409130 GN 02409.130 Voluntary Suspension Reinstatement], Program Operations Manual System (POMS), retrieved July 21, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''A. Procedure for reinstatement at age 70'''

The Program Service Centers (PSC) use automated systems to process voluntary delayed retirement credit (VOLDRC) reinstatements at age 70. When we reinstate benefits at age 70, all VOLDRCs are credited immediately. We automatically select and process reinstatements to stop suspension with the month before the month the retirement insurance benefit (RIB) beneficiary attains age 70. For an explanation of the PSCs’ automated processes for voluntary suspension reinstatements, see SM 03020.250.

'''B. Procedure for reinstatement prior to age 70'''

The RIB beneficiary who requested suspension may at any time request benefit reinstatement as of any month in the suspension period. We will accept a written or oral request. There is no signature requirement.}}

As of April 30, 2016 the following changes apply while your benefits are suspended:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=176706#p2672395 Changes to Social Security], Bogleheads Forum, retrieved July 21, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;
# you cannot receive a benefit based on another’s earnings record, and 
# no one can receive a benefit based on your earnings record. 
These changes, along with the Deemed filing changes above, eliminated the “file and suspend” strategy allowing a spouse to collect spouse's benefits while continuing to earn DRCs on their own earnings record.

      <text bytes="19770" sha1="a4kfomdvh3t5lrth4vpif11tb98xa2r" xml:space="preserve">A '''safe withdrawal rate''' (SWR) is the quantity of money, expressed as a percentage of the initial investment, which you can withdraw per year from a portfolio, for a given quantity of time, including adjustments for inflation, without portfolio failure, where 'without failure' is a 95% probability of not running out of money at any time within the specified period.

'''Usage:''' A "safe withdrawal rate" is typically an approximation of the probability that a given portfolio can support a given annual spending component for a required period, with a reasonable confidence. To do this, you would use variables such as the allocation of assets within a model portfolio, the beginning balance, and/or the number of years expected in retirement are varied, apply a model to them, and then compare the results of altering these variables to optimize for the best outcome. 

'''Controversy:''' Unfortunately, the term "safe withdrawal rate" is ambiguous. This is because initial methods used historical data to statically determine what ''would have been'' safe, given the actual results that past portfolios would have generated with the variables given. The next logical step, of course, was to use that information to predict ''future'' SWRs. Either use is technically correct, but to avoid unnecessary arguments, you need to be clear if you use the term for past SWRs or projected SWRs.

==Studies and papers==
=== Trinity study === 
Philip L. Cooley, Carl M. Hubbard and Daniel T. Walz authored an early and influential paper, ''Retirement Savings: Choosing a Withdrawal Rate That Is Sustainable.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://incomeclub.co/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/retirement-savings-choosing-a-withdrawal-rate-that-is-sustainable.pdf| title=Retirement Savings: Choosing a Withdrawal Rate That Is Sustainable| publisher=AAII Journal| date=February 1998| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150702114906/https://incomeclub.co/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/retirement-savings-choosing-a-withdrawal-rate-that-is-sustainable.pdf| archive-date=July 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the authors were professors at Trinity University in San Antonio, Texas, it is often referred to as "the Trinity study." The authors studied actual historical stock and bond returns from 1926 through 1995 to determine sustainable withdrawal rates. The study has gained renewed significance in light of recent turbulent economy.

Using all of the historical data, the professors looked at five possible portfolio compositions, from 100 percent stocks to 100 percent bonds - the three other portfolios had a stock/bond allocation of: 75/25, 50/50, and 25/75 - and evaluated the impact of fixed annual withdrawals ranging from three percent to twelve percent. The [[S&amp;P 500 index]] represented stocks, and long-term high grade domestic bonds represented bonds.

Payout periods were in five-year intervals, from 15 to 30 years. In the study, the professors considered a portfolio successful if it ended a particular withdrawal period with a positive (not zero, and not negative) value.

The study produced a number of conclusions, including:

* Withdrawal periods longer than fifteen years dramatically reduced the probability of success at withdrawal rates exceeding five percent.
* Bonds increase the success rate for lower to mid level withdrawal rates, but most retirees would benefit with at least a 50 percent allocation to stocks.
* Retirees who want inflation-adjusted withdrawals must expect a substantially lower withdrawal rate from the initial portfolio.
* Stock-dominated portfolios using a three to four percent withdrawal rate may create rich heirs at the expense of the retiree's current standard of living.
* For a payout of fifteen years or less, a withdrawal rate of eight to nine percent from a stock-dominated portfolio appears sustainable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| publisher=New York Life| url=https://www.newyorklife.com/cda/0,3254,14198,00.html| title=Key to Making Retirement Savings Last: The Withdrawal Rate}}{{dead link}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="restud1"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.retireearlyhomepage.com/restud1.html| title=The Retire Early study on safe withdrawal rates| publisher=Retire Early Home Page| accessdate=November 13, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Limitations of the Trinity study===
One scenario backtested in the Trinity study suggests that a retiree with a suitably allocated $1&amp;nbsp;million portfolio could withdraw $40,000 the first year, give themselves a cost-of-living adjustment every year afterwards, and have a 98% chance of the portfolio lasting at least 30 years.

Taken literally, such a plan has been criticized as unrealistic. Even if the tests showed that the plan had a 98% success rate over all past time periods, would a prudent person blindly go on steadily increasing withdrawals in a prolonged bear market? It also leads to apparent absurdities. Suppose retirees Alice and Bob have saved $1&amp;nbsp;million in 2008, and the market crash reduces their portfolios to $800,000 in 2009. Alice, however, retires in 2008 while Bob waits until 2009. The Trinity study bases withdrawals the dollar value of the portfolio at the start of retirement. The value fluctuates with the vagaries of the stock market. As a result, even though their situations are almost identical, in the Trinity scenario, because Alice retired in 2008 she is allowed to withdraw $40,000 plus COLA in 2009; while Bob, despite being in an almost identical situation, would be allowed only $32,000. 

The authors of the paper, however, did not mean for their scenarios to be applied rigidly or uncritically. The article makes this very important statement:
{{quotation|The word ''planning'' is emphasized because of the great uncertainties in the stock and bond markets. Mid-course corrections likely will be required, with the actual dollar amounts withdrawn adjusted downward or upward relative to the plan. The investor needs to keep in mind that selection of a withdrawal rate is ''not'' a matter of ''contract'' but rather a matter of ''planning''.}}

[[User:Nisiprius | Nisiprius]] requested clarification from Professor Philip L. Cooley, senior author of the Trinity study:&lt;ref name="SWR"&gt;{{forum link| t=53956| title=What the Trinity Study authors meant}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quotation|What the "4% SWR" means is not that you can treat a portfolio as if it were a guaranteed annuity.

I think all the [Trinity] authors meant is that if it is late 2008 and your stocks halve in value, you don't need to halve your spending instantly. It's OK to cross your fingers and continue spending according to the 4%-then-COLAed plan, even though it means dipping into capital, and it's OK to go on doing that for a while.}}

This rule and its variants finance a constant, non-volatile spending plan using a risky, volatile investment strategy. As a result, retirees accumulate unspent surpluses when markets outperform and face spending shortfalls when markets underperform. The previous work on this subject has focused on the probability of short falls and optimal portfolio mixes. We will focus on the rule’s inefficiencies—the price paid for funding its unspent surpluses and the overpayments made to purchase its spending policy. We show that a typical rule allocates 10%-20% of a retiree’s initial wealth to surpluses and an additional 2%-4% to overpayments. Further, we argue that even if retirees were to recoup these costs, the 4% rule’s spending plan often remains wasteful, since many retirees may actually prefer a different, cheaper spending plan.}}

The following outline is provided as a topical overview of personal retirement plans:

'''Personal retirement plans''' include Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRA)s, annuities, and some forms of charitable split-interest gifts.

==IRA accounts==
An individual retirement arrangement, or IRA, is a personal savings plan which allows you to set aside money for retirement, while offering you tax advantages. You may be able to deduct some or all of your contributions to your IRA. Amounts in your IRA, including earnings, generally are not taxed until distributed to you. IRAs cannot be owned jointly. However, any amounts remaining in your IRA upon your death can be paid to your beneficiary or beneficiaries.

==Annuities==
 
===Deferred annuities===
Deferred annuities are used to accumulate assets. Funds will grow at a rate that can be either fixed or variable.

*'''Fixed annuity''': The money you put in a fixed annuity earns interest at a rate that is guaranteed for a specific period of time—ranging from one to five years or more, depending on the terms of the contract. When that period ends, a new rate may take effect—or the old rate may be offered again.
*'''Variable annuity''': With a variable annuity, your money is put in subaccount investments that are similar to stock and bond funds. The return on your investments is subject to the risk of market fluctuation. Your total account value depends on how much risk you take, the performance of the subaccounts, and what charges and fees are deducted.
An Equity-indexed annuity, also referred to as a fixed indexed annuity, is a type of fixed annuity where earnings accumulate at a rate based on a formula linked in part to a published equity-based index, such as the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500 Composite Stock Price IndexTM (S&amp;P 500). An indexed annuity provides a guarantee of a minimum accumulation value, and may also offer death benefit protection and a variety of payout options. The index used, the formula that determines the indexed rate and the guaranteed minimum value, can vary from insurer to insurer.

* [[Fixed annuity]]
* [[Variable annuity]]

===Immediate annuities===
Immediate (Income) annuities are used to convert a lump sum into an income stream (regular payments), typically for the life of the annuitant. If the income stream is fixed, it is considered a fixed immediate annuity; also known as a Single Premium Immediate Annuity (SPIA). Some fixed immediate annuities are offered with inflation-adjusted payments or graded payments that rise at a fixed rate, of for example, 3% annually. However, these options reduce the initial payment received but with the anticipation that payments will grow steadily over time. If the income stream is variable, it is considered a variable immediate annuity. Like deferred variable annuities, your money is put into subaccounts. These subaccounts can be invested in stock or bond funds. Payments will fluctuate based on the underlying subaccounts. With funds invested in stocks, it is possible that payments could grow at a rate higher than can be achieved by fixed immediate annuities.

* [[Immediate variable annuity]]

==Charitable split interest plans== 

A split-interest gift is any gift in which a portion is assigned to charity and a portion benefits the donor or their designee. Charitable gift annuities, pooled income funds, and charitable remainder trusts are all varieties of split-interest gifts.

      <text bytes="8557" sha1="cmi9x6gmi8lx1m5459dfxx9p8vs8f2x" xml:space="preserve">'''{{PAGENAME}}''' (TPAW) describes the "total portfolio" approach to asset allocation and withdrawal.

The total portfolio approach means that the present value of future savings and retirement income, valued using the safe bond rate, is counted as safe bonds in the portfolio. A fixed asset allocation is maintained on this "total portfolio." Retirement withdrawals are calculated by amortizing the total portfolio over retirement years ([[amortization based withdrawal]]).

The advantage of the total portfolio approach is that total risk is kept consistent from year to year. This has two benefits: 

# Risk is spread more evenly across years, reducing the total risk that the retiree would need to take to achieve a given expected return. 
# It prevents surprises like risk increasing unexpectedly as the real value of a pension declines and the retiree relies more heavily on the savings portfolio.

==Planner with Monte Carlo Simulation==

This planner uses Monte Carlo simulations to show the impact of planning choices. You adjust your plan until you are satisfied with the simulation results.

While the "Planner with Monte Carlo Simulation" repeats the simulation 500 times by drawing randomly from the given sequence of returns, this simulator calculates withdrawals for only the one given sequence of returns. This is useful for backtesting.

Because historical returns may not match your expectation of future returns, the following spreadsheet provides a way to reduce historical returns to obtain a sequence of returns that better matches your expectations:

==Theory==

=== Relation to Merton's strategy ===
The allocation and withdrawal strategy of TPAW aligns with the optimal allocation and withdrawal derived in Merton (1969)&lt;ref&gt;Merton, R. C. (1969). "Lifetime Portfolio Selection under Uncertainty: the Continuous-Time Case". ''The Review of Economics and Statistics''. '''51''' (3): 247–257&lt;/ref&gt;. This spreadsheet shows the link between the two strategies. You can enter the inputs for Merton's strategy and obtain the corresponding inputs for TPAW:

* Merton's inputs matched to TPAW inputs: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wj3hM-BCL0U0FOd9_nf-uz3_Vq0_1Jy4/edit?usp=sharing&amp;ouid=102598494905177370665&amp;rtpof=true&amp;sd=true Excel] or [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e1GUsfDn6CHEh8XpTyDJN0q1DmWz7UDIW2xHhUHZOyg/edit?usp=sharing Google Sheets]

=== Deviations from Merton's strategy ===
TPAW deviates from Merton's strategy in the following ways:

* ''No borrowing'': While Merton assumes borrowing, TPAW assumes no borrowing. If Merton's strategy calls for borrowing to invest (that is, an asset allocation of more than 100% stocks, likely early on in a career), TPAW uses an an asset allocation of 100% stocks instead. And if Merton's strategy calls for borrowing to consume (a possibility in early retirement before pensions begin), TPAW only withdraws whatever is available in the savings portfolio.

* ''Extra withdrawals'': Merton's model assumes no extra spending needs in any year. TPAW allows the user to schedule extra withdrawals in desired years through the "essential expenses funded by safe bonds" and the "extra withdrawals funded by risk portfolio" columns.
* ''No savings strategy'': Besides the optimal withdrawal strategy during retirement, Merton's model also gives the optimal savings strategy when working. TPAW takes savings as given and does not model the savings decision.

===Model with borrowing===
This spreadsheet implements TPAW with borrowing, which brings it closer to Merton's strategy. The assumption that you can borrow as much as you want simplifies calculations. Answers can be obtained with formulas and do not require simulations (for example, what is the probability of withdrawals falling below $40,000 at age 70?). But it is not directly implementable in a world with borrowing constraints, so be careful when using the spreadsheet to understand if and when borrowing is being assumed and the consequences of not being able to borrow as assumed. The larger the savings portfolio is relative to future income, the less likely the model is to require borrowing. The model is most likely to call for borrowing (to invest) in early career when the savings portfolio is at its lowest and future savings is at its highest. For people with large pensions relative to savings, it might also call for borrowing (to consume) in early retirement before Social Security and pensions start. You should use the "Planner with Monte Carlo Simulation" above to ensure that your strategy will work well without borrowing. If you do not want to explore the theory behind TPAW and are looking for the quickest route to an implementable strategy that does not involve borrowing, you can ignore this spreadsheet and rely solely on the "Planner with Monte Carlo Simulation" above to devise your strategy.

===Sequence of Return Risk===
Sequence of return risk is the risk that poor returns occur when a savings portfolio is large (typically around the start of retirement) and are not fully compensated by good returns that occur when the savings portfolio is small (typically early career and late retirement).  This leads to concern that a market crash right around retirement can permanently damage a retirement because portfolios are at their peak value and very sensitive to returns. TPAW manages this risk by maintaining a fixed asset allocation on the total portfolio and employing amortization based withdrawals. This results in a strategy that is well diversified across time, making the outcome less sensitive to the timing of returns. A crash and subsequent recovery would have no harmful effect on retirement even if it occurred just prior to retirement when the savings portfolio is at its peak. During retirement, no matter when the crash occurs, the loss would be limited to reduced income during the depressed years. The income will recover fully if and when the market recovers. There would be no permanent damage to the portfolio that persists after the market has recovered.
