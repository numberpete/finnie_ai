{{Notice|
If you are considering hiring an investment adviser (financial adviser, broker, or investment firm) it is important that you '''check their background credentials''' and any complaints on file. The SEC and FINRA offer free tools to help with this, discussed [[#Background checks | below]].
}}
'''Investment Advisers''' (IA)&lt;ref group=note&gt;U.S. financial law spelling uses ''adviser'', while elsewhere the spelling is ''advisor''.&lt;/ref&gt; are people or firms who are paid to give advice on investing in securities such as stocks, bonds, [[mutual fund]]s, or [[exchange-traded fund]]s (ETFs). Depending on their classification, ''Investment Adviser'' are regulated. For example, an ''Investment Adviser'' who registers with the [http://www.sec.gov/ Securities and Exchange Commission] (SEC) must follow a fiduciary standard to act in their client's best interest. An adviser registered with the SEC is known as a ''Registered Investment Adviser'' (RIA).

== Investment advisers ==
Although many of the people who work at advisory firms fall under the definition of "investment adviser," the SEC generally does not require them to register individually as advisers with the SEC. Instead, the advisory ''firm'' itself must register with the SEC. The firm's registration covers its employees ''and'' other people under its control, provided they are working on the firm's behalf.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.sec.gov/about/offices/oia/oia_investman/rplaze-042006.pdf| title=The Regulation of Investment Advisers| publisher=SEC.gov| date=November 22, 2006| accessdate=August 31, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, only firms can be ''Registered Investment Advisers'' (RIA), while its employees can only be ''Investment Adviser Representatives'' (IAR).&lt;ref&gt;{{forum link| p=1198928| title=A Firm is an RIA, Not a Person| date=October 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Registered Investment Advisers'' may not use the term “registered investment adviser” unless they are registered, nor can they use it to suggest a level of professional competence, education or special training. The term "RIA" should not appear after a person’s name, because using initials after a name usually indicates a degree or a licensed professional position requiring qualifications, and there are no federal qualifications for becoming an SEC-registered adviser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.sec.gov/divisions/investment/advoverview.htm| title=Information for Newly-Registered Investment Advisers| publisher=SEC.gov| date=November 23, 2010| accessdate=August 31, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, someone could not use "RIA" on their business card.&lt;ref&gt;{{forum link| t=83550| title=A Firm is an RIA, Not a Person| date=October 3, 2011| author=[[Rick Ferri]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Investment advisers who manage less than $100 million in assets must register with the state securities agency in the state where they have their principal place of business.&lt;ref name="RIA"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Registered_investment_adviser| title=Registered investment adviser| publisher=Wikipedia| accessdate=August 31, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anyone registered with the FINRA typically makes commissions and fees from the products they sell (brokerage or mutual fund company). They must provide their clients with products that are "[[#Suitability|suitable]]" (the suitability standard), but not necessarily the cheapest or the best.&lt;ref name="SECFin"&gt;{{forum link| p=1189157| title=Investment Advisor or do it ourselves| date=September 26, 2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulations==
Section 202(a)(11)(C) of the [[wikipedia:Investment Advisers Act of 1940|Investment Advisers Act of 1940]] exempts&lt;ref name="RIA" /&gt; from the definition of an ''Investment Adviser'' (and therefore the associated fiduciary standard){{blockquote|... any ''broker or dealer'' whose performance of such services is solely incidental to the conduct of his business as a broker or dealer and who receives no special compensation therefor.}}

In [https://www.sec.gov/file/release-nos-34-51523 Release 34-51523], the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) (the US Securities Self Regulatory Organization (SRO) with authority over ''Brokers and Dealers'') determined that Broker-Dealers are "not to be deemed investment advisers" and therefore are not required to follow the same fiduciary standards as ''Investment Advisers'' when recommending investments to clients (as are ''Registered Investment Advisers'' (RIA)).

Registered Representatives (RRs) affiliated with a [[wikipedia:Broker-dealer|Broker-dealer]] must therefore recommend securities that are deemed "[[#Suitability|suitable]]" for non-institutional clients.

===Suitability===
''Suitability'' means that a broker can sell ''any'' fund or any investment as long as it fits the purpose. For example, if stocks are suitable for an investor, then it does not matter if a broker advises an 8% load stock fund that has 3% in annual fees because it is agreed that stocks in general are a suitable, and so any diversified stock mutual fund will do.&lt;ref name="RF"&gt;{{forum link| p=1192950| title=Ameriprise employees sue firm for lousy 401k choices| date=September 30, 2011| author=[[Rick Ferri]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Suitability is entirely different from fiduciary standard. Under a fiduciary standard, an investment adviser must not only recommend suitable investments, but they must also recommend funds that are in the best interest of their client. Clearly, a fund with an 8% load and 3% in fees is not in the best interest of anyone. Low-cost index funds are in the best interest of clients.&lt;ref name="RF" /&gt;

This is the difference between a broker's investment recommendations under a ''suitability'' standard, and an investment adviser's recommendations under a ''fiduciary'' standard.&lt;ref name="RF" /&gt;

===Fiduciary standard===
On April 8, 2016, the Department of Labor issued revised regulations which widens the definition of a ''fiduciary'' for advisers who have control over retirement plans. This aims to avoid a conflict of interest between an adviser (including a broker-dealer) and the client. Firms must have complied with these new rules by July 1, 2019. Before July 1, 2019, advisers could ''intend'' to comply with these rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ebsa/ebsa20171127-0| title=U.S. Department of Labor Extends Transition Period For Fiduciary Rule Exemptions| publisher=US Department of Labor| accessdate=August 31, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Before July 1, 2019, the Department of Labor did not pursue claims against fiduciaries who worked diligently and in good faith to comply with the Fiduciary Rule.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background checks==
If you are considering hiring an investment adviser (financial adviser, broker, or investment firm) it is important that you '''check their background credentials''' and any complaints on file. The SEC and FINRA offer free tools to help you do this.

It is a good idea for you to use both tools. If you cannot find a financial adviser in the SEC's Investment Adviser Public Disclosure (IARD) database, but you do find them in FINRA's Broker Check, you can consider this adviser to be a product salesperson.&lt;ref name="SECFin" /&gt;

===SEC Investment Adviser Public Disclosure===
The SEC's Investment Adviser Public Disclosure (IAPD) database provides information about current and former Investment Adviser Representatives (IARs) and Investment Adviser firms registered with the SEC and/or state securities regulators.&lt;ref name="IAS"&gt;[http://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=1188999#p1188999 Investment Advisor or do it ourselves], forum discussion, direct link to post.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[https://adviserinfo.sec.gov/ Investment Adviser Search], from the [http://www.sec.gov/ SEC]
Choose either ''Individual'' or ''Firm'' to start. Be sure browser cookies are enabled. The results will contain links to "Investment Adviser Firm" or "Brokerage Firm" as applicable.

====Brokerage firm====
The Brokerage Firm link will launch into the FINRA's BrokerCheck ([[#FINRA BrokerCheck |below]]) which provides additional information such as a state-by-state breakdown where a broker is licensed to practice, or if any complaints have been filed.

====Investment adviser firm====
The "Investment Adviser Firm" link goes to Form ADV (Uniform Application for Investment Adviser Registration), each section appearing in a menu on the left-hand side. Among other items, you can use Form ADV to see if a firm offers [[Financial planning | financial planning]], as opposed to providing investment advice.&lt;ref name="Kennedy"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://simplesmartinvesting.com/?p=175| title=How to select an investment adviser| date=March 10, 2013| author=Ian Kennedy| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313201150/http://simplesmartinvesting.com/?p=175| archive-date=March 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Go to "Item 5 Information About Your Advisory Business" in the ADV form and look for:

*5F(1): Do you provide continuous and regular supervisory or management services to securities portfolios? 

If the answer to 5F(1) is ''No'', this firm is not in the investment advisory business. It might give investment advice and sell investment products, but that does not make it an investment adviser that you want to manage your money.

Critically important is "Item 11 Disclosure Information." Every "No" box on this page should be checked, because a "Yes" indicates that the firm has violated some of the laws and regulations governing registered investment advisers.

Where a "Yes" is present, the firm must detail on form ADV the date and nature of the infraction, and how it was settled. A minor infraction, perhaps from some administrative error involving small amounts of money, may be forgiven, but you want to closely scrutinize any "Yes" on this page.&lt;ref name="Kennedy" /&gt;

===FINRA BrokerCheck===
The [http://www.finra.org/index.htm Financial Industry Regulatory Authority], known as FINRA, is the largest non-governmental regulator for all securities firms doing business with the United States public—more than 5,000 firms employing more than 660,000 registered representatives. FINRA was created in 2007, consolidating NASD and NYSE Member Regulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.finra.org/AboutFINRA/| title=About the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority| publisher=FINRA| accessdate=August 31, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FINRA BrokerCheck is a free tool to help investors check the professional background of current and former FINRA-registered securities firms and brokers. It should be the first resource you turn to when choosing whether to do business with a particular broker or brokerage firm. Note that financial advisers can also be registered brokers.
*[https://brokercheck.finra.org/ BrokerCheck]
Enable browser cookies. At the report summary, select "View Full PDF Report" (upper right corner) to get the full details. If applicable, the FINRA report will show any complaints filed against the adviser.

==Investment advisory fees==
Some advisers may not charge for managing money market funds. If the exclude money market funds in the total portfolio value, you may be paying a different fee than you expect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Forum link| title=Wiki - Investment adviser - Advisory fees may not include money market funds| t=393371| author=LadyGeek| date=December 27, 2022}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Please check your adviser's service agreement for this exclusion.

=== Tax deductions ===
Before 2018, you could deduct fees paid to investment advisers for portfolio management ("investment counsel and advice") on your taxes, if the fees exceeded 2% of your adjusted gross income (AGI).&lt;ref group="note"&gt;You used to categorize investment advisory fees, sometimes known as "wrap fees", as a miscellaneous itemized deduction. Miscellaneous itemized deductions have been removed from the tax code. See: [[Outline of tax law changes]].&lt;/ref&gt;

After 2018, you can no longer deduct advisory fees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.schwab.com/learn/story/investment-expenses-whats-tax-deductible| title=Investment Expenses: What's Tax Deductible?| publisher=Charles Schwab| date=December 6, 2022| accessdate=August 31, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text bytes="14150" sha1="f6nwviz9sxqavu6tplwpp33zy8d7x39" xml:space="preserve">An '''{{PAGENAME}} (IPS)''' is a statement that defines your general investment goals and objectives. It describes the strategies that you will use to meet these objectives, and contains specific information on subjects such as [[asset allocation]], [[risk]] tolerance, and liquidity requirements.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;For an interactive course on creating an investment policy statement, see: {{cite web| url=https://classroom.morningstar.com/classroom/investing/collection/portfolios/level/100/course/MORN-C870425758?page=1| title=Creating Your Investment Policy Statement| publisher=Morningstar's Investing Classroom| accessdate=June 5, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, you could consider using a simpler ''investing plan'' (see [[#Investing plan |below]]):
*If you find creating a full Investment Policy Statement too complex
*If your investment objectives do not justify the effort needed to create an Investment Policy Statement

== Benefits of using an IPS ==
Every investor could potentially benefit from having an investment policy statement. It provides the foundation for all your future investment decisions. It serves as a guidepost, identifies goals and creates a systematic review process. The IPS aims to keep you focused on your objectives during short-term swings in the market, and gives you a baseline from which to monitor investment performance of your overall portfolio, as well as the performance of individual fund managers.

If you are using some sort of financial advisor, an IPS outlines the ground rules of the relationship between you and that advisor. And you can use the IPS as a reference to see whether or not your portfolio is achieving your stated goals and objectives. You can also use your IPS to evaluate and review any proposed changes to your investments against your overall objectives.

A properly constructed Investment Policy Statement supports following a well-conceived, long-term investment discipline, rather than one that is based on false overconfidence or panic in reaction to short-term market fluctuations.

== Drawbacks of not using an IPS ==
Someone without a written policy often bases decisions on day-to-day events, which regularly leads to chasing short-term performance that may hinder them in reaching long-term goals. Having a policy encourages you to maintain focus on the long-term nature of investing, especially during turbulent or exuberant times.

== Basic sections of an IPS ==
=== Financial account information ===
This area includes:
* Where are your financial assets located?
* How much is in tax-advantaged accounts ([[IRA]], [[Roth IRA]], [[401(k)]], etc) versus taxable accounts?
* How much will you be contributing to these accounts?

=== Investment objectives, time horizon, and risk tolerance ===
Here you list the following:
* Your short-term financial goals and liquidity needs
* Your long-term financial goals and retirement
** Your time-frame for funding these goals
** The length of time for which you will need these assets
** Amount of assets required

=== Asset classes to use and those to avoid ===
For example:
* [[Asset class]]es you decide that you must include in your overall investment portfolio
** U.S. Stocks
** International Stocks
** U.S. Bonds
* Asset classes you would rather avoid due to excessive risk, high expenses, or large tax liabilities, and so on. For example:
** Hedge funds
** Actively-managed funds with high taxable turnover or distributions
** Consider under-weighting tech sector due to my employment there

=== Asset allocation targets and rebalancing ranges ===
This area lists the following:
* Your target allocation between [[stock]]s and [[bond]]s
* Your target allocation for international investments
* Any time-frame for altering these allocations
* The minimum and maximum deviations from these targets that will trigger portfolio [[rebalancing]]

=== Monitoring and control procedures ===
Here you list:
* Your frequency of monitoring
* Your benchmark for comparison of portfolio returns
* The acceptable deviation from benchmark (amount and time)
* Any concrete procedures for future changes to IPS, for example:
** Financial reasons for changing IPS
** Lifestyle reasons for changing IPS
** Any reasons ''not'' to change IPS (for example, short-term market performance)

|- 
! style="text-align:left;" | Investment objectives:
|These are my main objectives for my investment program. I have developed them after a review of my financial resources, financial goals, asset allocation, risk tolerance and time horizon.
* Objective 1: To retire at the age of 57
* Objective 2: To have an annual income from my investments of at least $45,000 after taxes and in today’s dollars (inflation assumed to be 3.0 percent yearly)
* Objective 3: To leave a meaningful inheritance for my children
* Objective 4: To minimize potential tax liabilities
* Objective 5: To monitor portfolio allocation against holding limits, to benchmark returns against expectations, and to consider revisions to portfolio as personal situation may dictate
|-
! style="text-align:left;" | Risk tolerance:
|My ability to tolerate the uncertainties, complexities and volatility inherent in the investment markets has been considered in the development of this investment program. The main factors that have influenced my risk tolerance and asset allocation are: age, present financial condition, specific financial goals, discretionary income and its variability, past investment experience.
|-
! style="text-align:left;" | Holding limits:
|My portfolio was developed subject to certain holding limitations. These are limitations on the minimum and maximum percentage investment in each asset class:
* Large Cap U.S. Equities (15-30 percent)
* Mid Cap U.S. Equities (10-25 percent) 
* Small Cap U.S. Equities (5-15 percent)
* Foreign Equities (5-15 percent)
* REITs (0-15 percent)
* Inter-Term Govt Bonds (10-25 percent)
* Corporate Bonds (0-10 percent)
* Cash and Cash Equivalents (5-20 percent)
|-
! style="text-align:left;" | Target allocation:
|Based on my financial resources, financial goals, time horizon, tax status, holding limitations, risk tolerance and [[Historical and Expected Returns| expected investment performance]] a recommended portfolio was determined. The portfolio balances risk and reward and attempts to achieve the stated objectives of the investment program. The initial asset allocation is:
* Large Cap U.S. Equities (25 percent)
* Mid Cap U.S. Equities (10 percent)
* Small Cap U.S. Equities (5 percent)
* Foreign Equities (15 percent)
* REITs (10 percent)
* Inter-Term Govt Bonds (25 percent)
* Corporate Bonds (5 percent)
* Cash Equivalents (5 percent)
|-
! style="text-align:left;" | Selection criteria:
|Investment portfolios used to implement the investment program shall be subject to specified selection criteria and shall be monitored for adherence to my investment policy guidelines, major changes in the portfolios and comparative performance with similar investments. The [[Expense ratios |expense ratio]] and overall cost of funds shall be a major point in the selection criteria. To minimize style drift, index funds are preferred, if available, for all asset class.
|-
! style="text-align:left;" | Review process:
|My investment performance will be monitored and reported on a quarterly basis and will be compared against the appropriate benchmarks. The investment program will be reviewed at least annually to make sure that it continues to achieve his stated objectives. Since this investment program is long-term in nature, the periodic adjustments made to his investment program should be small.
|-
! style="text-align:left;" | Rebalancing:
|The percentage weighting to each asset class within the investment portfolio will vary. The percentage weighting within each asset class will be allowed to vary within a reasonable range of plus or minus an absolute 5 percent or 25 percent of the original allocation amount; whichever is triggered first. To minimize taxable events when rebalancing is required, dividends and net cash inflows will be used to meet the strategic asset allocation targets. If cash flow is not sufficient to meet the target allocation for an asset class, I will decide whether to effect transactions in order to rebalance the asset allocation.

|-
! style="text-align:left;" | Asset allocation:
|Maintain overall 60% stock + 40% fixed-income allocation until home purchase to accommodate both short-term and long-term requirements.

|-
! style="text-align:left;" | Funds and accounts:
|Use low cost mutual funds - index funds preferably - which do not overlap and provide maximum diversification across asset classes. Try to assume only market risk as far as possible. Try to shelter tax-inefficient funds in tax-advantaged accounts to reduce tax drag.

* VMMXX - Money Market fund (6 months' expenses) - Taxable account 
|-
! style="text-align:left;" | Other considerations:
|Automate future contributions wherever possible. Rebalance yearly. No market timing. Exact sub-allocations are not as important as maintaining the overall 60/40 stock/fixed allocation - no need to make things complex in order to meet sub-allocation targets.

==Investing plan==
In some cases, a ''formal'' investing policy statement may seem too complicated or inconvenient. In that case, you could develop an informal ''investing plan'' (also referred to as an ''investment plan'') instead. Whether it is called a policy or a plan, the idea is that you have a clear understanding of managing your investment goals and objectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Forum link| t=69802| title=EmergDoc's Investing Plan Thread}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bogleheads forum often gets questions such as "I have $50K saved up and I need to know which funds to put it in!". Setting up an investing plan will help answer these questions.

An investing plan can be as easy as following these simple steps:
*''Step 1'' - Formulate your goals. Be as specific as possible, realizing that you will make changes as the years go by.
*''Step 2'' - Set up a plan for each goal. The plan consists of identifying what type of account you will use to save the money, choosing the amount you will put toward the goal each year, working out an asset allocation likely to reach the goal with the minimum risk necessary, and identifying a plan B for the goal in case the returns you are planning on do not materialize.
*''Step 3'' - Select the best (usually lowest cost) investments to fulfill your desired asset allocation. Using all or mostly index funds further simplifies the process.

Some typical goals that can benefit from an investing plan:
*I want $40,000 for home downpayment by June 30, 2030
*I want to have enough money to pay the tuition at my alma mater in 13 years when my 5 year old turns 18
*I want to have $2&amp;nbsp;million saved for retirement by Jan 1 2050

For a detailed discussion on how to achieve those goals, see {{Forum link| t=69802| title=EmergDoc's Investing Plan Thread}}.

A '''broker''' (also known as a stockbroker) is a regulated professional individual, usually associated with a brokerage firm or broker-dealer, who buys and sells [[exchange-traded fund]]s (ETFs), [[stock]]s and other securities for both retail and institutional clients, through a stock exchange or over the counter, in return for a fee or commission. Stockbrokers are known by numerous professional designations, depending on the license they hold, the type of securities they sell, or the services they provide. 

==Licensing requirements==
In the United States, a stockbroker must pass both the Series 7&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sec.gov/answers/series7.htm SEC.gov | Series 7 Examination], viewed February 28, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; and either the Series 63&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finra.org/industry/series63 Series 63 - Uniform Securities Agent State Law Examination | FINRA.org], viewed February 28, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; or the Series 66&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finra.org/industry/series66 Series 66 - Uniform Combined State Law Examination | FINRA.org], viewed February 28, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; exams in order to be properly licensed.

==Broker types==
In the United States two types of brokerage companies predominate: full service brokerages and discount brokerages. The main differences between these financial institutions are the levels of service offered, and the cost of services. Both brokerages offer cash accounts and [[Margin|margin accounts]].

===Full service broker===

A full service broker provides clients an all-inclusive selection of services such as advice on security selection and financial planning.&lt;ref&gt;Full service broker:[http://people.duke.edu/~charvey/Classes/wpg/bfglosf.htm Financial Glossary]. 2011. Campbell R. Harvey, Retrieved  10 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt; A full service broker establishes a one on one relationship with the client and according to what is determined [[Investment advisor#Suitability|suitable]] for the client's needs and risk profile,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sec.gov/answers/suitability.htm Suitability], SEC. Retrieved 11 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt; offers advice on the purchase of securities.

Full service brokers normally receive commissions for security transactions, and since recommendations employ the investment firm's research reports, the commissions on stock sales are higher than those charged by discount brokerages. Commissioned sales compensation introduces a potential conflict of interest in that the broker may sell products for the commission income rather than lower cost products that may be more in line with the investor's best interest. Full service brokers primarily sell load mutual funds [[Mutual funds and fees#Sales fees|charging front-end or redemption sales loads]], in combination with [[Mutual funds and fees#12b-1 fees| 12b-1 marketing fees]]. Other common products include commission-fee [[unit investment trusts]]; and such instruments as illiquid private [[real estate investment trust]]s (REITs). 

If the full service broker has passed the requisite series 6 exams, the broker may also sell commissioned insurance based products such as [[variable annuity|variable annuities]] and [[Equity-indexed annuity|equity-indexed annuities]].

A client may open two types of brokerage accounts, distinguished by the amount of authority granted the broker.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sec.gov/answers/openaccount.htm Accounts – Opening A Brokerage Account], SEC, Retrieved 10 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Advisory account''': A brokerage account in which a broker can only make limited investment decisions without consulting the investor. Such decisions must be made in accordance with the customer's stated investment goals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://financial-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/advisory+account Definition], Farlex Financial Dictionary, Retrieved 10 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Discretionary account''': A discretionary account is an account that allows a broker to buy and sell securities without the client's consent. The client must sign a discretionary disclosure with the broker as documentation of the clients consent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/discretionaryaccount.asp#ixzz42YET2srm Definition], Investopedia, Retrieved 10 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

====Wrap accounts====
Full service brokerages offer an alternate pricing model through various wrap programs. Instead of charging sales commissions, the brokerage charges a set fee, known as a wrap fee. A wrap fee is a comprehensive charge levied by an investment manager or investment advisor to a client for providing a bundle of services, such as investment advice, investment research and brokerage services.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wrap-fee.asp#ixzz42gNRMl2f Wrap Fee Definition], Investopedia, Retrieved 12 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt; A wrap account might hold individual stocks or exchange traded funds. A mutual fund wrap account holds mutual funds. The wrap fee most often ranges from 0.50% to 2.00% of assets under management.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mutual-fund-wrap.asp Mutual fund wrap account], Investopedia, Retrieved 12 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Keep in mind that the wrap fee is a separate fee and that the investor is also bearing the underlying [[expense ratio]] for the mutual fund or exchange-traded fund investments.

===Discount broker===
{{See also|Charles Schwab|E*TRADE|Interactive Brokers|Scottrade|TD Ameritrade}}

A discount broker is a brokerage house featuring relatively low commission rates in comparison to a full-service broker.&lt;ref&gt;Discount broker:[http://people.duke.edu/~charvey/Classes/wpg/bfglosf.htm Financial Glossary]. 2011. Campbell R. Harvey, Reviewed 10 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt; The first U.S. discount brokerage firms were established soon after May 1, 1975, when brokerages changed from a fixed commission for securities transactions to a negotiated one.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mayday.asp May Day Definition], Retrieved 12 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The expansion of the internet between 1990 - 2000 triggered the development of on-line trading, so that many discount brokers are predominately on-line brokers. 

Discount brokerage eliminates the costs of personalized advice as do-it-yourself investors directly purchase stocks, mutual funds, or exchange-traded funds. For the index fund investor, most discount brokers offer no-trade fee index funds, a specified number of commission-free trades, or a select list of no-commission fee exchange-traded funds.

==Broker malfeasance==

Does Finance Benefit Society?], prepared remarks in his 2015 American Finance Association presidential address&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afajof.org/details/video/7693561/2015-Presidential-Address.html American Finance Association presidential address], Retrieved 13 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt;}} 

Research by Egan, Matvos, and Seru (2016) indicates that broker misconduct is a significant risk facing investors. More than 12% of financial advisers have a disclosure on their record, and approximately 7% have been disciplined for misconduct and/or fraud.  Prior offenders are five times as likely to engage in new misconduct as the average financial adviser. Firms discipline misconduct: approximately half of financial advisers lose their job after misconduct. The labor market partially undoes firm-level discipline: of these advisers, 44% are reemployed in the financial services industry within a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Egan|first1=Mark|last2=Matvos|first2=Gregor|last3=Seru|first3=Amit|date=March 1, 2016| title=The Market for Financial Adviser Misconduct|url=http://ssrn.com/abstract=2739170|publisher=SSRN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) provides [[Investment adviser#FINRA BrokerCheck|FINRA BrokerCheck]], a free tool to help investors check the professional background of current and former FINRA-registered securities firms and brokers.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;FINRA’s BrokerCheck Program provides the following information on brokerage firms:
* A summary report that provides an overview of the firm
* A profile of the firm’s ownership
* A firm history, including any mergers, acquisitions or name changes
* A description of the firm’s operations, listing its active licenses and registrations, the types of businesses it conducts and other details
* Arbitration awards and any regulatory or disciplinary events on the firm’s records
BrokerCheck provides the following information on individual brokers:
* A summary report that provides an overview of the broker and their credentials
* A listing of the broker’s qualifications, including current registrations or licenses and industry exams that the broker has passed
* Previous employment data for the past 10 years, both in and outside the securities industry, as reported by the broker
* Any customer disputes or regulatory and disciplinary events on the broker’s record.&lt;/ref&gt; It should be the first resource investors turn to when choosing whether to do business with a particular broker or brokerage firm. Note that financial advisers can also be registered brokers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finra.org/Investors/ToolsCalculators/BrokerCheck/index.htm FINRA BrokerCheck]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text bytes="9042" sha1="72wnkzelhgsukakjeiwggu66opidfvl" xml:space="preserve">The '''Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC)''' protects against the loss of cash and securities – such as [[Stock basics|stocks]], [[Bond basics |bonds]], and [[Mutual fund|mutual funds]] – held by a customer at a financially-troubled SIPC-member brokerage firm.&lt;ref name="SIPC"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.sipc.org/for-investors/what-sipc-protects| title=SIPC - What SIPC Protects| publisher=SIPC| accessdate=September 11, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The limit of SIPC protection is $500,000, which includes a $250,000 limit for cash. Most customers of failed brokerage firms when assets are missing from customer accounts are protected.&lt;ref name="SIPC" /&gt;

It is important to recognize that SIPC protection is not the same as protection for your cash at a Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insured banking institution because SIPC does not protect the value of any security.&lt;ref name="SIPC" /&gt;

Investments in the stock market are subject to fluctuations in market value. SIPC was not created to protect these risks. That is why SIPC does not bail out investors when the value of their stocks, bonds and other investment falls for any reason. Instead, in a liquidation, SIPC replaces the missing stocks and other securities when it is possible to do so.&lt;ref name="SIPC" /&gt;

To be clear, SIPC protection is only for brokerage firms. If you own a mutual fund or other security that is not part of a brokerage firm, SIPC protection does not apply.

==Holding securities with regards to SIPC protection==
'''Question:''' If you have a fund that is not held in a brokerage account, is it prudent to move it into a brokerage account just to get SIPC protection?

The answer is "no" and explained here.

First, the situation applies to any broker-dealer firm that is a member of the SIPC. A membership list can be found at [http://www.sipc.org/list-of-members SIPC - List of Members]. [[Charles Schwab]], [[Fidelity|Fidelity Institutional]], [[TD Ameritrade]], and Vanguard Marketing Corporation are a few examples of SIPC members.

*Mutual funds and stocks are both examples of financial assets.
*Financial assets, though commonly held in brokerage accounts, can often be held directly with no brokerage involved.
*You can hold a mutual fund directly with a mutual fund company, with no brokerage involved. You can hold stocks directly, with no brokerage involved, although this is very rare nowadays. (This sometimes happens, for example, when employee purchase company stock in an ESOP plan, or when people own policies at a mutual insurance company that demutualizes and receive stock in the insurance company).
*You can hold a mutual fund in a brokerage account. You can hold stocks in a brokerage account.
*No government agency insures the value of stocks. If you own GE stock and it goes down, you lose money. If you own Enron stock, and it becomes worthless due to fraud, you lose money. It does not matter where the stock is held. No government agency insures you against loss, even loss due to fraud. A brokerage customer who bought Enron stock was no better off than an Enron employee who held Enron stock directly, even though the brokerage customer had SIPC protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enron_scandal#Employees_and_shareholders| title=Enron scandal| publisher=Wikipedia| accessdate=September 11, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*No government agency insures mutual funds against loss of value. Theoretically this would be true even in the case of fraud. Mutual fund investors ''are'' protected in many ways by the regulations of the Investment Company Act of 1940. For example, the mutual fund company itself does not hold the assets in the fund; they are held independently by a custodian bank. Nevertheless, there is no kind of government backing or insurance behind a mutual fund. In particular, the SIPC does not provide any protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/100215/mutual-funds-are-not-fdic-insured-here-why.asp| title=Mutual Funds Are Not FDIC-Insured. Here’s Why| publisher=Investopedia| accessdate=September 11, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
*When assets are held in a brokerage, the fact that the brokerage is holding them for you, rather than your holding it yourself, adds a layer of risk. The risk is that the brokerage might mismanage or lose the assets it says it is holding for you, or might even commit fraud. In the Bernard Madoff case, among other things, his firm supplied customers with printed statements saying that the customer's account included holdings in a Fidelity money market fund that did not exist at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/madoff/financial/| title= - The Madoff Affair - Madoff Clients’ Statements | publisher=PBS| accessdate=September 11, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The purpose of SIPC insurance is basically to guarantee the accuracy and integrity of your brokerage statements. If your statement says that you own 100 shares of GE stock, then if it turns out that you do not because of any kind of problem at the brokerage, the SIPC is supposed to make good on your losses.
*If you hold mutual fund shares directly, not within a brokerage account. then your holding is not protected by the SIPC.
*If you hold assets within a brokerage account, then your holding is protected by the SIPC, but you are no safer, because the SIPC merely protects you against the extra risk you incur by trusting a brokerage firm to hold them for you.
*Just as with stock, the SIPC is guaranteeing that the brokerage has really bought shares for you and earmarked them as belonging to you. However, if there were any problem within the mutual fund itself, the SIPC would not be involved in it. The SIPC did not help investors in the Reserve Primary money market fund when it "broke the buck,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.sipc.org/for-investors/investor-faqs| title=SIPC - Investor FAQs| publisher=SIPC| accessdate=September 11, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt; nor did it help investors in the Third Avenue Focused Credit Fund.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-12-10/third-avenue-plans-to-liquidate-focused-credit-fund-after-losses| title=Third Avenue Blocks Redemptions From Credit Fund Amid Losses| publisher=Bloomberg| accessdate=September 11, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-thirdavenue-settlement-idUSKBN1722N4/| title=Third Avenue in $14.25 million settlement over junk bond fund collapse| publisher=Reuters| accessdate=September 11, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Your risk is the same whether mutual fund shares are held within or outside of a mutual fund account. If you hold a mutual fund directly and therefore have no SIPC protection, you do not gain anything by moving them into a brokerage account if the only reason is to obtain SIPC protection.

==Vanguard and SIPC protection==
Vanguard has moved from a system in which mutual fund accounts and brokerage accounts were separate, and many customers did not have brokerage accounts, to one in which all customers have brokerage accounts and hold their Vanguard funds within the brokerage account.

Customers may have received statements such as:
{{blockquote|Vanguard funds not held in a brokerage account are held by The Vanguard Group, Inc., and are not protected by SIPC.}}

As noted previously, funds not part of Vanguard Brokerage Services do not require SIPC protection.

Securities in a Vanguard brokerage account are held in custody by Vanguard Brokerage Services, a division of Vanguard Marketing Corporation. Vanguard Marketing Corporation is a member of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC), which protects securities customers of its members up to $500,000 (including $250,000 for claims for cash).&lt;ref name="VG"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://investor.vanguard.com/accounts-plans/brokerage-accounts| title=What is a Brokerage account and how does it work?| publisher=Vanguard| accessdate=September 11, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vanguard has purchased excess-SIPC coverage protection, which is subject to terms and conditions of the insurance company.&lt;ref name="VG" /&gt;

This purchase of excess-SIPC insurance is for the purpose of insuring customers against losses in customer property above and beyond the distributions they would receive in a liquidation proceeding, including advances from SIPC. In other words, payments under excess-SIPC insurance policies are only determined when all distributions from the liquidation are completed, and a customer has not been satisfied in full.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.sipc.org/for-investors/investor-faqs| title=SIPC - Investor FAQs| publisher=SIPC| accessdate=September 11, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text bytes="19711" sha1="bv7ulfggikhs0qsjir8oq35qkapum61" xml:space="preserve">A '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an online application that provides automated investment advice.

Most robo-advisers collect information about your [[Investment policy statement|financial goals]], investment horizon, income and other assets, and your [[risk tolerance]], by asking you to complete an online questionnaire. Based on your answers, it creates and manages an investment portfolio for you.

Robo-advisers usually aim to offer investment advice at a lower cost than traditional advisers, and in some cases require lower account minimums than traditional [[Investment adviser|investment advisers]]. There is a lot of variation in the services that robo-advisers provide, and their approaches to investing.&lt;ref name="SEC"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.sec.gov/oiea/investor-alerts-bulletins/ib_robo-advisers.html| title=Investor Bulletin: Robo-Advisers| publisher=SEC.gov| date=February 23, 2017| accessdate=August 30, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal interaction==
The amount of human interaction available to you varies from one robo-adviser to another. Some robo-advisers may let you contact an investment professional to discuss your investment needs (this hybrid of both automated and personal advice is sometimes referred to as "bionic" advice). Other robo-advisers might only offer technical support, which will limit you to relying on the information on their websites or other sources you find to answer your questions about investing.&lt;ref name="SEC" /&gt;

As with any adviser, it is very important you take the time to learn about the robo-adviser’s services, including the level of interaction with a person, and find out answers to any questions you may have. Here are a few questions to consider:
* '''Human interaction:''' How much human interaction is important to you?
** Would you like to be able to ask a person questions about your investments, the investment strategy being used, and potential risks?
** Would you like to be able to speak with a person during market events, such as periods of exceptional volatility or downturns?
** Do you prefer being able to talk in person or on a phone, or is electronic communication okay?
* '''[[Bogleheads® financial literacy project| Financial literacy]]:''' What is your level of financial literacy, especially when it comes to investing? Your ability to ask a person questions about investing (for example, about the robo-adviser’s investment strategy) may be limited and you may need to rely almost entirely on the robo-adviser’s online disclosures or other sources of information that you find on your own.
** Are you comfortable using online resources?
* '''Follow-up:''' As with a traditional adviser, you may be interested in how often you will have contact with the robo-adviser. For example, how often does the robo-adviser follow-up with clients to confirm any changes that would affect their investment choices?
** Would you have to contact the robo-adviser with any updates to your financial situation? 

==Creating a recommendation==
A robo-adviser uses information you provide to create a recommendation. As a result, a robo-adviser’s recommendation is limited by the information it requests and receives from you, typically through an online questionnaire. It is important to keep in mind that some robo-advisers may obtain and consider only limited information about you. In addition, as with traditional advisers, in many cases it will be up to you to update this information. Here are a few questions to consider:

* '''Financial goals:''' Would you use the robo-adviser for a specific financial goal (for example, retirement, buying a home, or investing for your children’s education), or to meet your overall financial needs more broadly?
** Does the robo-adviser’s recommendation take into account your purpose in using the robo-adviser?
* '''Financial situation:''' Does the robo-adviser’s recommendation take into account relevant personal financial information, given your goal?
** For example, does the robo-adviser ask for information about high interest credit card debt or student loans you may have?
** Does it take into account your bank and savings accounts?
** Does it take into account your real estate holdings, such as your home, or other investments such as retirement accounts?
** Does it take into account other assets that you have?
* '''Risk tolerance:''' How does the robo-adviser take into account your tolerance for risk? How you respond to the robo-adviser’s questions about risk can affect what portfolio the robo-adviser recommends.
**In addition to the initial makeup of your portfolio, how does your risk tolerance impact how the robo-adviser might rebalance your portfolio (for example, in the event of a market decline)?

==Investing approach==
Different robo-advisers have different approaches to investing, including different investment styles and different products offered. Some have several pre-determined portfolios of investments that they will recommend for you that you may or may not be able to customize. Some robo-advisers focus solely on a limited range of investment products, such as broad-based [[Exchange-traded fund|exchange-traded funds]], or ETFs.&lt;ref name="SEC" /&gt;

Take the time to understand how the robo-adviser develops a portfolio recommendation, and what pieces of information it uses &amp;ndash; or does not use &amp;ndash; to develop a portfolio. Here are a few questions to consider:

* '''Investment products:''' Does the robo-adviser offer a limited range of investment products, such as only ETFs?
** Are the investment products used by the robo-adviser appropriate for your goals?
* '''Portfolio limitations:''' Does the robo-adviser only offer certain limited portfolios within those investment products?
** How many different portfolios could your money possibly be invested in?
** What portfolio does the robo-adviser recommend for you and why?
* '''Account types:''' What type of accounts does the robo-adviser manage? For example, does the robo-adviser manage [[Traditional IRA|individual retirement accounts (IRAs)]]? Taxable accounts? [[401(k)|401(k) accounts]] or [[529 plan|college savings plans]]?
* '''[[Tax loss harvesting]]:''' Does the robo-adviser use tax loss harvesting? Tax loss harvesting means selling investments that have experienced losses in your account, and this may have tax implications. The value of tax loss harvesting can depend on your particular tax situation in a given year. You also have to watch out for [[Wash sale|wash sale]] rules. Make sure you understand the tax implications of any sales, and consider whether you may wish to consult a tax adviser.&lt;ref name="SEC" /&gt; Tax loss harvesting does not apply to tax-deferred accounts, such as an IRA.

==Fees and other costs==
[[Mutual funds: additional costs|Fees and other costs]] can greatly impact your return on investment. One of the main benefits of a robo-adviser is usually lower fees and costs – so it is very important that you understand what you would be charged. A robo-adviser may offer lower-cost investment advice, but if the robo-adviser uses investment products with high costs, your total overall costs could still be high. It is important to understand your total costs.

An adviser's SEC filing will show their fees (see [[#Licensing and registration|below]]).

==Licensing and registration==
Firms that provide advisory services in the U.S. are typically registered as investment advisers with either the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) or one or more state securities authorities. Although the services that they provide are automated, robo-advisers in the U.S. must comply with the securities laws applicable to SEC or state-registered investment advisers. Use the SEC’s [https://adviserinfo.sec.gov/ Investment Adviser Public Disclosure] (IAPD) database to research the background, including registration or license status and disciplinary history, of any individual or firm recommending an investment.

Like traditional investment advisers, robo-advisers are also required to file a Form ADV.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Investment advisers file Form ADV to register with the SEC and/or the states. Some advisers that are exempt from registration (Exempt Reporting Advisers) also complete a portion of the questions in Form ADV for reporting to the SEC and/or the states. All investment advisers must periodically update the information in their filings. Form ADV contains information about an investment adviser and its business operations. Form ADV also contains disclosure about certain disciplinary events involving the adviser and its key personnel. Source: [https://adviserinfo.sec.gov/ Investment Adviser Public Disclosure], from the SEC.&lt;/ref&gt; Robo-advisers may also offer certain information about their advisory business on their websites or in communications with clients. Check the robo-adviser’s website regularly to see if there is any updated information.

==Risks and limitations==
While automated investment tools may offer clear benefits &amp;ndash; including low cost, ease of use, and broad access &amp;ndash; it is important to understand their risks and limitations before using them. Investors should be wary of tools that promise better portfolio performance.&lt;ref name = "ToolTips"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.sec.gov/investment/investor-alerts-and-bulletins/autolistingtools| title=Investor Alert: Automated Investment Tools| publisher=SEC| date=May 8, 2015| accessdate=August 30, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Understand any terms and conditions.''' Review all relevant disclosures for an automated investment tool.
**Understand any terms and conditions, such as the fees and expenses associated with using the tool or with selling or purchasing investments.
**Find out how you can terminate any agreement or relationship, and how long it may take to cash out any investments if you decide to stop using the tool. If anything is unclear or you need additional information, directly contact the automated tool sponsor.
**Ask an automated investment tool sponsor whether it receives any form of compensation for offering, recommending, or selling certain services or investments. 
*'''Consider the tool’s limitations, including any key assumptions.''' Be aware that an automated tool may rely on assumptions that could be incorrect or do not apply to your individual situation. For example, an automated investment tool may be programmed to use economic assumptions that will not react to shifts in the market. If the automated tool assumes that interest rates will remain low but, instead, interest rates rise, the tool’s output will be flawed.
**In addition, an automated investment tool, like other investment programs, may be programmed to consider limited options. For example, an automated investment tool may only consider investments offered by an affiliated firm.
*'''The tool’s output directly depends on what information it seeks from you and what information you provide.''' Which questions the tool asks and how they are framed may limit or influence the information you provide, which in turn directly impacts the output that an automated investment tool generates.
** If any of the questions are unclear or you do not understand why the information is being sought, ask the tool sponsor.
** Be aware that a tool may ask questions that are over-generalized, ambiguous, misleading, or designed to fit you into the tool’s predetermined options. 
** In addition, be very careful when inputting your answers or information. If you make a mistake, the resulting output may not be right for you.
*'''The tool’s output may not be right for your financial needs or goals.''' An automated investment tool may not assess all of your particular circumstances, such as your age, financial situation and needs, investment experience, other holdings, tax situation, willingness to risk losing your investment money for potentially higher investment returns, time horizon for investing, need for cash, and investment goals. Consequently, some tools may suggest investments (including [[asset allocation]] models) that may not be right for you. 
** For example, an automated investment tool may estimate a time horizon for your investments based only on your age, but not take into account that you need some of your investment money back in a few years to buy a new home. In addition, automated tools typically do not take into account that your financial goals may change. 
** If the automated investment tool does not allow you to interact with an actual person, consider that you may lose the value that human judgment and oversight, or more personalized service, may add to the process. 
* '''Safeguard your personal information.''' Be aware that an automated tool sponsor may be collecting your personal information for purposes unrelated to the tool. Understand when and with whom your personal information may be shared. If you have questions that are not answered in the tool’s privacy policy, contact the tool’s sponsor for more information.

*Wealthfront: See this {{Forum post|p=3481224|title=Re: What we know about robo advisors}}.

==Portfolio performance==
A portfolio's performance (return over time) depends on your asset allocation, which is a balance of your [[Asset allocation#Ability, willingness, and need | ability, willingness, and need]] to take risk. The selection process is no different with a robo-adviser portfolio than one based on a "conventional" portfolio from, for example, [[Fidelity]], [[Charles Schwab|Schwab]], or [[Vanguard]].

Robo-adviser portfolios typically hold more funds than a [[Lazy portfolios|lazy portfolio]], but that does not guarantee a better return. There is a comprehensive discussion in this {{Forum post|t=224764|title=Backtesting some robo-advisers asset allocations}}.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;If you are uncomfortable using a robo-adviser, but still wish to manage your own investments, consider a [[Target date funds|target date fund]] instead. These "Set and forget" type funds have been performing "automated" investment management for quite some time - well before the advent of robo-advisers.

      <text bytes="4933" sha1="9uj5o8i9zr9tjbb4nrezh48ztpnlh0m" xml:space="preserve">'''Lump-sum investing''' looks at your options when you receive a [[Managing a windfall|windfall]], such as an inheritance, bonus payment, or sale of a small business. You need to decide whether to invest the cash immediately as a lump sum or adopt a strategy known as [[dollar cost averaging]] (DCA), where you make a series of investments over time. DCA aims to reduce the risk of investing the entire lump sum immediately before a market downturn.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=April 21, 2023 |title=Lump-sum investing versus cost averaging: Which is better? |url=https://investor.vanguard.com/investor-resources-education/news/lump-sum-investing-versus-cost-averaging-which-is-better |access-date=2025-01-16 |website=Vanguard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The short answer is that lump-sum investing is the better choice about two-thirds of the time. DCA can provide certain behavioral advantages that can minimize downside risk and reduce feelings of [[Regret aversion|regret]].  

==Why choose to lump-sum invest==
The main reason to invest all of it as a lump sum is you gain exposure to the markets as soon as possible and historical market trends indicate that [[Stock|stocks]] and [[Bond|bonds]] returns exceed returns on cash investments.

Lump-sum investing will always carry a higher expected return, because it immediately moves your funds from asset classes with lower expected returns to ones with higher expected returns. Note that higher ''expected'' returns do not guarantee that your ''actual'' returns will be higher. 

A Vanguard study concluded that lump-sum investing has historically produced higher returns two thirds of the time when the DCA plan was implemented over 12 months. Lump sum was also more favorable when the analysis used risk-adjusted returns. DCA plans with longer timelines have worse results.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Shtekhman A, Tasopoulos C, Wimmer B (2012) [https://web.archive.org/web/20190404110643/https://personal.vanguard.com/pdf/s315.pdf Dollar-cost averaging just means taking risk later], Vanguard Research Paper, viewed August 31, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

A related Vanguard publication notes that if a DCA plan was implemented over 36 months, lump-sum investing produced higher returns approximately 92% of the time. In addition, over a 12-month period, the maximum downside potential of DCA was higher than the maximum upside potential.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Berkowitz|first=Daniel B.|date=2016|title=Invest now or temporarily hold your cash?|url=https://www.optimizedportfolio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/vanguard-invest-now-or-temporarily-hold-your-cash.pdf|publisher=Vanguard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Why not lump-sum invest==
The main reason to choose not to lump-sum invest is if the investor is primarily concerned with minimizing downside risk and potential feelings of regret (resulting from lump-sum investing immediately before a market downturn), then DCA may be of use.

==Study results==
A variety of studies have covered the lump sum versus cost averaging question and generally they come to the following conclusions.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Finlay|first=Megan|last2=Zorn|first2=Josef|date=February 2023|title=Cost averaging: Invest now or temporarily hold your cash?|url=https://corporate.vanguard.com/content/dam/corp/research/pdf/cost_averaging_invest_now_or_temporarily_hold_your_cash.pdf|website=Vanguard research}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Lauricella|first=Tom|date=November 26, 2019|title=Dollar-cost averaging vs. lump-sum investing|url=https://www.morningstar.ca/ca/news/197440/dollar-cost-averaging-vs-lump-sum-investing.aspx|access-date=2025-01-16|website=Morningstar Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Lump-sum investment strategies beat common cost averaging investment strategies two-thirds of the time, according to historical and simulated  market data.
*Despite the expectation of lower returns, cost averaging might be considered for investors with very high aversion to both risk and [[Loss aversion|losses]] who might be tempted to hold a lump sum entirely in cash.

'''Wellington Management Company''' LLP is a large private investment management company, founded in 1928, and located in Boston.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.wellington.com/en| title=Wellington Homepage| publisher=Wellington Management| accessdate=October 6, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[https://www.wellington.com/en/about-us/learn-more-about-our-firm According to Wellington], as of 2024 the firm manages more than US$1&amp;nbsp;trillion in client assets, and serves more than 875 investment professionals and 3000 clients across more than 60 countries.

==John Bogle's connection with Wellington==
[[John Bogle]] began working for Wellington Management immediately on graduation from Princeton, eventually becoming chairman. In his book ''Character Counts,'' he describes how, in 1966 he completed a merger of Wellington with Thorndike, Doran, Paine and Lewis, "an aggressive equity manager." He says "I relinquished too much of the voting control of Wellington Management Company for my own good." A profile of John Bogle on the American Business Hall of Fame website also alludes to and describes "difficulties dealing with the new Boston partners" leading eventually to "open hostility."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.anbhf.org/laureates/jbogle.html| title=John Bogle| publisher=American National Business Hall of Fame| date=2002| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031017175320/https://www.anbhf.org/laureates/jbogle.html| archive-date=October 17, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This led to John Bogle being fired in the midst of a bear market on January 24, 1974. In his words, "my four partners banded together to fire me as chief executive of Wellington Management Company."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Character Counts: The Creation and Building of the Vanguard Group| author=John Bogle| author-link=John Bogle| isbn=978-0-07-139115-3| publisher=McGraw-Hill| date=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; He founded Vanguard immediately afterwards, creating a "mutualized" governance structure he had originally proposed for Wellington.

==Vanguard funds managed by Wellington==
As of November 2021, Wellington manages 23 funds for Vanguard; nineteen mutual funds and four Vanguard Variable Annuity subaccounts:

Mutual funds
*Vanguard Dividend Growth Fund (VDIGX) 
*Vanguard Emerging Markets Select Stock Fund (VMMSX)
*Vanguard Energy Fund (VGENX)
*Vanguard Equity Income Fund (VEIPX)
*Vanguard Explorer Fund (VEXPX)
*Vanguard Global Capital Cycles Fund (VGPMX)
*Vanguard Global Wellesley Income Fund (VGWIX)
*Vanguard Global Wellington Fund (VGWLX)
*Vanguard GNMA Fund (VFIIX)
*Vanguard Health Care Fund (VGHCX)
*Vanguard High-Yield Corporate Fund (VWEHX)
*Vanguard International Core Stock Fund (VWICX)
*Vanguard International Dividend Growth Fund (VIDGX)

*Vanguard Long-Term Investment-Grade Fund (VWESX)
*Vanguard U.S. Growth Fund (VWUSX)
*Vanguard Wellesley Income Fund (VWINX)
*Vanguard Wellington Fund (VWELX)
*Vanguard Windsor Fund (VWNDX)

Wellington also manages four subaccounts in the Vanguard Variable Annuity, listed here as named by a Vanguard spokesperson:

*Vanguard Variable Insurance Fund - Equity Income Portfolio (annuity version of Equity Income Fund)
*Vanguard Variable Insurance Fund - Growth Portfolio (annuity version of U.S. Growth Fund)
*Vanguard Variable Insurance Fund - High Yield Bond Portfolio (annuity version of High Yield Bond Portfolio)

==November 23, 2010 document request by Federal investigators==
According to a November 23, 2010 Bloomberg article,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2010-11-23/wellington-said-to-get-document-request-from-u-s-in-insider-trading-probe| title=SAC, Wellington, Janus Said to Get Document Requests| publisher=Bloomberg| accessdate=October 6, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wellington is one of several firms that have received document requests in connection with federal investigations of possible insider trading by hedge funds. The article says "No allegation of wrongdoing has been made against... SAC, which manages $12&amp;nbsp;billion, or Janus and Wellington" and that "Wellington said on an internal conference call yesterday that it’s conducting a review of records, and that it didn’t engage in illegal trading."

The article cited Vanguard spokesperson Linda Wolohan as saying that Wellington serves as an adviser to 19 Vanguard funds with about $175 billion in assets, and that "Vanguard has a longstanding relationship with Wellington and remains fully confident in and committed to that relationship and the investment-advisory services provided by the firm on behalf of our client."

On November 29th, in an email in response to a query from [[User:Nisiprius | Nisiprius]], Linda Wolohan stated:&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The complete unedited email can be found in the [[Talk:Wellington Management Company#Linda S. Wolohan's email | discussion tab]].&lt;/ref&gt;
{{blockquote|
Wellington, along with a number of other investment management firms, has received a request for information from government officials with respect to trading activity. To be clear, this reported request for information and documents should not be construed as implying wrongdoing by Wellington. For example, such requests can sometimes be rather broad and sweeping in their nature, directed to industry participants as a way to gather information regarding industry practices and behavior. Whatever turns out to be the case in this instance, you should know that any request for information that may be directed to Wellington would have no direct impact on shareholder assets or the value of Vanguard mutual funds managed by Wellington. The performance of the funds is driven largely by the financial markets and the specific holdings of particular funds.

Vanguard maintains a comprehensive and rigorous oversight process of our external advisors, which are subject to several levels of controls and regulation to protect the interests of Vanguard fund shareholders. As such, Vanguard remains fully confident in Wellington and the investment advisory services provided by the firm to our clients. We will continue to monitor the situation and report to shareholders on any future developments.}}

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' Corporation, originally based in San Francisco, was founded in 1971 by Charles Schwab. The firm began discount brokerage on May 1, 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Schwab_Corporation |title=Charles Schwab Corporation |work=Wikipedia |access-date=August 5, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; An investor can implement the principles advocated in the [[Bogleheads investment philosophy]] by choosing [[Indexing |index]] products available on the Schwab platform.

==Indexing at Schwab==
All ETFs are commission-free at Schwab, enabling use of ETF lineups from [[#Schwab exchange traded funds|Schwab, SSGA, Vanguard and iShares]].

Schwab also manages its own index [[mutual fund]]s and [[Exchange-traded funds|exchange traded funds]] (ETFs). As a broker, Schwab provides access to other firm's mutual funds (usually subject to transaction fees unless the fund is a part of the no-transaction-fee network).

===Schwab index mutual funds===
{{trim|{{Schwab mutual funds}}}}

===Schwab exchange traded funds===

The table below compares ETF offerings from Schwab, SSGA, Vanguard and iShares. All ETFs trade commission-free.

{{Comparison of ETF lineups}}
Schwab offers a growing selection of low cost ETFs (expense ratios range from 0.03% to 0.11%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/insights/insights/insights/insights/node/3781|title= Schwab Market Cap Index ETFs cost comparisons|publisher=Charles Schwab Asset Management|date=June 1, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schwab manages:
*US stock market ETFs (broad; large; growth; value; mid; and small) benchmarked to Dow Jones indices, and a US REIT index (Dow Jones sector index).
*International index ETFs (developed large; developed small; emerging large) benchmarked to FTSE indices.
*Investment-grade and [[Treasury Bonds |treasury bond]] index ETFs (both nominal and [[Treasury Inflation Protected Securities |TIPS]])

International large-cap can be obtained by combining SCHF and SCHE in a 75:25 ratio.&lt;ref name="Xray"&gt;[https://www.morningstar.com/instant-x-ray Morningstar X-Ray], (free) subscription required to access.&lt;/ref&gt; The blended ER is 0.0725%, which is higher than Vanguard's equivalent VEU. 

Developed markets can be obtained by combining SCHF and SCHC in a 90:10 ratio.&lt;ref name="Xray"/&gt; The blended ER is 0.065%, which is higher than Vanguard's VEA and iShares' IDEV.

===Vanguard funds at Schwab===
Vanguard mutual funds can be purchased at Schwab's mutual fund supermarket, One Source, with a transaction fee of $49.95 for on-line trades. Vanguard ETFs are more cost efficient, since they can be purchased commission free. Schwab has also eliminated charges for on-line stock trades.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/01/charles-schwab-is-eliminating-online-commissions-for-trading-in-us-stocks-and-etfs.html |title=Charles Schwab is ending commissions on stock trading and the brokerage shares are tanking |work=CNBC |date=October 1, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schwab may waive transaction fees for a single mutual fund family (such as Vanguard) if an investor's Schwab account contains sufficient assets to qualify.&lt;ref&gt;{{Forum link |p=6157663 |title=Re: Schwab Information Thread with FAQ, Links, Tips and Q&amp;A |date=August 5, 2021 |author=galawdawg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treasury bonds at Schwab==
Schwab charges no commissions for on-line treasury bond purchases for both auction purchases and purchases made on the secondary markets. Treasury securities include treasury bills, treasury notes, treasury bonds, and TIPs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.schwab.com/bonds |title=Bonds and Fixed Income |work=Charles Schwab |access-date=August 5, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fidelity Investments''', commonly referred to as Fidelity, earlier as Fidelity Management &amp; Research (FMR), is a giant Boston-based [[Mutual fund |mutual fund]] company and financial supermarket, and Vanguard's biggest competitor in recent years.&lt;ref group="note"&gt; Vanguard's major competitors in Exchange Traded Funds are BlackRock iShares and State Street.&lt;/ref&gt; Fidelity is sometimes credited with transforming the mutual fund business from a stodgy conservative world of funds managed by committee into the model of active funds managed by stock-picking superstar managers. 

The building blocks of [[Bogleheads Investment Philosophy|Boglehead-style]] investing are low-[[Expense ratios |expense-ratio]] [[Indexing |index]] mutual funds and/or [[Exchange Traded Funds |ETFs]], which are available at Fidelity. Investors have access to index funds with zero minimum requirements and very low ERs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.fidelity.com/mutual-funds/investing-ideas/index-funds| title=No minimum investment mutual funds| publisher=Fidelity| accessdate=September 15, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt; Below are some notes on Boglehead-style investing at Fidelity.

'''John Hancock Variable Insurance Trust''' ("JHVIT"), formerly John Hancock Trust, is an open-end management investment company, commonly known as a [[Mutual fund |mutual fund]]. Shares of JHVIT are not offered directly to the public but are sold only to insurance companies and their separate accounts as the underlying investment medium for variable annuity and variable life insurance contracts (“variable contracts”) which are administered as [[401(k)]] and [[403(b)|403(b)]] retirement plans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.johnhancock.com/content/dam/onejohnhancock/pdfs/annuities-media/annuities-fund-information/JHVIT_Prospectus.pdf |title=John Hancock Variable Insurance Trust Prospectus |accessdate=September 9, 2025 |date=April 29, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This page contains information about funds that are commonly contained in John Hancock retirement plans, with an emphasis on funds that are most suitable to Boglehead-style investors.

==Similar Vanguard funds==
Based on observation of portfolios posted in the '''Investing - Help With Personal Investing''' forum, most John Hancock retirement plans contain one or more [[Indexing|index fund]]s, although some plans contain none. Here are several of the most commonly included index funds that are most useful for Boglehead-style investing, the most similar Vanguard funds, and the ''default'' [[Expense ratios |expense ratios]] of the John Hancock funds.

{{Notice|'''Important Note''': The expense ratios are accurate as of September 2025. These are '''default''' (or lowest best case) expense ratios. Check '''your specific plan''' to confirm the expense ratios and fund lineup for ''your'' distinct plan. It is not unusual for the expense ratios and fund lineup of a particular plan to differ from the default expense ratios.}}

==Tips for Boglehead-style investing==

If you have a John Hancock retirement plan as well as one or more other accounts (such as an IRA), then you may want to select specific John Hancock funds to fill an asset class in your overall [[Asset allocation|asset allocation]]. Below are some suggestions.

=== US equities ===

* If your plan contains only the '''500 Index Trust''', and you can use this fund, then it is recommended you complement it with a suitable small cap index fund to hold the complete Total US Stock Market as described in [[Approximating total stock market | approximating total stock market]].
* If your plan contains both the '''Total Stock Market Index Trust''' and the '''500 Index Trust''' funds, it is often easier and preferable to use the Total Stock Market Index fund. The standard expense ratio for the Total Stock Market fund is only 0.04% higher than the 500 Index Fund, so there is little advantage to holding the 500 Index Fund when you also have the Total Stock Market Index Fund unless the 500 Index Fund fits a specific need in your portfolio. The John Hancock Total Stock Market Index Trust's benchmark is very similar to that of Vanguard's Total Stock Market Index Fund, so the John Hancock fund is a suitable stand-in for the Vanguard fund if that is what you are seeking.
* If your plan does not have the Total Stock Market Index Trust, but it does have the 500 Index Trust and the Mid Cap Index Trust and Small Cap Index Trust, then you can replicate  the total US stock market with those three funds as described in [[Approximating Total Stock Market| approximating total stock market]].

=== International equities ===

* The '''International Equity Index''' is similar to the Vanguard Total International Stock Index, except the John Hancock fund excludes small caps. Therefore, if you must hold this fund in a retirement plan and you want to hold a complementary fund to replicate Vanguard's Total International Stock Market Index fund, then you should add a small-cap international fund like [[Vanguard FTSE All-World ex-US Small-Cap Index Fund]] or similar (see linked page for recommended ratios to hold the two funds).

=== Three-fund portfolio ===
If you want to create a [[Three-fund portfolio|three-fund portfolio]] solely from John Hancock funds, then choose the following three funds in your desired asset allocation ratios:
* Total Stock Market Index Trust (see variations in [[#US equities|US equities]] above)
* Total International Equity Index Trust
* Total Bond Market Trust
If your John Hancock plan is missing the Total Bond Market Trust, then choose the closest substitute. Also, as described above, be aware that the Total International Equity Index Trust does not include small caps, so if your plan has a suitable small cap international fund, you might want to select it (see note above). Assuming your plan uses the default expense ratios, then your blended expense ratio for these holdings will be around 0.57% depending on your exact holdings.

=== Target retirement and lifestyle funds ===
Similar to most mutual fund families, John Hancock includes [[Target date retirement funds|target retirement]] and lifestyle funds. These are [[Fund of funds|funds of funds]] with default expense ratios that are around 1.0% or more depending on the specific plan. Boglehead-style investors might prefer creating a [[Three-fund portfolio| three-fund portfolio]] rather than holding these funds, in order to reduce expenses.

[[File:Vanguardheadquarters.jpg|thumb|left|350px|Vanguard headquarters, Malvern, PA.]]
'''{{PAGENAME}}''' was founded on September 24, 1974 by its first Chairman, [[John Bogle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{forum link| t=147552| title=HAPPY &lt;nowiki&gt;[40th]&lt;/nowiki&gt; BIRTHDAY, VANGUARD}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The firm is based in Malvern, Pennsylvania and offers a wide range of financial products and services, including [[mutual fund]]s, [[exchange-traded fund]]s (ETFs), brokerage services, institutional and personal retirement plan services, college savings programs, charitable endowment services, and professional advisory and trust services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://investor.vanguard.com/advice/trust-services| title=Trust services administers and invests assets | publisher=Vanguard| accessdate=December 17, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The [http://www.ibanknet.com/scripts/callreports/getbank.aspx?ibnid=usa_3045383 Vanguard National Trust Company] was established in 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 1996, the firm established financial service companies in Europe and Asia.

A number of chief executive officers have led Vanguard over its corporate history: [[John Bogle]] (1975 - 1996); [[John J. Brennan|John Brennan]] (1996 - 2008); William McNabb (2008 - 2018); Tim Buckley (2018 - 2024); and Salim Ramji (2024 - present).

===John Bogle era (1975–1996)===
[[File:John Bogle.jpg|thumb|left|John Bogle, circa 1975]]
The Vanguard Group was an outcome of a 1974 corporate struggle at the [[Wellington Management Company]] that resulted in the firing of Wellington's CEO, John Bogle. He appealed to the Wellington Company's mutual funds' board of directors to retain him as the funds' chairman and CEO. The board agreed, and a settlement was reached whereby a new firm, Vanguard, was established (May 1, 1975) to handle administrative and legal services for the funds. At its founding, the firm had eleven funds, 28 employees, 372,648 investor accounts and provided an average expense ratio of 0.66%.&lt;ref name="report"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://institutional.vanguard.com/iam/pdf/WVAR2010.pdf?cbdForceDomain=false| title=2010 Year in Review}}{{dead link}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the next two years the new firm instituted a series of steps that reflected John Bogle's vision of mutual fund management. The new firm was established as a mutual organization with the mutual funds (and by extension, fund shareholders) owning the management company, which would provide services to the funds at cost and reduce conflicts of interest.&lt;ref name="saga"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://boglecenter.net/wp-content/uploads/Vanguard-Saga-of-Heroes-Feb-27-2007.pdf| title=Vanguard: Saga of Heroes| author=John Bogle| author-link=John Bogle| date=February 27, 2007| accessdate=December 17, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The SEC gave final approval of Vanguard's mutual form of business organization in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://boglecenter.net/wp-content/uploads/ncctempleton.pdf| title=The Culture That Gave Rise To The Current Financial Crisis| author=John Bogle| author-link=John Bogle| date=May 13, 2009| accessdate=December 17, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;) In 1976, the firm created the first [[index fund]] available to retail investors, Vanguard Index Trust (now known as Vanguard 500 Index Fund). In 1977, the firm abandoned broker distribution and moved to no-load fund distribution. The year also saw the creation of a series of defined maturity bond funds (short term, intermediate term, and long term).&lt;ref name="saga" /&gt;

Under John Bogle's direction (1975–1996), Vanguard became known for providing both low costs and clear direct communication with fund shareholders. In 1981 Vanguard began managing most of its fixed income funds in-house with the establishment of its Fixed Income Group.&lt;ref name="report" /&gt; The firm continued its development of index funds, bringing the first bond index fund to retail investors in 1986 and the first retail international index funds in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://corporate.vanguard.com/content/corporatesite/us/en/corp/who-we-are/sets-us-apart/index.html| title=What sets us apart from other asset management firms | publisher=Vanguard| accessdate=December 17, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The growth of employer-provided [[401k]] plans led the firm to establish what was to become Vanguard Institutional in 1982. One year later, John Bogle partnered with an outside brokerage firm (Pershing) to create Vanguard Brokerage Services (VBS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/25/business/founder-to-end-his-role-as-chief-at-vanguard.html| title=Founder to End His Role as Chief At Vanguard| publisher=The New York Times| accessdate=December 17, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Bogle continued outside partnerships, this time with insurers (what is now Transamerica Premier Life Insurance Company, and in New York, Transamerica Financial Life Insurance Company) to bring a no-load, no surrender fee, low-cost variable annuity program to the firm in 1991. One of his final innovations was the creation of Vanguard's series of tax-managed funds in 1994. The following year the company added its investment advisory service (staffed with salaried certified financial planners).&lt;ref name="report" /&gt;

In 1996, nearing mandatory retirement age, John Bogle transitioned management of Vanguard to his successor CEO, John Brennan. At the close of Bogle's stewardship, Vanguard had grown to 89 funds and 3,927 employees. The firm was managing 6,681,460 investor accounts at an average 0.31% expense ratio.&lt;ref name="report" /&gt;

Under the direction of John Brennan Vanguard began expanding its operations into international markets and offering additional investment services in an ever evolving financial world. The firm made a commitment to technology, culminating in the establishment of on-line trading in 1998.&lt;ref name="report" /&gt;

International expansion began in 1996 when Vanguard created Vanguard Investments Australia Ltd. to serve Australian investors. Over the next seven years additional international investment companies were created to serve other international domiciled investors. 

In 2007, Vanguard surpassed the $100 billion mark in assets managed outside the US.&lt;ref name="report" /&gt;

In 1997 Vanguard launched its [[Donor advised fund| donor-advised]] charity program, known as the [[Vanguard Charitable Endowment Program]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.vanguardcharitable.org/about-us| title=About Us | publisher=Vanguard Charitable| accessdate=December 17, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; The firm also became a large player in the developing [[529 plans| 529 savings plan]] market.

The advent and growing popularity of the ETF provided a growing competitive threat to Vanguard's index fund base. Vanguard responded to this competitive challenge by first offering a program of lower cost shares for certain qualifying investors (Admiral shares established in 2000). Over time the program was gradually liberalized to include more of the Vanguard shareholder base. After losing a legal case with Standard and Poor's (S&amp;P) concerning the licensing of the S&amp;P 500 index for a proposed ETF share class of the firm's 500 Index fund, Vanguard soon switched index tracking to MSCI indices and launched its own ETFs, originally called VIPERS (subsequently known as Vanguard ETFs). By the close of John Brennan's tenure as CEO, Vanguard was the third largest manager of ETFs.

The firm expanded its offerings of annuities during this period, partnering with insurance companies to offer a deferred fixed annuity and establishing in 2003 a Single Premium Immediate Annuity (SPIA) with both variable and fixed income payout options. The company also opened two series of balanced [[Fund of funds |fund of funds]] designed for retirement investing. The series of [[Vanguard Target Retirement Funds | Target Retirement Funds]] was launched in 2003. The series of Managed Payout funds opened in 2008.

By 2005 Vanguard was managing 130 funds and employing 11,205 people. The firm was managing 21,037,532 shareholder accounts at an average expense ratio of 0.21%.&lt;ref name="report" /&gt;

John Brennan stepped down as Vanguard CEO in 2008, transitioning the firm's direction to William McNabb.

====2009–2012====

The early years of the William McNabb era were marked by evolutionary changes in existing programs. In 2009 Vanguard Brokerage service ended its partnership arrangement with Pershing, as Vanguard decided to run the brokerage internally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.investmentnews.com/industry-news/news/vanguard-to-leave-pershing-and-self-clear-19277| title=Vanguard to leave Pershing and self-clear| publisher=InvestmentNews| date=December 30, 2008|  accessdate=December 17, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; The year also marked the expansion of the company's international fund management operations to [[Investing from the UK| investors in the United Kingdom]] when Vanguard opened Vanguard Investments UK Ltd. International expansion continued when Vanguard announced on June 6, 2011, the opening of Vanguard Investments Canada Inc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.vanguardcanada.ca/ca/documents/Canada_Launch_9.pdf| title=Vanguard Launches Canadian Investment Business| date=June 6, 2011}}{{dead link}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2010 the company cut the cost of investing for its mutual fund and exchange traded fund shareholders by a broad expansion of lower cost Admiral shares ($10,000 minimum investment) in most of the company's index fund offerings, and by VBS granting commission free transactions on Vanguard ETF transactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://personal.vanguard.com/us/insights/article/fund-announcement-10062010| title=Vanguard lowers the cost of investing once again| date=October 6, 2010| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101102221720/https://personal.vanguard.com/us/insights/article/fund-announcement-10062010| archive-date=November 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vanguard also greatly expanded its ETF offerings by launching a suite of new ETFs based on S&amp;P and Russell US stock indices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.indexuniverse.com/publications/journalofindexes/joi-news/8247-vanguard-in-massive-etf-rollout.html| title=Vanguard In Massive ETF Rollout}}{{dead link}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The year also saw Vanguard replace its fixed deferred annuity product with a new service designed to bring to investors cost transparency and institutional pricing for deferred and immediate fixed annuities. The new service, Vanguard Annuity Access, was offered in collaboration with Hueler Investment Services, Inc. through that firm's Income Solutions platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://personal.vanguard.com/us/insights/article/new-way-fixed-annuities-10132010| title=A new way to get fixed annuities through Vanguard| date=October 13, 2010}}{{dead link}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vanguard discontinued this service in 2019.

====2013–2018====

In October 2013, in a bid to lower costs, Vanguard announced a change in index providers for many of its US and international index funds. The firm switched from MSCI benchmarks to [[CRSP equity indexes|CRSP]] and [[:Category:FTSE indexes|FTSE]] indexes.

In 2014, continued strong asset accumulation at Vanguard brought global assets under management to 3.1 trillion dollars. This asset accumulation meant that by year-end Vanguard:
# Became the second largest provider of exchange-traded funds, trailing only BlackRock iShares as a provider.
# Became the largest provider of defined contribution plans in the U.S.
# Became the largest provider of target date retirement funds.&lt;ref name="2014 report"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://institutional.vanguard.com/VGApp/iip/site/institutional/researchcommentary/article/NewsYearInReview2014| title=2014 Year in Review}}{{dead link}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 the firm announced a new investment advisory program, Personal Advisor Services, designed to offer investors professional investment advice from certified financial planners at a 0.30% asset under management fee.&lt;ref name="2014 report"/&gt;

In August 2018 Vanguard introduced commission-free online transactions on approximately 1,800 ETFs trading on the major exchanges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pressroom.vanguard.com/news/Press-Release-Vanguard-Launches-Commission-Free-ETFs-082118.html|title=Vanguard Brings Unrivaled Access To ETFs|date=21 Aug 2018|accessdate=Jan 25, 2019}}{{dead link}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2018 Vanguard lowered the minimum investment requirements for Admiral Shares from $10,000 to $3,000 for 38 index funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pressroom.vanguard.com/news/Press-Release-Vanguard-Lowers-Investment-Minimum-of-Admiral-Shares-111918.html|title=Vanguard Broadens Access To Low-Cost Admiral Shares|date=19 Nov 2018|accessdate=Jan 25, 2019}}{{dead link}}&lt;/ref&gt; At year-end 2018, Vanguard was managing 5.3 trillion dollars of investor assets at an asset weighted expense of 0.12% of assets. The firm employed over 15,000 employees.

===Tim Buckley era (2018–2024)===
[[File:Tim Buckley.jpg|thumb|left|Tim Buckley]]
In 2019 Vanguard retrenched from a number of services offered to investors. On June 19,2019 Vanguard announced plans to transition the client service and account administration for the Vanguard Variable Annuity to Transamerica. Vanguard also discontinued Vanguard Annuity Access, an online platform that enabled individuals to compare income annuities from insurance companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Vanguard to Transition Administration of Variable Annuity Offering to Transamerica|url=https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/vanguard-to-transition-administration-of-variable-annuity-offering-to-transamerica-300871564.html|publisher=Cision PR Newswire|date=June 19, 2019|accessdate=December 17, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 31, 2019 Vanguard discontinued its VanguardAdvantage cash management program. According to Vanguard, less than 2% of eligible clients were using the service, and only half were active users.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Vanguard to end its small cash-management service|url=https://www.investmentnews.com/article/20190304/FREE/190309978/vanguard-to-end-its-small-cash-management-service|date=March 4, 2019|publisher=InvestmentNews| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190421230911/https://www.investmentnews.com/article/20190304/FREE/190309978/vanguard-to-end-its-small-cash-management-service| archive-date=April 21, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Forum post|t=274303 |title=Vanguard is Discontinuing their VanguardAdvantage Accounts |date=February 18, 2019}} &lt;/ref&gt;

==Problematic Vanguard initiatives==

Not all of Vanguard's initiatives have proved successful. Some programs have been shuttered. Some mutual funds have been liquidated or merged out of existence into other mutual funds. While not a recognition of failure, Vanguard has at times radically changed a given fund's fundamental investment mandate so that the fund no longer provides investors with the originally designed sector coverage.

===Program liquidations===

Vanguard's first forays into providing equity real estate investments for investors were the offering of two finite-lived equity REIT stocks, listed originally on the Amex exchange. The Vanguard Real Estate Fund I was offered in 1986&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://google.brand.edgar-online.com/EFX_dll/EDGARpro.dll?FetchFilingHTML1?ID=1032520&amp;SessionID=81WZHv7tKXKDk77| title=Vanguard Real Estate Fund I 1993 K-10 filing}}{{dead link}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Vanguard Real Estate Fund II was offered in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://google.brand.edgar-online.com/EFX_dll/EDGARpro.dll?FetchFilingHtmlSection1?SectionID=1437639-1371-101562&amp;SessionID=ICrHHWfPE6w2r47| title=Vanguard Real Estate Fund II 1995 K-10 filing}}{{dead link}}&lt;/ref&gt; These stocks were designed to invest in commercial real estate properties but liquidate between years seven and twelve. The offerings coincided with a down cycle in the real estate markets (concurrent with the savings and loans scandals and real estate tax reform). Returns on the stocks at liquidation were modest. By 1996, growth in the equity REIT market made it feasible for Vanguard to introduce an Equity REIT index fund.

In the fall of 2001, Vanguard expanded its insurance program by offering the Vanguard® Term Insurance Program to its shareholder base. The program offered 10- or 20-year level-premium term insurance with coverage amounts ranging from $100,000 to $10 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://us.vocuspr.com/newsroom/Query.aspx?SiteName=vanguardnew&amp;Entity=PRAsset&amp;SF_PRAsset_PRAssetID_EQ=87131&amp;XSL=PressRelease&amp;PublishType=Press+Release&amp;Cache=True| title=The Vanguard Group to Offer Low-Cost, Web-Based Term Life Insurance}}{{dead link}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005 Vanguard closed down the program, citing that the plan was not cost effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.investmentnews.com/article/20050110/SUB/501100722| title=Vanguard exits term life business| date=January 10, 2005}}{{dead link}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fund liquidations===

The following table shows Vanguard funds that have been merged or liquidated from existence. Fund mergers or liquidations are the primary actions a mutual fund company takes to eliminate poor performing or small net asset funds. However, some of Vanguard's fund mergers (the Treasury money market fund, and the Institutional bond and developed market funds) were taken to consolidate identical funds into a single fund for management and cost efficiencies. And the liquidation and merger of the Preferred Stock and the Insured Tax Exempt funds was due to significant structural changes (tax rate changes on preferred stocks, and municipal bond insurance firm bankruptcies) in the funds' underlying asset classes.

===Fund mandate changes===

Vanguard occasionally makes mandate changes in a fund's investment objective that radically affects the fund's representation of an asset class. Two such changes in Vanguard sector funds devoted to utilities and gold stocks essentially negated these funds' applicability for defined sector allocation strategies.

In early 2002 shareholders approved a Vanguard proposal to change the mandate of the Vanguard Utilities fund into a Dividend Growth Fund:

{{quotation|As part of the proposals, the fund would no longer invest at least 80% of its assets in common stocks of utility companies. Instead, it would invest in a wide range of companies from various industries. The fund, renamed Vanguard(R) Dividend Growth Fund, would not be permitted to invest more than 25% of its assets in any single industry. Shareholders are also being asked to approve a new investment objective for the fund: to provide above-average income and, secondarily, to provide long-term growth of capital and income.|2002 Annual report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/734383/000093247102000811/vspecializedfunds.txt| title=2002 Seminnual report| date=July 31, 2002| accessdate=December 17, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Curiously, Vanguard was to create a Utilities ETF in 2004. 

In 2004 Vanguard broadened the mandate of the Vanguard Precious Metals fund to include base metal and other materials mining stocks,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/734383/000093247104000488/specializedfundsfinal.txt| title=2004 Annual Report| date=January 31, 2004| accessdate=December 17, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently totally changed the mandate of the fund to become the Global Capital Cycles Fund. The moves essentially ended the fund's applicability as an allocation in gold equity.

In 1999 the firm made its first expansion into international markets by partnering with Robert Fleming Holdings Limited to open operations in Japan. The following year the company acquired Rowe Price-Fleming International and created T. Rowe Price International, Inc. to manage international operations. International expansion continued with cross border funds (T. Rowe Price Funds SICAV, domiciled in Luxembourg, for non-U.S. institutional investors and financial intermediaries in qualifying jurisdictions); in 2004 an expansion into Amsterdam and Sydney Australia (serving Australia and New Zealand); in 2007, an office was opened in Toronto, Canada; in 2008 an office in Zurich, Switzerland (serving institutional investors in Switzerland and Liechtenstein); in 2010 the firm opened an institutional client service office in Dubai.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; 

==Boglehead-style investing at T.Rowe Price==

The building blocks of Boglehead-style investing are low-[[Expense ratios |expense-ratio]] [[Indexing |index]] mutual funds and/or [[Exchange-traded funds |ETFs]]. Vanguard fans would suggest that Vanguard has the best and most complete lineup of such funds, and that the most convenient place to hold Vanguard mutual funds is directly at Vanguard. Thus, the Bogleheads forum and Wiki tends to be Vanguard-oriented. But investing according to the [[Bogleheads investment philosophy]] certainly does not require you to invest at Vanguard or use Vanguard products. Here are some notes on how to do it at T.Rowe Price.

{{Notice|The information below was last revised in December, 2021. Writers have striven for accuracy, but investors should verify information before taking action.}}

==Index funds==
T.Rowe Price is primarily a firm devoted to actively managing investment portfolios. Thus, the firm's balanced [[Fund of funds|fund of fund]] offerings (the Spectrum series of [[Balanced fund|balanced fund]]s, and the [[Target date retirement funds| target retirement]] series of funds) primarily employ active funds as underlying investments. 

The firm offers eight broadly based [[Indexing|index funds]], outlined in the table below. T.Rowe Price investors can create a simple indexed [[Three-fund portfolio|three-fund-portfolio]] using the following three funds:

*  Total Equity Market Index Fund
*  International Equity Index Fund
*  QM US Bond Index Fund

Investors can also create a US total market allocation using the Equity Index 500 Fund and the Extended Equity Market Index Fund.

T. Rowe Price index funds have higher [[Expense ratio|expense ratios]] than index funds available from [[The Vanguard Group| Vanguard]], [[Fidelity]], or from many [[exchange-traded funds]].

The T. Rowe Price International Index Fund is a developed market international index fund. The fund does not include emerging market stocks or Canadian, Korean, or Polish stocks. Small cap international stocks make up only a minimal part of the portfolio.

In addition, index purists should take note that the QM US Bond Index Fund has an active management component. The investment manager has the authority to adjust certain holdings versus the benchmark index, which could result in the fund being marginally underweight or overweight in certain sectors, or result in the portfolio having a duration or interest rate exposure that differs slightly from those of the index.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;  According to the summary prospectus (available at [http://quicktake.morningstar.com/FundNet/SecFiling.aspx?Symbol=PBDIX&amp;Country=USA Morningstar]):
{{Blockquote|The fund’s overall investment strategy is to match or incrementally exceed the performance of the U.S. investment-grade bond market. To achieve this goal, the fund seeks to provide total returns (after all of the fund’s expenses have been deducted) that match or incrementally exceed the total returns of its benchmark index, the Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index.&lt;br&gt;

While the fund’s portfolio is structured to have similar overall characteristics to the fund’s benchmark index, the portfolio manager may adjust certain holdings in relation to their weighting in the index and use other investment strategies in an attempt to generate a modest amount of outperformance over the index. The portfolio manager evaluates specific traits and sectors within the fund’s benchmark index and, within each broad segment of the index (such as corporate bonds, U.S. government securities, and asset- and mortgage-backed securities), selects a set of U.S. dollar-denominated bonds that represents key benchmark traits. The most important of these traits are interest rate sensitivity, credit quality, and sector diversification, although other characteristics may be considered. Based on the portfolio manager’s views as to the relative value or attractiveness of a specific trait or sector, the fund places a slightly greater or lesser emphasis on certain index characteristics than their representation in the index. This could result in the fund being marginally underweight or overweight in certain sectors versus the benchmark index, or having a duration or interest rate exposure that differs slightly from those of the index.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dreyfus''' is an investment management company that is a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of New York Mellon.  The firm has its origins in a brokerage company founded by Jack Dreyfus in 1947. In 1951, Dreyfus created his first mutual fund, the Dreyfus fund, along with the Dreyfus Corporation, the entity which managed the fund. Dreyfus led the company until stepping down in 1965. His successor, Howard Stern, was named CEO in 1971. The company offered its first no-load fund in 1974. In 1994 the Dreyfus Company was sold to Mellon Bank. Stern retired from the firm in 1996.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/the-dreyfus-corporation-history/ History of The Dreyfus Corporation – FundingUniverse], Retrieved June 30 2012. &lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, the SEC sanctioned the company, and portfolio manager Michael L. Schonberg for improper use of warrants and stocks on initial public offerings in the Dreyfus Strategic Growth Fund and the Dreyfus Premier Growth Fund. The firm was sanctioned for not informing investors about these investments and accompanying risks.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/33-7857.htm 33-7857], SEC litigation file. Retrieved June 30, 2012. &lt;/ref&gt; 

Dreyfus offers retail investors both load and no-load mutual funds, closed end funds, annuities and insurance, retirement plans (personal and business), separately managed accounts, and brokerage services.&lt;ref&gt; [https://public.dreyfus.com/products-performance/index.html Products and Performance], Dreyfus.

'''TIAA''', formerly known as '''TIAA-CREF''' (Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association – College Retirement Equities Fund), is a financial services organization that is the main retirement provider for people who work in the academic, research, medical, and cultural fields. TIAA is headquartered in New York city and has $1.2 trillion in assets under management (as of 2022).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.tiaa.org/public/about-tiaa/how-we-help/how-we-invest How we invest], TIAA, viewed January 23, 2024.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''TIAA''' was chartered in 1918 as a stock life insurance company to provide employees of nonprofit education and research institutions with the means to enhance their future financial security.&lt;ref name="struct"&gt;[https://www.tiaa-cref.org/public/about-us/leadership-governance/how-were-structured Organizational Structure], TIAA-CREF, Retrieved 19 April, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''CREF''', a companion nonprofit organization to TIAA, was founded in 1952 to provide retirement annuities based on investment in common stock. In the 1980s, CREF registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940.&lt;ref name="struct" /&gt;

TIAA and CREF each has its own Board of Trustees, whose responsibility is to assure that the organization is managed properly. Above the TIAA and CREF Boards of Trustees are the TIAA and CREF Boards of Overseers. The TIAA Overseers, for example, hold the ownership stock (mentioned just above) of the TIAA corporation.&lt;ref name="struct" /&gt;

In 1952 TIAA-CREF introduced the world’s first [[variable annuity]], now known as the CREF Stock Account.&lt;ref name="struct" /&gt;

In 1996, TIAA-CREF began offering [[mutual fund]]s to the general public.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.tiaa-cref.org/public/assetmanagement/about/why/our-history Our History], TIAA-CREF, Retrieved 19 April, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The firm now offers retirement plans, IRAs, annuities, mutual funds, brokerage services, [[life insurance]], educational savings accounts, and banking.&lt;ref name="struct" /&gt;

In 2016, TIAA-CREF changed its name to '''TIAA''' and revamped its website.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.tiaa.org/public/about-tiaa/news-press/press-releases/pressrelease632.html TIAA-CREF Begins New Chapter as TIAA], February 22, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; This means that the term '''TIAA''' can now mean two things: The entire company, or the New York State-regulated insurance company that operates TIAA Traditional and TIAA Real Estate Account.

==Boglehead-style investing at TIAA==

The building blocks of Boglehead-style investing are low-[[Expense ratios |expense-ratio]] [[Indexing |index]] mutual funds and/or [[exchange-traded funds]] (ETFs). Vanguard fans would suggest that Vanguard has the best and most complete lineup of such funds, and that the most convenient place to hold Vanguard mutual funds is directly at Vanguard. Thus, the Bogleheads forum and Wiki tends to be Vanguard-oriented. But investing according to the [[Bogleheads Investment Philosophy | Boglehead philosophy]] certainly does not require you to invest at Vanguard or use Vanguard products. Here are some notes on how to do it at TIAA.

===Annuities fund offerings===
Some CREF annuities' fund offerings, such as the international funds, are actively managed. Thus an investor's fund selection may result in a ''partially'' indexed portfolio.

The CREF ''Stock'' fund represents a combination of Total US and Total International (excluding US) funds, which is 2/3 of a [[Three-fund portfolio]]. Therefore, a three-fund portfolio can be created using only 2 funds:
*CREF Stock (70% Russell 3000 / 30% MSCI Allworld ex-US) 
*CREF Bond (Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond)

Any Vanguard LifeStrategy Fund allocation, and most Vanguard Target Retirement Funds allocations, can be emulated by an appropriate mixture of the Stock and Bond funds. Just use the appropriate Stock/Bond split.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=1455407#p1455407 The Three Fund Portfolio], forum discussion.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mutual fund (retail) offerings===
Construct a three-fund portfolio using the three available index funds:
*Equity Index (Russell 3000)
*Emerging Markets Stock Index (MSCI Emerging)
*Bond Index Fund (Bloomberg US Aggregate)

==Retirement annuities for 403(b) plans==
TIAA retirement annuities make up a large part of the university and research institution employer provided retirement plan market. TIAA annuity accounts are managed with much lower costs than most variable annuity offerings. Most of the equity based subaccounts (Global Equity, Stock, Growth, and the equity investments in Social Choice) are actively managed using the following three-part strategy:

* '''Active management''': one part of the portfolio is devoted to active individual stock selection;
* '''Enhanced indexing''': one part of the portfolio employs a quantitative modeled stock selection strategy designed to match the risk characteristics of benchmark market sectors;
* '''Pure Index''': one part of the portfolio is managed to match the performance of the benchmark index.

The investment menu provides one stand-alone index portfolio, the Equity Index fund, based on the Russell 3000 index.

The table below lists the subaccounts that make up the TIAA-CREF line-up of investment options.

* '''TIAA Real Estate Account''': a portfolio that holds between 65% - 80% of its assets in directly owned commercial real estate property, with the balance of the fund invested in indirect real estate related investments (no more than a 10% allocation to limited partnerships, [[real estate investment trust]]s (REITs) and commercial [[mortgage-backed securities]] (CMBS), and no more than 25% of the fund in non-real-estate-related publicly traded liquid investments, including U.S. Treasury securities, securities issued by U.S. government agencies or sponsored entities, corporate debt securities, money market instruments and stock of companies that do not primarily own or manage real estate.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.tiaa-cref.org/ucm/groups/content/@ap_ucm_p_tcp_docs/documents/multimedia/tiaa01008860.pdf The Real Estate Account: Frequently Asked Questions], TIAA-CREF. Retrieved 9 June 2012. &lt;/ref&gt;

*'''TIAA Traditional account''': A guaranteed annuity backed by TIAA's claims paying ability, TIAA Traditional guarantees  principal and a minimum interest rate, plus it offers the opportunity for additional amounts above the guaranteed rate. The rate for the additional amounts, when declared by the TIAA Board of Trustees, remains in effect for the "declaration year" that begins each March 1.&lt;ref&gt; [https://www.tiaa.org/public/retire/financial-products/annuities/retirement-plan-annuities/tiaa-traditional-annuity].

===Tier pricing===
CREF Variable Annuities have four price tiers (R1, R2, R3, and R4) for institutional and individual annuities. For institutional plans, the tier level depends on the employer-plan's assets under management (AUM). For individual plans, the pricing depends on the individual plan or annuity product. The table below shows the breakdown of asset levels and plan types for each tier.

===Retirement plan contracts from TIAA===
TIAA offers retirement plans through the following types of contracts:

* '''Retirement Annuities''': A Retirement Annuity (RA) is used primarily for employer-sponsored retirement plans. Depending on the terms of the employer plan, RA plan premiums can be paid by the employer, by the employee, or by both. For employee paid premiums, contributions can be in either pre-tax dollars through salary reduction, or after-tax dollars through payroll deduction.  The employer plan  may contain an option to make contributions in the form of after-tax Roth contributions.  With an RA, the employer plan’s rules determine which investment and income options are available. The employee decides how to invest funds among the available investment options. Employees can change how new premiums are allocated, or move funds from one investment to another. Employees can also transfer accumulations from other investment choices under the employer’s plan to the RA contract.&lt;ref name="Plan Contracts"&gt; [http://www.tiaa-cref.org/public/products-services/retirement/employer-sponsored/option/plan_offerings.html TIAA-CREF - Retirement annuities, group retirement annuities and supplemental retirement annuities], TIAA-CREF. Retrieved 12 June 2012. &lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Group Retirement Annuities''': Group Retirement Annuity (GRA) premiums can only be paid by the employer. Premiums can be from pre-tax or after-tax contributions. An employee can transfer accumulations from other investment choices under the employer’s plan to the GRA contract.&lt;ref name="Plan Contracts"/&gt; 
* '''Supplemental Retirement Annuities''': Many institutions that offer RA contracts also offer supplemental plans, which are known as Supplemental Retirement Annuities (SRAs). SRAs are voluntary tax-deferred annuity (TDA) plans through which the employee contributes money for retirement in addition to the basic retirement plan offered by the employer.&lt;ref name="Plan Contracts"/&gt;
* '''Group Supplemental Retirement Annuities''': The essential difference between a Group Supplemental Retirement Annuity (GSRA) and a SRA contract is that the SRA contract is issued directly to the employee whereas GSRA contracts are issued through an agreement between the employer and TIAA-CREF.&lt;ref name="Plan Contracts"/&gt;
* '''Group Annuity (GA) and Institutionally Owned GSRAs''': These types of plans are used exclusively for employer retirement plans and are issued directly to the employer or the plan’s trustee. The plan's rules govern the transferring and withdrawing of money, the receipt any annuity income or death benefits, and the timing of payments.&lt;ref name="Plan Contracts"/&gt;
* '''Retirement Choice/Retirement Choice Plus Annuities''':These plans work very similarly to GRAs and GSRAs.  The major difference is that, unlike GRAs, they are issued directly to the employer or the plan’s trustee. Among other rights, the employer retains the right to transfer accumulations under these contracts to alternate funding vehicles.&lt;ref name="Plan Contracts"/&gt; Unlike other plan types, the minimum guaranteed interest rate is not constant for life, but can be reset by TIAA at prescribed times.

===TIAA Traditional===
====Vintages====
Deposits to TIAA Traditional are tracked by the date they are made.  Deposits include your original contribution and any additional amounts.  Original contributions and the guaranteed rate are dated as of the date of the original contribution; additional amounts are dated as of the date paid.  Dates are grouped together in vintages, but that grouping may change at the beginning of the next declaration year (March 1).  Vintages can be different for different contracts and can be as short as one month or span multiple years. For example, as of 6/1/12 the RA has 18 vintages, including pre-1992, 1992-1999, 2000-2002, ... , 09/11, 10/11, 12/11, and 1/12-6/12, while the SRA has only 11 vintages.  Since additional amounts are dated as of the date paid, additional amounts derived from an earlier vintage will be spread across all the more recent vintages and each in turn earn the additional amount in effect for that more recent vintage.

Separate vintages also are used in determining any annuity payout.  As of 6/1/12, there are 6 vintages with 4 different interest rates used to determine the annuity payout on those 6 portions of your accumulation.&lt;ref group="note"&gt; The TIAA-CREF website provides access to the record of Traditional account vintages for each contract type:

===Distribution options=== 
403(b) retirement plans have always had "Tax-Sheltered Annuities"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://403bwise.org/education |title=The 403(b) Basics |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |website=403bwise |publisher=403bwise Inc. |access-date=3 December 2023 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as part of their design, and their legal descriptions.

That does not mean that your only options are annuity products, nor does it mean that you are ''required'' to annuitize any of your assets at TIAA. At TIAA, most Participants over 59.5 can choose to annuitize any desired ''fraction'' of their accounts, ''more than once''.

"At retirement, participants have a menu of distribution options available for converting assets into retirement income.
Participants have access to a full menu of annuity options, including fixed and variable, single and joint, ...  various length guaranteed (or certainty) periods, transfer payout, and interest only payments. Participants also
have options to take systematic withdrawals, lump-sum payments, or required minimum distributions. The flexibility of
the distribution menu allows participants to customize their retirement incomes to suit their own consumption and estate
planning needs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Goodman |first1=Benjamin |last2=Richardson |first2=David P. |date=September 2014 |title=TIAA AND CREF: PROGRAM FEATURES AND RECENT EVIDENCE ON PERFORMANCE AND UTILIZATION |url=https://www.tiaa.org/content/dam/tiaa/institute/pdf/full-report/2017-02/rd114a-program-features-recent-evidence.pdf#page=4 |journal=TIAA Research Institute Dialog |issue=114 |pages=4 |access-date=3 December 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TIAA retirement plan participants can opt for the following distribution options when taking income from their accounts:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tiaa-cref.org/public/products-services/retirement/employer-sponsored/option/index.html Retirement Plan Income Options], TIAA-CREF. Retrieved 11 June 2012. &lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Minimum Distribution Requirements''': (available since 1991). The Minimum Distribution option conforms to the IRS minimum distribution requirements and is currently the default option for retirement plan participants.&lt;ref name="Ameriks"&gt; Ameriks, John (December 2002). [http://www.tiaa-crefinstitute.org/institute/research/dialogue/rd_74.html "Recent Trends in the Selection of Retirement Income Streams Among TIAA-CREF Participants"]. TIAA-CREF Institute Research and Dialogue (Issue # 74): 4-6. Retrieved 11 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Lifetime Annuity Payments''': (available since 1918). TIAA-CREF offers both single and joint life income annuities. Joint annuities can be elected that provide the survivor (or, the Second Annuitant, which is not the same thing) with either 100%, two thirds, or one half of the original payout stream. For an additional actuarial cost, individuals can add a guarantee period to the annuity payouts. The choice of a life annuity is irrevocable.&lt;ref name="Ameriks"/&gt; 

:All or part of your TIAA accumulations can be annuitized. The previously offered Graded Payout option for TIAA Traditional, which traded a lower initial amount for subsequent modest increases is no longer available.&lt;ref&gt; [https://www.tiaa.org/public/pdf/TT_FAQ.pdf TIAA Traditional Frequently Asked Questions], TIAA-CREF. Retrieved 22 February 2023. &lt;/ref&gt;. While TIAA Traditional is known as a Fixed Annuity product, the payouts are actually divided into a guaranteed portion and an additional-amounts portion. TIAA has a history of trying to avoid decreases in TIAA Traditional payouts, and of delivering modest increases over time.

:TIAA also provides for a variable immediate annuity, based on a 4% Assumed Interest Rate (AIR) and the performance of the CREF subaccounts. The retiree has the option of selecting monthly or annual income changes. Subject to limitations, TIAA allows retirees to transfer income streams among variable subaccounts; among monthly and annual income changes; from variable accounts to the Traditional account standard payment and/or graded payment annuities. With limitations, retirees can exchange Traditional standard payments to CREF variable payments. They can also exchange a graded payment income stream for a standard payment income stream.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.tiaa-cref.org/ucm/groups/content/@ap_ucm_p_tcp/documents/document/tiaa04016217.pdf Adjusting Your Annuity Income], TIAA-CREF. Retrieved 12 June 2012. &lt;/ref&gt; 
* '''Systematic Withdrawals''': (available since 1996). With a [[systematic withdrawal]], the individual plan owner selects a set dollar or set percentage amount of regular withdrawals from the plan. Lump sum withdrawals are always possible. The systematic withdrawals must meet minimum distribution requirements when applicable (after age 70 &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;). An individual using systematic withdrawals retains the flexibility to convert to other distribution options (minimum distribution or life annuity).&lt;ref name="Ameriks"/&gt;
*'''Interest-Only Payments''': (available since 1989). For TIAA traditional holdings, this income option enables plan holders to receive the interest credited on their TIAA traditional annuity accumulations as income. Principal is retained for a later date, when it can be converted to a minimum distribution option, life annuity, or otherwise withdrawn.&lt;ref name="Ameriks"/&gt;
*'''Transfer Payout Annuities''': For TIAA traditional holdings within a Retirement Annuity, Group Retirement Annuity or Retirement Choice Contract. The primary goal of the TIAA Traditional Annuity is to provide the highest level of interest while guaranteeing the principal balance. In order to uphold these benefits, withdrawals are limited to a portion of the balance each year. For income from a TIAA Traditional balance in a Retirement Annuity or Group Retirement Annuity, an investor can receive 10 annual withdrawals through the Transfer Payout Annuity. Group Retirement Annuities may also offer the choice of annual fixed-period withdrawals between 5 and 30 years. Retirement Choice contracts offer a 7-year withdrawal option.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.tiaa-cref.org/ucm/groups/content/@ap_ucm_p_frm_pub/documents/formdocument/tiaa01008482.pdf TIAA-CREF Transfer Payout Annuity Form], TIAA-CREF. Retrieved 12 June 2012. &lt;/ref&gt;

==After-tax annuities==
Outside of retirement plans, TIAA offers a number of after-tax annuities. The company offers a tax-deferred fixed annuity as well as a no-load variable tax-deferred annuity. The firm also offers both  a fixed income immediate annuity as well as a no-load variable immediate annuity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tiaa-cref.org/public/products-services/tc-after-tax-annuities/identify/compare-annuities/index.html Compare Annuities], TIAA-CREF.

==Mutual funds==
TIAA provides mutual fund investment portfolios for the individual retail market,&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.tiaa-cref.org/public/performance/mutual_funds/index.html TIAA-CREF Mutual Funds-Retail Class], TIAA.

The following table provides a listing of TIAA index funds. The firm offers only three index funds in the retail share class (covering the total US stock and  investment grade bond markets and emerging market stocks). The retail class expense ratios are higher than similar fund offerings from such firms as [[The Vanguard Group| Vanguard]] and [[Fidelity]] and for many [[Exchange-traded funds|exchange traded funds]].

The firm provides a larger menu of  lower cost (retirement shares and premium shares) index fund offerings for employer provided retirement plans. TIAA-CREF institutional shares are used in the firm's management of [[529 plan]]s.

==Boglehead-style investing at Northern==

The building blocks of Boglehead-style investing are low-[[Expense ratios |expense-ratio]] [[Indexing |index]] mutual funds and/or [[Exchange Traded Funds |ETFs]]. Vanguard fans would suggest that Vanguard has the best and most complete lineup of such funds, and that the most convenient place to hold Vanguard mutual funds is directly at Vanguard. Thus, the Bogleheads forum and Wiki tends to be Vanguard-oriented. But investing according to the [[Bogleheads Investment Philosophy | Boglehead philosophy]] certainly does not require you to invest at Vanguard or use Vanguard products. Here are some notes on how to do it at Northern.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' (DFA) is a [[mutual fund]] company located in Austin, Texas. The fund company is of particular interest to [[Bogleheads® investment philosophy|Bogleheads]] because of a corporate culture that is strongly tied to passive investing.

David G. Booth and Rex Sinquefield founded DFA in 1981. The University of Chicago's Booth School of Business was renamed in Booth's honor in 2008 in recognition of a $300 million gift to the school, said to be the largest donation ever made to a business school.

Booth was involved in the creation of the Samsonite Luggage Fund&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://research.chicagobooth.edu/fama-miller/docs/the-origin-of-the-first-index-fund.pdf| title=The Origin of the First Index Fund| author=Kate Ancell| date=2012| publisher=The University of Chicago Booth School of Business| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170721025704/https://research.chicagobooth.edu/fama-miller/docs/the-origin-of-the-first-index-fund.pdf| archive-date=July 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; at Wells Fargo in 1971; this fund "was to hold an equal dollar amount of each of the 1,500 or so stocks listed on the NYSE, which seemed the most appropriate replication of "the market." Some have claimed this to be the "first index fund," a claim which [[John C. Bogle]] refutes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://johncbogle.com/wordpress/2007/03/06/john-bogles-letter-to-wall-street-journal-editor/| title=John Bogle’s Letter to Wall Street Journal Editor| date=March 6, 2007| accessdate=June 18, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in any case Booth was involved in the pioneering days of the passive approach.

DFA is known for the use of academic research to inform investing strategy, and boasts of its formal associations with prominent financial economists, including 2013 Nobelist [[Eugene F. Fama]], [[Kenneth R. French]], Roger G. Ibbotson, and Nobelists Robert C. Merton and Myron S. Scholes.

With approximately $786 billion in assets under management (AUM) as of 2025, DFA is much smaller than [[The Vanguard Group|Vanguard]] or [[Fidelity]]. In 2013, Investment News described it as the 8th largest mutual fund company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.investmentnews.com/article/20131028/FREE/131029899#| title=With $16.7B in new money, a banner year for Dimensional Fund Advisors| date=October 28, 2013| publisher=InvestmentNews LLC| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190118000046/https://www.investmentnews.com/article/20131028/FREE/131029899| archive-date=January 18, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2020, DFA converted several of its mutual funds into ETFs which are now accessible by retail investors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-18/dimensional-etfs-launch-as-quant-plans-to-convert-mutual-funds| title=Dimensional Fund ETFs Launch as Quant Plans to Convert Mutual Funds| date=November 18, 2020| publisher=Bloomberg| accessdate=June 18, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DFA mutual funds are available through advisors.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;DFA funds may be available in some corporate 401k plans. DFA funds are also available to 529 savings plan investors through the [[West Virginia Smart 529 Select Plan]]. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Expense ratios==

DFA's [[expense ratios]] are low by most standards, but higher than those of Vanguard. It is hard to define "corresponding funds." If using Vanguard's Admiral shares on the assumption that most DFA investors probably would qualify for Admiral shares, you might compare DFA U. S. Core Equity 1 Portfolio (DFEOX) with Vanguard Total Stock Market Index (VTSAX), or DFA International Small Company Portfolio (I) (DFISX) with [[Vanguard FTSE All-World ex-US Small-Cap Index Fund|Vanguard FTSE All-World ex-US Small-Cap]] (VFSVX, or VSS). The need to purchase through an advisor adds another layer of fees. 

Some Bogleheads are cost-sensitive do-it-yourself investors, and express distaste for the need to pay an advisor for access. DFA-approved advisors must undergo DFA training. Using advisors as gatekeepers is supposed to ensure that customers will be under the guidance of advisors who understand a disciplined, long-term approach, and insulate DFA from the difficulties and transactional costs of investors flooding in and out of funds based on recent performance.

==Investment strategy==
 
DFA funds are index-like funds, in the sense that they do not use managers' judgement to pick individual stocks, but try to capture the overall characteristics of a well-defined category of assets in a systematic way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.dimensional.com/us-en/our-approach| title=Dimensional Difference| publisher=Dimensional| accessdate=June 18, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they are not [[Indexing|index funds]].

Compare the stated objective of Vanguard Small-Cap Value Index Fund and DFA U.S. Small Cap Value Portfolio. The index fund's objective is "to track the performance of a benchmark index that measures the investment return of small-capitalization value stocks." The specific index is named elsewhere in the Prospectus. In contrast, the DFA fund states with vagueness, "The investment objective of the U.S. Small Cap Value Portfolio is to achieve long-term capital appreciation," which it achieves by "using a [[Market Capitalization|market capitalization]] weighted approach, purchases a broad and diverse group of the readily marketable common stocks of U.S. small cap companies that the Advisor determines to be value stocks." 

DFA funds do not slavishly follow an index, but use various adjustments and modifications, and use a transactional technique called "patient trading."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.dimensional.com/us-en/process/trading.html| title=Process: Trading| publisher=Dimensional}}{{broken link}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bogleheads sometimes debate whether DFA funds are truly passive or whether their approach actually represents a mild form of active management. It is, in any case, worlds away from the stock-picking star managers of truly active funds like a Fidelity Contrafund or a Fairholme Fund.

IBKR platform offers access to 135 market centers in 33 countries and 23 different currencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/index.php?f=1323| title=Global Access| publisher=Interactive Brokers LLC| accessdate=July 9, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of March 2021, 38% of IBKR client accounts were from Asia, 36% from the Americas and 26% from Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=1Q21 IBKR Presentation|url=https://investors.interactivebrokers.com/download/investors/1Q21_IBKR_Presentation.pdf| page=10| date=July 7, 2021| accessdate=July 7, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Interactive Brokers Group has a market capitalization of $26 billion, as of July 2021.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Interactive Brokers LLC Due Diligence Memo| url=https://www.interactivebrokers.com/download/due-diligence-info.pdf| page=1| date=July 17, 2015| publisher=Interactive Brokers LLC| accessdate=December 29, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cost structure == 

Interactive Brokers offers two primary pricing options: IBKR Pro and IBKR Lite. IBKR Pro is available to all clients while IBKR Lite is limited to US-based clients. 

* IBKR Pro - This is the firm's standard pricing plan.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Effective July 1, 2021, Interactive Brokers removed its $10/month inactivity fee for accounts below $100,000. See: {{Forum post| t=353091| title=Interactive Brokers gets rid of monthly fees &amp; minimal account values |date=July 8, 2021 |author=assyadh}}, and {{Forum post| p=6108538| title=Re: Interactive Brokers (Best Kept Secret)| date=July 8, 2021| author=assyadh}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although this plan charges a small per-share commission for transactions, it offers better interest rates on cash and margin loans and potentially better trade execution quality.
* IBKR Lite - This is the firm's commission-free offering for US stocks and ETFs. Orders under this plan are typically sent to market makers for executions instead of public exchanges. 

Clients can switch back and forth between both plans. For more information on these pricing plans, see: [https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/index.php?f=45500 Which Plan is Best for You] from Interactive Brokers.

==Interfaces for trading==

Interactive Brokers offers multiple trading platforms including: 
* Mobile - Android or iOS

'''Merrill Edge''' is a large online brokerage platform that was founded in 2010, two years after Bank of America acquired Merrill Lynch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.merrilledge.com/about| title=About Merrill Edge| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180126154919/https://www.merrilledge.com/about| archive-date=January 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the main reasons Bogleheads use Merrill Edge is to qualify for Bank of America's Preferred Rewards program,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://promotions.bankofamerica.com/preferredrewards/en| title=Bank of America Preferred Rewards - Banking Rewards Program| publisher=Bank of America| accessdate=February 29, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt; which offers higher credit card cash back rewards.

==Boglehead-style investing at Merrill Edge==

The building blocks of Boglehead-style investing are low-[[Expense ratios |expense-ratio]] [[Indexing |index]] [[Mutual fund|mutual funds]] or [[exchange-traded funds]] (ETFs). [[Vanguard Group|Vanguard]] supporters usually suggest that Vanguard has the best and most complete lineup of such funds, and that the most convenient place to hold Vanguard mutual funds is directly at Vanguard. This means that the Bogleheads forum and Wiki tend to be oriented towards Vanguard products.

However, you do not need to invest at Vanguard, or use Vanguard products, to follow the [[Bogleheads Investment Philosophy | Boglehead philosophy]]. Here are some notes on how to do this at Merrill Edge.

The information below is up-to-date as of February 28, 2024. Authors have aimed for accuracy, but please verify information before taking action.

{{Blockquote|
Generally, an "investment company" is a company (corporation, business trust, partnership, or limited liability company) that issues securities and is primarily engaged in the business of investing in securities.

An investment company invests the money it receives from investors on a collective basis, and each investor shares in the profits and losses in proportion to the investor's interest in the investment company. The performance of the investment company will be based on (but it won't be identical to) the performance of the securities and other assets that the investment company owns.

The U.S. federal securities laws categorize investment companies into three basic types:

* [[Mutual fund|Mutual funds]] (legally known as open-end companies);
* [[Closed-end funds]] (legally known as closed-end companies);
* UITs (legally known as [[Unit investment trusts|unit investment trusts]]).

Harry Sit (The Finance Buff) has outlined his method to use Fidelity as your primary checking account in his article: [https://thefinancebuff.com/fidelity-cash-management-checking-savings.html 2 Ways to Use Fidelity as a Checking or Savings Account].  

A key differentiator for Fidelity is the ability to use an interest-bearing auto-sweep money market fund to obtain high-yield interest on all deposited money vs a separate checking/HYSA where the checking account garners little to no interest.  Fidelity ranked highly in Chris Hutchin's All the Hacks podcast of best bank accounts with high interest rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.chrishutchins.com/best-bank-accounts-high-interest/|title=Best Bank Accounts with High Interest Rates|author=Chris Hutchins|website=All the Hacks|access-date=2025-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disadvantages, issues, and concerns==
* Fidelity's fraud algorithm reportedly is quite aggressive and will restrict an account or money movement for 'irregular' behavior.  Examples from the community include multiple checks deposited with similar amounts in quick succession (concern for check fraud) or using accounts while abroad. The main reasons for these restrictions per Fidelity include 
** fraud or financial exploitation concerns
** missing documentation
** possible violations of industry regulations or federal/state law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Forum link|t=439500|title=[Split from "Fidelity as a one stop shop" thread - locked or restricted Fidelity account issues]|date= September 9, 2024|author=ez_mode}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=[MEGATHREAD] Addressing your questions about account and money movement restrictions.|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/fidelityinvestments/comments/1fj85a8/comment/mgk5vm3/|publisher=Reddit|date=2025-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Theoretical security concerns involve unauthorized access to the CMA account by debit card or checks/ACH, and the risk that the CMA and a linked investment account can be drained of funds. A common suggestion is to have a separate, unlinked investment account to hold the investment portfolio, with no mingling of investment capital and the money used for expenses/banking.
*For those who manually purchase money market funds, it is difficult to get a clean view of deposits and withdrawals like a 'normal' banking account.  Even using filters, it will include the MMF purchases.

*The Fidelity Account® for Businesses does not support Bill Pay.
*Businesses cannot open a Fidelity CMA account. However, the Fidelity account for business can use FZFXX as its core position. This comprises treasury bills and repurchases, and can also be considered a safe, conservative position.

==Advantages, tips, links, and general orientation==
* The default account at Fidelity is a full-featured brokerage account. You can buy mutual funds (Fidelity and non-Fidelity funds), ETFs, individual stocks, bonds, brokered [[CD]]s, and fractional shares along with options and precious metals, all within the same Fidelity account.

===Automating conversion to a non-core money market fund===
This is possible by scheduling purchases for greater than the amount held in your core position.  For example, if you prefer holding FDLXX rather than SPAXX, you can set a monthly purchase of FDLXX greater than what you expect will be in your core position.  Your prior holdings of FDLXX will be auto-liquidated to cover the difference between what is in your core holding and the overage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Forum link|p=7193501 | title = Re: Fidelity as a one stop shop| author = wenchleaf| date = March 28, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If you choose to set up Automatic Investments tools, log in to Fidelity.com and do the following:

# Click "Accounts &amp; Trade," then "Account Features"
# Select "Payments &amp; Transfers," followed by "Automatic Transfers and Investments"
# Choose the appropriate action and follow the steps

Now let's move to auto-liquidation and how it works with Automatic Investments. In the scenario that you presented, the core position needs to have the necessary funds to cover the Automatic Investment process. It would only attempt another one in the next month.

The purpose of auto-liquidation is to cover certain debit balances. It is best practice to sell non-core money markets before expected purchases. However, it is generally possible to utilize a secondary money market mutual fund to cover distributions in addition to your core position. Fidelity will attempt to cover debit balances created through trades, direct debits, checkwriting, etc., by first using funds in your core balance. If the core balance is depleted, the system will turn to any eligible secondary money market fund to cover the transaction. In these cases, the money market fund will automatically be liquidated.}}

===Order of auto-liquidation in CMA and brokerage accounts===

Fidelity will attempt to cover debit balances created, whether through trades, direct debits, check writing, etc., by first using funds in your core balance. If the core balance is depleted, the system will turn to any eligible secondary money market fund to cover the transaction. In these cases, the money market fund will automatically be liquidated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.reddit.com/r/fidelityinvestments/comments/1b3cn96/comment/kss69bm/| title=Money market auto-liquidation rules and margin| publisher=Reddit| accessdate=April 23, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From Fidelity:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.reddit.com/r/fidelityinvestments/comments/112pvrb/autoliquidation_in_cma_accounts/| title=Auto-liquidation in CMA accounts| publisher=Reddit| accessdate=May 4, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quotation|There is an order in which money markets will liquidate. When purchases or debits are made, the debit will be drawn first from the core, then followed by any additional money markets. If the core has insufficient funds alongside additional money market mutual funds in the account, we would draw from the taxable money markets first, then the tax-free money markets. Within each category, we draw from the fund with the highest balance first.}}

Although checks contain the statement:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7522245#p7509436| title=Fidelity as a one stop shop| publisher=Bogleheads Forum| accessdate=December 3, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|Please note that all checks written from this book are drawn from your Fidelity core account. Other holdings in your Fidelity Account will not be automatically redeemed to cover checks that you write. To avoid bouncing your checks, please make sure you have available funds in your core account.}}

the amount the account shows as "Available to Withdraw", and not the amount in the core holding determines how much a check can be written for.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7522245#p7522245| title=Fidelity as a one stop shop| publisher=Bogleheads Forum| accessdate=December 3, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-core money market funds that auto-liquidate===

While there is not a published list of money market funds that are eligible for auto-liquidation, you can determine whether a money market will auto liquidate using the requirements below.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.reddit.com/r/fidelityinvestments/comments/10tqjnp/is_there_a_list_of_money_market_funds_eligible/| title=Is there a list of money market funds eligible for auto-liquidation in Cash Management Account?| website=Reddit| accessdate=March 9, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Fidelity Investments Money Market (FIMM), non-FIMM government, retail prime, and retail municipal funds
*Maintains a stable net asset value
*A liquidity fee has not been imposed

      <text bytes="3975" sha1="ovjt4upllzjbimo9uytb5gzc1lfe541" xml:space="preserve">'''Vanguard's investment philosophy''' is based on four simple principles:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://personal.vanguard.com/us/insights/investingprinciples| title=Vanguard's Principles for Investment Success| publisher=Vanguard| date=2014| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150205132318/https://personal.vanguard.com/us/insights/investingprinciples| archive-date=February 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Define clear goals,
# Invest with balance and diversification,
# Minimize cost, and
# Stay disciplined over the long term.

==Vanguard's investment guidance==

Vanguard explains its investment guidance in separate articles:

; Principle 1 - Create clear, appropriate investment goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://personal.vanguard.com/us/insights/investingtruths/investing-truth-about-time| title=Principle 1: Create clear, appropriate investment goals| publisher=Vanguard| date=2014| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140719192602/https://personal.vanguard.com/us/insights/investingtruths/investing-truth-about-time| archive-date=July 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;: Your investment goals should be measurable and attainable. Success should not depend upon outsize investment returns, or on impractical saving or spending requirements.
; Principle 2 - Develop a suitable asset allocation using broadly diversified funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://personal.vanguard.com/us/insights/investingtruths/investing-truth-about-risk| title=Principle 2: Develop a suitable asset allocation using broadly diversified funds| publisher=Vanguard| date=2014| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140719202332/https://personal.vanguard.com/us/insights/investingtruths/investing-truth-about-risk| archive-date=July 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;: A sound investment strategy starts with an asset allocation suitable for your portfolio's objective. You should build your allocation on reasonable expectations for risk and returns, using diversified investments to avoid exposure to unnecessary risks.
; Principle 3 - Minimize cost. Markets are unpredictable. Costs are forever.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://personal.vanguard.com/us/insights/investingtruths/investing-truth-about-cost| title=Principle 3: Minimize cost| publisher=Vanguard| date=2014| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141231023023/https://personal.vanguard.com/us/insights/investingtruths/investing-truth-about-cost| archive-date=December 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;: The lower your costs, the greater your share of an investment's return. Research suggests that lower-cost investments have tended to outperform higher-cost-alternatives. To hold on to even more of your return, manage for tax efficiency. You cannot control the markets, but you can control losses to costs and taxes.
; Principle 4 - Maintain perspective and long-term discipline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://personal.vanguard.com/us/insights/investingtruths/investing-truth-about-emotion| title=Principle 4: Maintain perspective and long-term discipline| publisher=Vanguard| date=2014| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140719195144/https://personal.vanguard.com/us/insights/investingtruths/investing-truth-about-emotion| archive-date=July 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;: Investing can provoke strong emotions. In the face of market turmoil, you may find yourself making impulsive decisions or, conversely, becoming paralyzed and unable to implement an investment strategy or to rebalance your portfolio. Discipline and perspective are the qualities that can help you remain committed to your long-term investment programs through periods of market uncertainty.

==Investing with Vanguard==

===Why is Vanguard different?===
{{Main| The Vanguard Group}}

Unlike other investment fund companies, Vanguard is owned by, and thus run entirely for the benefit of, its investors. Partly as a result, Vanguard has very low costs.

From Vanguard's [https://corporate.vanguard.com/content/corporatesite/us/en/corp/what-we-offer/index.html What we offer] web page:
{{quotation|Vanguard is mission-driven to ensure that every product and service we offer can contribute to our clients’ investment success.&lt;br&gt;Because our investors are our owners, we can focus on the long term rather than quarterly results. And we can consistently pass along economies of scale and lower the cost of investing, so our owners keep more of their potential returns.}}
 
The [[Mutual Funds and Fees |low costs]] are important because of the power of compounding. Paying 0.2% costs (typical for a Vanguard investor) for 30 years means that you lose 6% of your investment to costs. Paying 1.2% costs (common for many investors) means that you lose 30% to costs.

===Are my investments at Vanguard safe?===
{{Main| Vanguard safety}}

Vanguard (and every other US-regulated mutual fund company) does not hold funds directly. Funds are held by third party custodians. Investors who remain uncomfortable holding all of their assets in Vanguard may hold their funds with alternative custodians.

===What are the benefits of holding large asset balances with Vanguard?===

Vanguard offers extended support for clients who hold larger asset balances in their Vanguard accounts:
*[https://investor.vanguard.com/client-benefits Explore the benefits of investing at Vanguard]
*[https://investor.vanguard.com/wealth-management Wealth management for investors with more than $5&amp;nbsp;million]

===Can I tell if a Vanguard fund is going to have a distribution?===
Vanguard may provide early announcements of quarterly and year end fund distributions on their website:

*[https://advisors.vanguard.com/insights/all All Insights] - Vanguard Advisors

===How can I share access to my Vanguard account with other people?=== 
Visit Vanguard's [https://personal1.vanguard.com/ngf-next-gen-form-webapp/forms Forms and Literature] page. Open the "Allow others access to view or transact on your accounts" pulldown menu, and navigate to "Allow access to your individual/joint account or IRA or establish power of attorney".

===What fees does Vanguard charge,  and how can I avoid them?===
For a full list of Vanguard's investment fees and costs, see:

*[https://investor.vanguard.com/client-benefits/investment-fees Investment fees and costs] - Vanguard.com

==Vanguard Brokerage Services (VBS)==
 
===What are the fees for Vanguard Brokerage Services?===
For details of the charges specific to Vanguard Brokerage Services, see:

*[https://investor.vanguard.com/client-benefits/brokerage-fees-commissions Brokerage services commission and fee schedules] - Vanguard.com

===How do I sell specific shares at Vanguard?===
{{Main| Specific identification of shares#At Vanguard| l1=Specific identification of shares - At Vanguard}}

Vanguard Brokerage Services requires you to choose a preferred cost basis method for each individual security you own in a taxable account. The default choice is FIFO (first-in, first-out). Your options are FIFO, MinTax (most favorable tax rate), or HIFO (highest-in, first-out). AvgCost is also an option for mutual funds. (Note: SpecID used to be an option but Vanguard removed it; see {{Forum link|t=454409|title=&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;Vanguard email about selecting automatic cost basis&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;}} for a discussion.)

You can override the preferred method and use Specific ID on each sale order but you must remember to do so and also select which specific lots to include. Otherwise Vanguard will automatically assign shares to your sale order according to the rules of your preferred method.

If you sell non-covered shares, there will be only one lot listed (even if you purchased multiple lots), and you will have to identify the shares in a secure Email. If you write a letter to Vanguard to make the sale, you also need to identify the shares in your letter.

===Can I buy bonds through Vanguard Brokerage Services? What is the cost?===
Vanguard offers two ways to buy bonds through the platform. New issues are purchased directly from the issuer. Secondary trades are purchased from other people who are selling their bonds. Vanguard Brokerage charges an additional $25 broker-assisted fee for secondary trades placed over the phone:

*[https://investor.vanguard.com/client-benefits/brokerage-fees-commissions Brokerage services commission and fee schedules] - Vanguard.com

===Is there a cash management account?===
Yes, the [https://investor.vanguard.com/accounts-plans/vanguard-cash-plus-account Vanguard Cash Plus Account] offers cash management features in a brokerage account with a bank sweep program using FDIC-insured banks.

Some features include:
*direct deposit
*mobile check deposit
*next day bank transfers
*paypal and venmo compatibility

These are Vanguard's three broad international index funds. Any of the three is a good core international holding, and all are eligible for the [[foreign tax credit]], should have very low capital gains, making them suitable for taxable accounts. You might also add Vanguard Emerging Markets Index Fund if you hold Developed Markets Index (or a non-Vanguard international fund) which has no emerging markets.

With Vanguard currently offering several broad international index funds, some investors may wonder what they should buy in their portfolios. Here is an attempt to address '''frequently asked questions''' about these funds.

== Basic questions ==

=== What broad international index funds does Vanguard have? ===

* [{{vf|0113}} Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund]
* [{{vf|0770}} Vanguard FTSE All-World ex-US Index Fund]

=== Should I buy Total International or FTSE All-World ex-US? ===

Both funds are broadly diversified international index funds, which include both developed and emerging market stocks. The Total International Index fund tracks the [[FTSE Global All Cap ex US Index|FTSE Global All Cap ex-US Index,]] providing access to large cap, mid cap, and small cap international stocks. The FTSE All-World ex-US Index fund, tracks the [[FTSE All World ex US Index|FTSE All World ex-US Index]] which covers large cap and mid cap stocks.

==== FTSE All-World ex-US ====

* Tax efficient. The fund has distributed, on average, 75% [[Qualified dividend | qualified dividends]] since inception . The fund is eligible for the [[foreign tax credit]]. It is very unlikely to distribute capital gains in the event that a country (think South Korea) moves out of emerging markets and joins developed markets.
* The investor share [[Expense ratios |expense ratio]] (0.29%) is higher than that of Total International (0.22%)
* The fund offers admiral shares with an expense ratio of 0.14%. As a general rule, expense ratios decline as fund assets increase.
* Covers large cap and mid cap stocks. Includes Canada.

==== Total International ====

* The fund has distributed, on average, 75% [[Qualified dividend | qualified dividends]] under the qualified dividend tax regime. The fund qualifies for the foreign tax credit.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The Total International fund completed transition from the fund of funds structure (which does not pass along the foreign tax credit) in 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; It is very unlikely to distribute capital gains in the event that a country moves out of emerging markets and joins developed markets. 
* The expense ratio (0.22%) is lower than that of FTSE All-World ex-US (0.29%). 
* Offers admiral shares (expense ratio 0.14%). As a general rule, expense ratios decline as fund assets increase.
* Covers large cap, mid cap and small cap stocks. Includes Canada.

=== Should I exchange FTSE All-World ex-US for Total International Admiral for the lower ER? ===

Total International's target index includes both Canada and small cap stocks, which makes the fund look more attractive to many Bogleheads. If you already hold FTSE All-World Ex-US you might be tempted to exchange it for Total International, but you should look at the costs and benefits of the exchange more closely.

If you are holding FTSE All-World Ex-US in your taxable account and have significant unrealized capital gains it is probably not worth making the conversion. The difference between an admiral share ER of 0.14% and 0.15% is a mere -$1/year per $10000 invested. 

A reasonable alternative is to hold your FTSE All-World Ex-US mutual fund and direct new money to Total International.

=== What is foreign tax credit? ===

The [[Foreign tax credit |foreign tax credit]], in our context, is a refund of tax that Vanguard pays in foreign countries on dividends. When Vanguard distributes dividends, they are already reduced by tax paid in foreign countries. With foreign tax credit, you can get that amount back, but you still have to pay Federal income tax on the dividends before the foreign tax is paid. Sorry, foreign tax credit is not free money. 

=== I am running out of tax-advantaged room. Should I put Total Stock Market or FTSE All-World ex-US in a taxable account? ===

In general, you want to put either FTSE All-World ex-US or Total International Index in a taxable account so that you can get a [[foreign tax credit]], but the difference is not that great, so your individual situation may be different. In particular, if your [[401(k)]] has better international funds than US funds, then you probably want to hold the international funds in your 401(k).

=== Should I hold FTSE All-World ex-US or Total International Index in a taxable account for a foreign tax credit even though I have not maxed out my tax-advantaged account? ===

No, you should fill your tax-advantaged accounts first. The main exception is a [[401(k)]] or [[403(b)]] with expenses so high that they negate the benefit of either tax-deferred growth or tax-free growth; you should only invest enough in such an account to get the maximum employer match. Another exception may be a non-deductible Traditional IRA. It may not be a good idea to place a tax-efficient stock index fund in a non-deductible Traditional IRA. See [[Non-deductible Traditional IRA]] for more information.

=== Wow, FTSE All-World ex-US has expense ratio of 0.29%? Should I buy VEU, the ETF share class of FTSE All-World ex-US, to save on the expenses? ===

You can gain admiral share status with the fund for an investment of $10,000. If you take the ETF route, keep in mind that you will likely have to pay a commission on the purchase and sale if you do not purchase directly from Vanguard. In general, ETF shares may be a good choice if:

* you already have a brokerage account which has low commissions (no more than $10 or so),
* you are planning to invest in large lump sum(s), rather than small monthly contributions (which would incur a commission at every purchase),
* your brokerage allows for (free) reinvestment of fund distributions, and

=== I heard that slicing and dicing boosts return. Why go broad? ===
{{Main|Slice and dice international}}

=== The FTSE All-World ex-US lacks small-cap stocks. What should I buy to fill that area? ===
{{Main|Vanguard FTSE All-World ex-US Small-Cap Index Fund}}
The Vanguard Total International Index includes the market weighting of international small cap stocks.

Vanguard now has the [{{vf|1684}} Vanguard FTSE All-World ex-US Small-Cap Index Fund]. If you use this fund, it is more natural to use FTSE All-World ex-US for your large-cap allocation, as the two funds track exactly complementary indexes.

=== I would like some value tilt. What options does Vanguard provide? ===

For a [[Value tilting - stock|value tilt]] you might consider [{{vf|0046}} Vanguard International Value Fund]. If you are interested in growth tilt, consider [{{vf|0081}} Vanguard International Growth Fund]. Both of these are actively managed funds and thus often distribute capital gains. You should consider placing them in a tax-advantaged account.

=== How are the international funds priced when there is always a market open and trading somewhere in the world? ===

Share price, also known as [[Net asset value | ''net asset value'']] (NAV), is calculated each business day as of the close of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange, generally 4 p.m., Eastern Time. This is true for both domestic and international funds.

Stocks held by a Vanguard fund are valued at their ''market value'' when reliable market quotations are readily available. The values of any foreign securities held by a fund are converted into U.S. dollars using an exchange rate obtained from an independent third party.

When reliable market quotations are not readily available, securities are priced at their [[Fair value pricing | ''fair-value'' ]](the amount that the owner might reasonably expect to receive upon the sale of a security). A fund will also use fair-value pricing if the value of a security it holds has been materially affected by events occurring before the fund's pricing time but after the close of the primary markets or exchanges on which the security is traded. This most commonly occurs with foreign securities, which may trade on foreign exchanges that close many hours before the fund's pricing time. Intervening events might be company-specific (e.g. earnings report, merger announcement); country-specific (e.g. natural disaster, economic or political news, act of terrorism, interest rate change); or global. Intervening events include price movements in U.S. markets that are deemed to affect the value of foreign securities.

Fair-value prices are determined according to procedures adopted by a fund's board of trustees. When fair-value pricing is employed, the prices of securities used by a fund to calculate the NAV may differ from quoted or published prices for the same securities.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' shows how you can combine funds to mimic the composition of the U.S. stock market.

Investors who want to invest in a Total Stock Market Index Fund often face a situation where they have to approximate it with the funds available in their employer sponsored plans, perhaps also using funds in other accounts, for example a [[Roth IRA]].

This page shows some examples of how to approximate a Total Stock Market Index Fund with funds that cover specific parts of the market.

==Total stock market index==
This table shows Total Stock Market Index Funds from four different providers. The aim is to approximate these Morningstar [[#Stock market classifications| style boxes]] using available funds chosen from the two-fund and three-fund tables below.

==Table notes==
For the above tables:

* The style box numbers were computed by [https://lt.morningstar.com/3y3wd9echv/xray/editholdings.aspx Morningstar Instant X-Ray] by entering each fund ticker as a holding, and entering the dollar value based on the percentage; for example, for VFIAX at 81% and VEXAX at 19%, enter $81 and $19 respectively and observe the computed Morningstar Style Box on the Instant X-Ray tab. Enter different dollar amounts (always adding up to $100) in a trial and error fashion until you replicate the same computation as Total Stock Market, or as close as you can get. You need a free (or paid) subscription to Morningstar to access Instant Xray.
* Computation used the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_squares method of least squares]
* If you are thinking of using an S&amp;P MidCap 400 fund, for example, you might consider the example above that uses IJH. However, there may be slight implementation differences between the S&amp;P MidCap 400 fund you have access to and IJH.
* Two funds may appear to track the same portion of the market (say, mid-cap), but their holdings may differ depending on the indexes they track.

==Stock market classifications==

===Style box format===

Style boxes use the following format. Numbers shown are percentages. Because values are rounded, the percentages may not total exactly 100%.

{{MStarStylebox| LV | LB | LG | MV | MB | MG | SV | SB | SG}}

===Size===

Stocks may be classified by the size of the corporation. This is most commonly done by market capitalization. [[Market capitalization]] is simply a measurement found by taking a stock's current share price and multiplying it by the number of stock shares outstanding.

Exact market cap ranges will vary among different financial and rating institutions, but there are three different terms commonly used to describe stocks by their general size. 

*'''Large cap stocks''' have a market cap over $10&amp;nbsp;billion.
*'''Mid cap stocks''' have a market cap between $2&amp;nbsp;billion and $10&amp;nbsp;billion.
*'''Small cap stocks''' have a market cap between $300&amp;nbsp;million and $2&amp;nbsp;billion.

The Morningstar style box uses percentages rather than fixed dollar thresholds for size classification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://news.morningstar.com/pdfs/FactSheet_StyleBox_Final.pdf| title=Fact sheet: The new Morningstar style box methodology| publisher=Morningstar| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220822012855/http://news.morningstar.com/pdfs/FactSheet_StyleBox_Final.pdf| archive-date=August 22, 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Style===

Stocks may also be classified by "style," one of '''Value''', '''Blend''', or '''Growth'''. 
* '''Growth stocks''' are companies that are growing their profits at a very fast rate and are expected to continue to grow at an increasing rate. 
* '''Value stocks''' are stocks that tend to trade at deep discount relative to their intrinsic value (as defined by profits, book value, and so on). 

Investors commonly think of growth stocks as "high flying companies" and value stocks as "distressed companies." Both growth and value stocks have taken turns leading and lagging one another during different markets and economic conditions.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;You can see the alternating performance of the growth and value stocks on the [[Callan periodic table of investment returns]], which visualizes performance of different asset classes.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both [[Vanguard target retirement funds|Vanguard Target Retirement Funds]] and [[Vanguard LifeStrategy Funds]] can be used as all-in-one portfolios. This article addresses the similarities and differences between the two series of funds.

{{Notice|Vanguard has an article about [https://personal.vanguard.com/us/content/Funds/FundsVanguardFundsLifeStrategyTargetCompare.jsp comparing Vanguard LifeStrategy Funds and Vanguard Target Retirement Funds]. In addition to what Vanguard already mentioned, you may consider the following.}}

==Minimum investment==
The target retirement funds have a minimum investment of $1,000 for opening an account; this makes it easier for small investors, just beginning their investment careers, to begin an investment program. The LifeStrategy funds have a higher $3,000 minimum investment requirement.

== Control over asset allocation ==
If you selected a target retirement fund based on its current asset allocation, not the target year, you may find that the fund shifts its asset allocation either too soon or too late. For example, suppose you plan to retire in 2030, but you think the 85% stocks 15% allocation in Vanguard Target Retirement 2030 Fund is too aggressive for your need, ability and willingness to take risk. Instead, you like the allocation in Vanguard Target Retirement 2015 Fund, which currently invests approximately 65% in stocks and 35% in bonds. If you invest in Target Retirement 2015, however, at some time close to 2015, the fund will shift its allocation more conservatively, while you are still at least 15 years away from your planned retirement. Or if you'd like to be more aggressive and invest in Target Retirement 2035 while you plan to retire in 2015, you may find the allocation in Target Retirement 2035 not shifting when you need a less aggressive allocation. 

If you invest in a LifeStrategy fund, this problem can be mitigated. You pick an allocation and change your allocation only when you want to. Alternatively, you can still invest in a Target Retirement fund but you have to watch for the allocation changes every year or every few years. If the allocation no longer suits you, switch to a different Target Retirement fund. This is best implemented in a tax deferred or tax free (Roth) account because there are no tax implications for switching. It somewhat defeats the "set it and forget it" appeal of a Target Retirement fund, but it's a good compromise between simplicity and maintaining your desired asset allocation.

== Short-term asset allocation swings ==
From inception in 1994 through the fourth quarter of 2011, all LifeStrategy funds had an allocation to Vanguard Asset Allocation Fund. The underlying asset allocation in Vanguard Asset Allocation Fund changed frequently in the short-term. This caused swings to the asset allocation of LifeStrategy funds. For example, when Vanguard Asset Allocation Fund changed from 60% in stocks to 100% in stocks, LifeStrategy Moderate Growth Fund's allocation also changed from 60% in stocks to 70% in stock.

Vanguard announced a revision in the LifeStragegy funds allocations in a September 30, 2011 web posting&lt;ref&gt;[https://personal.vanguard.com/us/insights/article/fund-announcementB-09302011 LifeStrategy Funds to adopt all-index approach]&lt;/ref&gt;  and instituted an additional change in 2013, adding [[Developed market bonds|international bonds]] to the portfolios.The new allocations  consist of four broad-based index funds:

*Vanguard Total Market Index Fund
*Vanguard Total International Index Fund
*Vanguard Total Bond Market II Index Fund
*Vanguard Total International Bond Index Fund

==Taxes ==
Historical data indicate that if you held the funds in a taxable account (not normally recommended for either one, but the simplicity may be worth the tax costs), the target retirement funds were slightly better options. The LifeStrategy funds held the Vanguard Asset Allocation Fund, which can realize capital gains as it changes its allocation. The revised post 2011 fund choices for the LifeStrategy funds will mean that the LifeStrategy funds can be expected to realize fewer short term and long term gains going forward.

==International allocation==
All target retirement funds and LifeStrategy funds have 40% of the fund's equity allocation in international stocks. The actual portfolio weighting of international stocks will depend on the overall strategic equity allocation of the fund (the range will fall between ~12% and ~36% international stock for target retirement funds&lt;ref&gt; See [[Vanguard target retirement funds#Detailed fund allocations]]&lt;/ref&gt;; and fall between 8% and 32% for the LifeStrategy funds&lt;ref&gt; See [[Vanguard LifeStrategy Funds#Fund allocations]]&lt;/ref&gt;.

The international bond fund represents 30% of the fixed income allocation of LifeStrategy and most target retirement funds. The Income and near-term Target Retirement funds (in the next 10 years) have slightly less international bond allocation due to an increasing allocation to short-term TIPS along the glide path&lt;ref&gt; See [[Glide paths#Target retirement funds glide paths]]&lt;/ref&gt;.

==[[Treasury Inflation Protected Security|TIPs]]==
Some target retirement funds (2020, 2015, and [https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/profile/VTINX Income]) include [[Treasury Inflation Protected Security|TIPS]] while none of the LifeStrategy funds includes [[Treasury Inflation Protected Security|TIPS]].

==Cost==
The target retirement funds and LifeStrategy funds have similar expense ratios.

==History==
LifeStrategy funds have longer history.  They were launched on 30 Sep 1994.  Target retirement funds were launched on 27 Oct 2003 or later.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/mutual-funds/target-retirement-funds| title=Vanguard Target Retirement Funds | publisher=Vanguard| accessdate=September 10, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; are [[target date funds]] designed for retirement. They are lifecycle funds that provide a selection of highly diversified all-in-one portfolios.

These funds are structured as [[fund of funds|funds-of-funds]], and charge only weighted averages of the [[Expense ratios | expense ratios]] of the funds they hold, which are primarily indexed. [https://corporate.vanguard.com/content/corporatesite/us/en/corp/who-we-are/pressroom/vanguard-returns-value-to-shareholders-with-lower-costs-for-target-retirement-funds.html In 2022 Vanguard lowered target date fund expense ratios across the board.]  Although Vanguard designed these funds primarily for someone retiring in a given year (approximately), you can use them for other goals or for significantly different retirement dates, depending on your objectives and [[Risk and return: an introduction|risk tolerance]]. The funds have a low $1,000 minimum investment for opening a fund account.

Except for the [{{vf|0308}} Vanguard Target Retirement Income Fund], each fund has a date specified in its name. The funds become more conservative over time, [[Glide paths |shifting their asset allocations]] from equities toward fixed income.

As of 2023, Vanguard target retirement funds hold a total of about $1.3 trillion in assets&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.plansponsor.com/target-date-assets-reach-record-high-3-5-trillion-in-2023/ Target-Date Assets Reach Record High $3.5 Trillion in 2023]&lt;/ref&gt;, the largest competitor in the market.  

[[Vanguard LifeStrategy funds]] are similar to Target Retirement Funds, but do not have a glide path. You can use both [[Vanguard LifeStrategy Funds|LifeStrategy funds]] and target retirement funds as an all-in-one portfolio.

== Comparison with generic target date funds ==
{{main|Target date funds}}
Vanguard Target date funds are target retirement funds primarily built from index funds and charge expense ratios comparable to the weighted averages of the expense ratios associated with the underlying funds. These are desirable fund characteristics.

As with other target date funds, Vanguard target retirement funds give you diversification and asset allocation on autopilot. Also the criticism are similar: possible mismatch between target retirement year and asset allocation choice, tax inefficiency, and possible unsatisfactory allocation choices. 

On the positive side, Vanguard lowered target date funds expense ratios across the board and now has among the lowest in the industry.&lt;ref&gt;[https://corporate.vanguard.com/content/corporatesite/us/en/corp/who-we-are/pressroom/vanguard-returns-value-to-shareholders-with-lower-costs-for-target-retirement-funds.html Vanguard Returns Value to Shareholders with Lower Costs for Target Retirement Funds]&lt;/ref&gt;  On the negative side, Vanguard target date funds have gained attention for their tax inefficiency compared to other target date funds as well as compared to other Vanguard index fund offerings.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2025/01/23/vanguards-106-million-tdf-settlement-offers-a-key-lesson-about-taxes.html Vanguard's $106 million target-date fund settlement offers a key lesson about taxes]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.morningstar.com/funds/another-capital-gains-season-forget-vanguards-target-date Another Capital Gains Season to Forget for Vanguard’s Target-Date]&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Choosing a Vanguard target retirement fund==

'''Note''': ''Vanguard's [https://personal.vanguard.com/us/planningeducation/general/PEdGPCreateCompInvQuestContent.jsp Investor Questionnaire] is designed to assist investors with choosing an [[Asset allocation|asset allocation]]. (Select: "Begin the Vanguard Investor Questionnaire")''

Target retirement funds are designed for investors who to manage their investments simply. These funds make assumptions about their potential investors; one of which is [[Asset allocation|asset allocation]], the single most important decision an investor has to make. They cannot know the investors [[Risk and return: an introduction|risk]] profile.

When choosing a fund, the Bogleheads recommendation is to ignore the fund's date. Instead, determine the amount of risk you are willing to tolerate and work backwards to find a fund that matches the chosen stock/bond allocation. You may be surprised to find a large discrepancy between the planned retirement date and the fund's target date. Remember that the fund does not know anything about you.

There are some disadvantages to this method ([[#Mismatch between target retirement year and asset allocation choice |see below]]), but if you are starting out then do not be put off. You can always [[Rebalancing|rebalance]] later, especially if you hold the fund in a tax-advantaged account.

==Summary asset allocation==

As of February 8, 2021, Target Retirement Fund asset allocations range from 90/10 (stock/bonds) to 30/70 (stocks/bonds).

==History==

Vanguard launched its first six Target Retirement Funds on 27 October, 2003: Target Retirement 2045, 2035, 2025, 2015, 2005, and Income. It opened five additional funds 7 June, 2006: Target Retirement 2050, 2040, 2030, 2020, and 2010. The Target Retirement 2055 fund was opened on 10 August, 2010, and the Target Retirement 2060 fund was opened on 19 January, 2012. The funds' fiscal year ends on September 30 of each year.

In the years since launching the Target Retirement funds, Vanguard has made two significant changes to the funds' asset allocation: gradually increasing and broadening the international exposure in both equities and bonds; and, in 2006, increasing the funds' asset allocation to equities.

===2006 target retirement changes===

In March 2006 Vanguard changed the asset allocations of its existing Target Retirement Funds, increasing their aggressiveness with a larger equity allocation of roughly 10 to 20 percentage points, depending on the fund.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://us.vocuspr.com/newsroom/Query.aspx?SiteName=vanguardnew&amp;Entity=PRAsset&amp;SF_PRAsset_PRAssetID_EQ=146273&amp;XSL=PressRelease&amp;PublishType=Press+Release&amp;Cache=True| title=Vanguard press release| publisher=Vanguard| date=2006}}{{dead link}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original Target Retirement Fund allocations are provided in the Funds' [http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/752177/000093247103000686/targetretirementprospedgar.txt preliminary prospectus], dated 5 August, 2003.

===2010 target retirement fund changes===

On September 27, 2010, Vanguard announced that it would replace the three underlying international portfolios with a single broad international stock index fund. Vanguard also increased the overall international equity exposure of these funds from approximately 20% to approximately 30% of the equity allocations.

Under the simplified approach, ''most'' of the Target Retirement Funds were comprised of [[:Three-fund portfolio | three broad index funds]]. Target Retirement Funds with target dates greater than five years from the current year offered allocations constructed using only three funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{forum link| t=60713| title=Vanguard:Changes In Target Retirement Funds| date=September 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="VG1"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://institutional.vanguard.com/VGApp/iip/site/institutional/researchcommentary/article?File=NewsTIEqExp| title=Vanguard adjusts international equity exposure in Target Retirement Funds and other balanced funds| publisher=Vanguard}}{{dead link}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://institutional.vanguard.com/VGApp/iip/site/institutional/researchcommentary/article?File=InvComDiversifiesTRF| title=Vanguard streamlines construction and improves diversification of Target Retirement Funds| publisher=Vanguard| date=October 5, 2010| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101020021216/https://institutional.vanguard.com/VGApp/iip/site/institutional/researchcommentary/article?File=InvComDiversifiesTRF| archive-date=October 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the funds transitioned into the Target Income portfolio, the funds added an inflation-indexed bond fund and a money market fund to the strategic asset allocation.

In 2022 Vanguard announced it was reducing their average target date expense ratio to 0.08%.&lt;ref&gt;[https://corporate.vanguard.com/content/corporatesite/us/en/corp/who-we-are/pressroom/vanguard-returns-value-to-shareholders-with-lower-costs-for-target-retirement-funds.html Vanguard Returns Value to Shareholders with Lower Costs for Target Retirement Funds]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|Vanguard funds: life strategy funds vs target retirement funds}}

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' are lifecycle offerings, providing investors with a variety of highly diversified all-in-one portfolios. The products are structured as [[Fund of funds | funds-of-funds]], charging only [[Acquired fund fees and expenses|weighted averages]] of the [[Expense ratios | expense ratios]] associated with the underlying [[Indexing|index]] funds.&lt;ref&gt;[https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/vanguard/LifeStrategyList Lifestrategy Funds], Vanguard official site&lt;/ref&gt; 

LifeStrategy funds are cheap by any reasonable standard. In contrast to the Vanguard series of similar one fund diversified portfolios, [[ Vanguard Target Retirement Funds |target retirement funds]], which use a gradual shifting strategic asset allocation over time, the LifeStrategy funds have a fixed target asset allocation.

Vanguard considers the LifeStrategy funds to be'' target risk funds'', in contrast to ''target date'' target retirement funds. 

==Four portfolios==
While the funds are ostensibly designed for investors having a certain level of risk tolerance (approximately), and are typically considered to be retirement accumulation or retirement decumulation vehicles, you can use them for other goals, depending on your objectives. For example, the LifeStrategy funds are often investment options in many state run [[529 plans]] designed for funding college education expenses.

There are four LifeStrategy funds:

|}

==Fund allocations==

On February 26, 2015, Vanguard announced an increase in the funds' international equity allocation from 30% to 40% of equity exposure, and an increase in the international fixed income allocation from 20% to 30% of nominal fixed income exposure.&lt;ref&gt;[https://personal.vanguard.com/us/insights/article/fund-announcement-02262015 Vanguard enhances diversification for target date funds and other all-in-one funds] 26 Feb 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The tables below show allocations of the funds after the 2015 reset. The reallocation of fund assets was completed by the end of 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[https://institutional.vanguard.com/VGApp/iip/site/institutional/researchcommentary/article/NewsInstinfo022615QA 2015 changes to Target Retirement Funds, Q&amp;A], Vanguard Institutional, February 26, 2015.

==Drawbacks==
While LifeStrategy Funds provide very simple diversification for their shareholders, there are some reasonable criticisms.

===Tax inefficiency===
Because the LifeStrategy Funds all have a significant allocation to taxable bonds, they are most suitable for investors holding their entire portfolios in tax-advantaged accounts. If you have both taxable and tax-advantaged accounts you are generally better served by splitting your equity and fixed income allocations, concentrating on tax-efficient asset location. Among the tax considerations are:
 
* When held in a tax-advantaged account, stocks lose any special benefits they have in a taxable account.&lt;ref group="note"&gt; Potential advantages for holding stocks in a taxable account include:

* Tax-deferred accounts convert long-term capital gains into ordinary income upon distribution; tax rates on long-term capital gains have been, at most times, lower than ordinary income rates.
* Qualified dividends are currently taxed at a lower rate.
* Long-term capital gains are only due when realized, giving another way to defer taxes.
* Ability to harvest losses.
* Ability to donate appreciated shares to charity, avoiding all taxes.
* Estate planning; there is a potential for stepped-up cost basis upon death.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* In a taxable account the bond dividends will get taxed annually at ordinary income rates; when held in tax advantaged accounts this tax can be deferred.
* By holding a balanced fund in a taxable account the investor loses the option to [[Tax loss harvesting | harvest losses]] of individual asset classes.
* The fund has a history of changing asset allocation and targeted asset classes. If the change is not appropriate for you, selling your holding could create an unwanted large capital gains tax liability.

===Allocation choices===
Depending on your personal preferences, the LifeStrategy Funds' asset allocations could be unsatisfactory. For example:
* Certain asset classes are not represented. For example, inflation-protected securities and commodities are entirely absent.
* The funds' asset class weightings do not suit all tastes. If you aim to match global asset allocations, 60% of equities are domestic, which is above the U.S. share by world market capitalization. The portfolios employ asset class funds that are market cap weighted, so the funds are not appropriate if you want to [[Value Tilting - Stock | value "tilt"]] the equity allocation of your U.S. stock holdings. If you want to hold equity REITs in proportion to the weighting of commercial property in the economy, the funds' REITs allocations are represented only to the extent they appear in Total Stock Market Index.

==History==
Vanguard launched all four LifeStrategy Funds on September 30, 1994. Since then the fund has made numerous changes in asset class selections and portfolio allocations.

===Changes in 2011===
Vanguard announced a change in the funds' investment policy on September 30, 2011.&lt;ref group="note"&gt; From 1994-2011 the LifeStrategy funds asset allocations were implemented with these Vanguard fund portfolios:
*Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund
*Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund
*Vanguard Asset Allocation Fund
*Vanguard Total Bond Market II Index Fund
*Vanguard Short-Term Investment Grade Bond Fund&lt;/ref&gt; The funds adopted an all-index fund portfolio and implemented the change across several months following September 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[https://personal.vanguard.com/us/insights/article/fund-announcementB-09302011 LifeStrategy Funds to adopt all-index approach], September 30, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
The portfolio allocation of the funds after the adoption of the all-index fund approach is shown in the following table:

On February 6, 2013, Vanguard announced the addition of a fourth asset class, [[Developed market bonds|international bonds]], to the LifeStrategy fund asset allocation matrix.&lt;ref&gt; [https://personal.vanguard.com/us/insights/article/fund-announcement-02062013 We're introducing Vanguard Total International Bond Index Fund] &lt;/ref&gt;. The new asset allocation changes were completed on May 31, 2013.

      <text bytes="6382" sha1="d4fo1cy0pn93xphk2rdranezulufyvd" xml:space="preserve">'''{{PAGENAME}}''' addresses investor concerns that holding all their investments at [[The Vanguard Group | Vanguard]], an [[investment management company]], may put their life's savings at risk.

Vanguard (and every other US-regulated mutual fund company) does not hold funds directly. Funds are held by third party custodians. Investors who remain uncomfortable holding all of their assets in Vanguard may hold their funds with alternative custodians.

== What if Vanguard went broke? ==

The following explanation was posted by [[Mel Lindauer]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{Forum post| p=148439 |title=All my eggs in one basket?| author=[[Mel Lindauer]]| date=February 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{blockquote|This is a very serious and timely issue, so I'll address it to hopefully set everyone at ease.&lt;br&gt;

First, The Vanguard Group Inc. (VGI) is actually a subsidiary of the various mutual funds, each of which is a separate legal entity. The best way to describe Vanguard's unique structure would be to think of General Motors turned upside down, with Chevrolet, Cadillac, Oldsmobile, Pontiac, etc. as the corporate parents, and General Motors as a subsidiary. If you think of Chevrolet, Cadillac, Oldsmobile, Pontiac, and the other GM divisions as mutual funds, and General Motors (the subsidiary, in this situation) as Vanguard Group Inc., you'll get the picture.

Since VGI is actually owned and funded by the various mutual funds, for all practical purposes, it won't go bankrupt unless all of the various mutual funds that support it went bankrupt. The only way that could happen would be for the value of all of the stocks and/or bonds held by each and every individual Vanguard mutual fund to go to zero. So, forget about Vanguard going bankrupt -- it just isn't going to happen.

It's also important to point out that even if VGI were to somehow go broke, VGI has no recourse to the assets of the funds. Rather, each fund's custodian holds that fund's assets. Even the fund managers do not have custody of their fund's holdings. They simply decide which stocks/bonds to sell, and the custodian actually delivers (in the case of a sale) or takes delivery (in the case of a purchase) of the actual asset.

Another huge and very important difference between Vanguard's mutual funds and the Enrons and WorldComs of the world is that Vanguard is required to "mark to market" (value each fund share based on the value of all of the fund's holdings) each day the market is open. That keeps the fund's books current. This "marking to market" pricing is subject to both routine and spot audits by both the SEC and the Pennsylvania Department of Banking.

One major reason for the lack of problems with mutual funds comes from the fact that they're regulated by the Investment Company Act of 1940, which spells out the legal responsibilities of the mutual funds to their investors. In addition to the provisions of the Investment Company Act of 1940, the SEC also directly regulates mutual funds. While the SEC can investigate fraud allegations against investors at public companies like Enron and WorldCom, where the accounting is much more complex than at mutual funds, it has no authority to set corporate governance rules for these public companies. These are huge differences.

Keep in mind, too, that, despite all of this, if something were to happen to the Vanguard Group (the entity that provides the fund with the administrative services they need to exist), the funds would continue to operate and would simply replace VGI with another entity to provide these same services.

Some have expressed concerns about putting "all their eggs in one basket" by consolidating their investments at Vanguard. There's simply no need to worry about that. Each fund is a separate investment company (and part owner of the Vanguard Group, rather than the other way around). Thus, having all of your investments in several Vanguard funds is tantamount to having your investments spread among a variety of baskets, each independent of the other. So, put your fears to rest; your investments are safe at Vanguard.| author=[[Mel Lindauer]]| title=All my eggs in one basket?}}

== Custody ==
One of the warning signs of the [[wikipedia:Ponzi_scheme|Ponzi schemes]] conducted by [[wikipedia:Bernard_Madoff|Bernie Madoff]] and [[wikipedia:Stanford_Financial_Group|Stanford Financial]] was that both institutions self-custodied their assets.  That is, the same institution was responsible both for managing the assets and for holding them.

By contrast, Vanguard (and every other US-regulated mutual fund company) must custody their assets with a third party.  Many of the funds managed by Vanguard have their assets held with [[wikipedia:JPMorgan_Chase|JPMorgan Chase]].&lt;ref&gt;Some Vanguard funds use other custodians, including The Bank of New York Mellon, Brown Brothers Harriman &amp; Co., and State Street Bank and Trust Company; see Vanguard's publication, "[https://web.archive.org/web/20211025050159/https://personal.vanguard.com/pdf/s317.pdf Your safety is a priority with us]"&lt;/ref&gt; JPMorgan is audited by [https://investor.shareholder.com/jpmorganchase/faq.cfm PriceWaterhouseCoopers],&lt;ref&gt; [https://investor.shareholder.com/jpmorganchase/faq.cfm JPMorgan Chase FAQ], under "Who is JPMorgan Chase's independent auditor?"&lt;/ref&gt; which provides additional, independent verification that Vanguard's funds hold what they're supposed to.

== Alternative custodians ==

While there are many safeguards in place, as described above, some investors remain uncomfortable with the idea of investing entirely through a single custodian or are forced to diversify due to employer contribution plans. For many fund types, it is difficult to find similar availability at close to or equally low cost. However, there are some exceptions for those who seek (or are forced) to diversify custodians.

For example, many alternatives for a [[Three-fund_portfolio | Three-fund portfolio]] are discussed in the [[Three-fund_portfolio#Other_than_Vanguard.2C_Boglehead-style | "Other than Vanguard"]] section of that article.

==Share classes==

Three share classes are available:

*'''Admiral''' (VFSAX), an initial minimum investment of $3,000.
*'''ETF''' (VSS) with no minimums, though transaction costs apply in buying and selling through a brokerage.
*'''Institutional''' (VFSNX) with an initial minimum of $5,000,000

==Advantages==
===Broad coverage===

The fund contains both developed and emerging market stocks, which is the first of its kind. In addition, the broad index should make the fund relatively tax efficient and thus suitable for taxable accounts.
 
===Expense ratio===
The low [[Expense ratios | expense ratio]] of the fund provides efficient access to non-US small cap stocks.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' addresses the most Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) regarding Vanguard small cap funds.

==Basic questions==

===How many small cap funds does Vanguard provide?===
Vanguard currently provides seventeen non-institutional small cap funds: 

{| class=wikitable style="text-align:left"

|-
| Strategic Small-Cap Equity (active small blend) [{{vf|0615}} VSTCX]

| FTSE All World ex. U.S. Small Cap (International) Index [{{vf|1684}} VSFVX]
| S&amp;P Small Cap Value 600 [{{vf|3346}} VIOV]
|}

===What percentage of the total stock market do small caps represent?===

About 10% small caps would equal the weighting of the total stock market. International small cap would also require about 10% to complete the FTSE All World ex. U. S. index. Note that whereas the Vanguard U. S. Total stock market and Total International index funds contain the market weight in small caps, the FTSE Index, holding large and mid cap stocks, does not.

===Are small cap funds necessary in my portfolio?===
If you want to hold small cap allocations at [[Market capitalization |market capitalization]] weightings you can hold a US Total Market Index fund and meet your allocation needs without adding a small cap fund. However, if your [[FAQ small cap funds#My company plan does not have a small cap fund, how can I add one? | employer provided retirement plan]] provides you with an S&amp;P 500 index fund and no other low cost options you may wish to add a small cap fund in your taxable account or personal retirement plan in order to mirror the market. (See [[Approximating total stock market]] for guidance).

You would also want to add a small cap fund to your portfolio if you want to [[FAQ small cap funds#What is "tilting" to small mean and how much should I tilt? | "tilt" ]] your portfolio asset allocation towards higher small cap and/or value weightings than those provided by market cap weighting.

Currently, the Vanguard Total International index fund is the only Vanguard international index fund allocating market weights to international small cap stocks. If you hold any of the other Vanguard international index funds, you might want to add a small cap international index fund to your portfolio. (See [[Vanguard FTSE All-World ex-US Small-Cap Index Fund]] which suggests holding this fund in a 1:9 ratio with the FTSE-All-World ex-US index for market cap weighting. The combination of these two funds is a sensible choice if you want total market weighting, as the funds track exactly complementary indexes. Additional international small cap options are available at [[International small cap]]).

===What are the expected returns of the different funds?=== 
According to [[Historical and expected returns |30 year return ''estimates'']] from [[William Bernstein]] and [[Rick Ferri]] small cap stocks can be expected to provide the following returns:{{#tag:ref|Sources: Portfolios Solutions LLC (2006).

Vanguard index funds can be expected to provide the market return, less expenses and transaction costs. Vanguard active funds offer the hope of providing excess returns to the market, at the risk of providing less than market returns.

===What does "tilting" to small mean and how much should I tilt?=== 
{{Quote
|quote = '''John Bogle on tilting''':&lt;br&gt;"Impressed both by the long-term performance (and recent performance) of value stocks and small-cap stocks, some investors hold the all-market (or S&amp;P 500) index fund as the core, and add a value index fund and a small-cap index fund as satellites. I'm skeptical that any kind of superior performance will endure forever. (Nothing does!) But if you disagree, it would not be unreasonable to hold, say, 85 percent in the core, another 10 percent in value, and another 5 percent in small cap. But doing so increases the risk that your return will fall short of the market's return, so don't push too far."

Financial experts&lt;ref&gt;See John Bogle, [https://personal.vanguard.com/bogle_site/sp20020626.html The Telltale Chart]&lt;/ref&gt; often recommend that investors should use index mutual funds to invest in entire markets, or, invest in funds that approximate the total market. Other portfolio theorists advise holding portfolios that tilt toward small and value stocks.&lt;ref&gt;Eugene Fama Jr., [http://www.dfaus.com/2009/05/the-new-indexing.html The New Indexing], July 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Truman A. Clark, [http://www.dfaus.com/2009/05/the-dimensions-of-stock-returns-2007.html The Dimensions of Stock Returns], September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In general, the stock market is composed of 3 levels of [[Market capitalization | market capitalization]] and 3 [[Stock basics#Style | styles]], resulting in a 3 x 3 "style" box. For example, this Total Stock Market Index fund style box (numbers shown are percentages):

{{MStarStylebox|12 | 25 | 34| 6 | 9 | 5 | 3 | 3 | 2}}

As defined in the style box for VTSMX,&lt;ref&gt;[{{vf|0085}} Vanguard's Total Stock Market Index Fund (VTSMX)] approximates the total market by investing in over 3,000 stocks, which is representative of the whole U.S. market&lt;/ref&gt; the majority of the US Market (the Total Stock Market or "TSM") is held in large caps. Therefore, this fund (representing the US Market, or the "Market") is defined as a "''cap weighted''" market.

[[Image:CoffeeHouse_Portfolio.PNG|thumb|200px| Bill Shultheis' Coffeehouse Portfolio, employing 4x25 value and small cap tilts]]

The intent is that these distribution percentages, by definition, accurately represent the composition of the entire market. Gain and loss over time represents the movement of the market as a whole.

If you invest $1.00 in a total market index fund, each stock receives the same amount of your dollar in proportion to its cap weight. The largest stock gets 100 times the amount of a company 100th its size. Therefore, no company gets more or less than that determined by its market capitalization. 

The Small cap styles represent 8% (3 + 3 + 2) of the total market. ''Tilting to Small'' means overweighting your portfolio to hold more than 8% of Small cap stocks. 

Historically, value stocks and small stocks have provided higher returns than large blend and growth stocks (in both domestic and foreign markets). The theoretical basis posited for these higher returns states that small stocks and value stocks are riskier than large and growth stocks, and that the higher returns compensate investors for higher risk.&lt;ref&gt; Rolf W. Banz, "The Relationship Between Return and Market Value of Common Stocks," Journal of Financial Economics, 9 (1981), pp. 3-18 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Davis, James L., [[Fama%2C_Eugene_F.]] and [[French%2C_Kenneth_R.]], "Characteristics, Covariances, and Average Returns: 1929-1997" (February 1999). Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP) Working Paper No. 471. Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=98678 or DOI: 10.2139/ssrn.98678 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Fama%2C_Eugene_F.]] and [[French%2C_Kenneth_R.]], "Value Versus Growth: The International Evidence" (August 1997). Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=2358 or DOI: 10.2139/ssrn.2358 &lt;/ref&gt; Based on theory and past performance, some investors choose to add additional value and small stocks to their portfolios. Many investors who tilt employ what is termed a 4x25 allocation consisting of equal parts of 25% large blend; 25% large value; 25% small blend; and 25% small value. Tilters employ blend indexes for growth stock exposure in response to the long term performance of small cap growth stocks.&lt;ref&gt; [[William Bernstein]], [http://www.efficientfrontier.com/ef/499/scg.htm Small Cap Growth Indexing and the Multifactor Threestep],''Efficient Frontier'', April, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; [[William Bernstein]], [http://www.efficientfrontier.com/ef/701/sg.htm The Small-Growth Indexing Anomaly], ''Efficient Frontier'', Summer 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Other tilters, valuing greater portfolio simplicity, overweight small value stocks by adding a small value fund to the market portfolio (see John Bogle on tilting in the sidebox quote).&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Sample portfolios using small cap tilts are included in [[Lazy portfolios]]:
*[[Lazy portfolios#Bill Schultheis's "Coffeehouse" Portfolio]]
*[[Lazy portfolios#William Bernstein's "Coward's" Portfolio]]
*[[Lazy portfolios#Frank Armstrong's "Ideal Index" Portfolio]]&lt;/ref&gt; Overweight means increasing your holdings to more than is naturally in the market profile. 

====Considerations====
*In some cases (higher expected returns), tilting can allow the investor to add more fixed-income securities (bonds) and less equity to the total portfolio.
*The investor's behavior during bear and bull markets can influence results. An investor who tilts must be able to hold to the allocation during periods when the tilted equity portfolio under performs the market portfolio. An investor should also resist the temptation to engage in "performance chasing", that is buying or selling a size or style tilt based on recent performance. 
*Tilted portfolios require long holding periods as the market, value, and size factor returns often rotate over time.&lt;ref&gt; [[William Bernstein]], [http://www.efficientfrontier.com/ef/700/factors.htm Factor Rotation], ''Efficient Frontier'', Summer 2000. &lt;/ref&gt;
*Although small and value stocks have higher expected returns than growth stocks, investors should recognize that the record of realized returns does not assure a similar pattern in the future. The timing and magnitude of the size and value premiums will always be uncertain, i.e. past performance does not predict future performance.

===My company plan does not have a small cap fund, how can I add one?=== 
If you would like to invest in a small cap fund outside of your company plan you can place the investment in either your personal retirement plan ([[Traditional IRA]] or [[Roth IRA]]) or in your taxable account. (For guidance on asset location considerations refer to [[Principles of tax-efficient fund placement]]).

===How tax-efficient are the small cap funds?=== 
Actively managed small cap funds are not very tax efficient. Active funds tend to distribute hefty capital gains distributions. Vanguard small cap index funds are currently very tax efficient as a result of the following three factors:
# The benchmarking of the funds to [[CRSP equity indexes|CRSP]] and[[:Category:FTSE indexes | FTSE indexes]] which use transition bands between size and valuation metrics. These bands tend to reduce the turnover of stocks as they migrate across indexes, which helps reduce taxable gain realization.
# The accumulation of realized loss carryforwards from the 2000-2002 and 2008 bear markets. These carryforwards were applied to offset future realized gains in the funds through fiscal year 2017. Active small cap funds tend to realize gains at a much quicker rate than do index funds. This tendency results in active funds depleting loss carryforwards much faster than index funds.
# The ETF share classes of Vanguard index funds, through the institutional creation and redemption process of [[ETF]] shares, serve to enhance the funds' tax efficiency by gradually removing low basis stock from the fund portfolios and by stabilizing the funds' level of loss carryforwards.

Under current law, [[Qualified dividend | qualified dividends]] are taxed at lower capital gains tax rates. The qualified dividends a small cap index fund passes on to shareholders is reduced by the holding periods of a fund's purchases and sales of stocks and by the extent of a fund's holding of [[REIT]]s, whose dividends are unqualified.
Small cap value index funds provide higher dividend payouts than do small growth or small blend indexes.

The [[Vanguard FTSE All-World ex-US Small-Cap Index Fund]], like a majority of [[International small cap#tax efficiency|international small cap funds and ETFs]], has distributed a small capital gain early in its history. The fund's passive management approach and ETF share class structure should result in improved tax efficiency over the long term. The fund also qualifies for the [[foreign tax credit]] for taxable investors.

      <text bytes="2832" sha1="k4m1e79x3kc7i0i969wdv8kh4q8uixj" xml:space="preserve">The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' ([{{Vf | 0056}} VGSTX]) is a [[Balanced fund|balanced fund]] composed of approximately 60% stocks, 40% bonds. The fund, along with the series of [[Vanguard target retirement funds]], has a $1,000 minimum investment, lower than the typical $3,000 minimum investment threshold for most Vanguard funds. The fund is sometimes suggested in the Bogleheads forum as a suitable mutual fund for investors who are just getting started and cannot meet a $3,000 minimum.

==Basic features==

The STAR fund is a [[Fund of funds |fund-of-funds]]. The STAR fund invests in a selection of Vanguard mutual funds, all of which are actively managed. It has an [[Acquired fund fees and expenses|acquired fund fee and expenses]] (AFFE) expense ratio of 0.3%, typical of Vanguard's expense ratios for its active funds and low by general industry standards, but high compared to index funds. As with other funds-of-funds, no lower cost admiral shares are offered nor is it available as an [[ETF]].

As a 60/40 balanced fund, the fund might be compared to Vanguard Balanced Index Fund, Vanguard Wellington Fund, [[Vanguard LifeStrategy funds | Vanguard LifeStrategy]] Moderate Growth Fund, and whichever [[Vanguard target retirement funds | Vanguard target retirement fund]] has close to a similar allocation.

==Historical notes==
The fund was created in 1985. In 1987 the New York Times noted:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/10/business/investing-too-many-choices-one-fund-buys-all.html| title=Too Many Choices? One Fund Buys All| date=May 10, 1987| publisher=New York Times| accessdate=August 27, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
{{blockquote|In the past two years, a number of firms have revived the fund-of-funds approach of the 1960s, in which a money manager invests in a variety of mutual funds, rather than directly in stocks or bonds... The Vanguard Group was one of the first organizations to revive the fund-of-funds concept when it offered its STAR Fund, which invests in shares of Vanguard's other mutual funds.}}

According to posters in the Bogleheads forum, STAR is an acronym for "Special Tax-Advantaged Retirement," although it was never limited to retirement accounts; it is one of a group of seven Vanguard funds each of which is formally a "portfolio" within a single "trust," an arcane fact of no practical importance.&lt;ref group="note"&gt; From the annual SEC required [http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/736054/000093247110003821/0000932471-10-003821.txt NSAR filing]:

      <text bytes="2119" sha1="ohlqw97pvzdcibydnsix4dhb2vpy87h" xml:space="preserve">'''Vanguard Portfolio Watch''' is a tool in the [[Vanguard]] website for Vanguard clients.  It breaks down your [[Asset allocation|asset allocation]] (including non-Vanguard funds if you list them), and gives cautions if your portfolio is too far from Vanguard's recommendations (too much in tax-inefficient funds in taxable accounts, unusually high or low weight to international stocks, overweight of large-cap, small-cap, growth, or value).  A caution from Portfolio Watch does not mean that you are doing something wrong, but that you should be sure that what you are doing is deliberate.

The tool can be accessed from [https://personal.vanguard.com/us/whatweoffer/stocksbondscds/tools here] (Portfolio analysis), but you must have an account to use the tool.

== Cautions ==
Vanguard Portfolio Watch does not break down most funds into subclasses properly as it treats most funds as being entirely in their primary stock category rather than breaking the fund down into its component sub-classes. For example, if you have a fund which is 70% large-cap stocks and 30% mid-cap and small-cap stocks, Portfolio Watch may treat the fund as 100% large-cap and incorrectly conclude that you are overweighting large-caps.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' shows how you can combine funds to mimic the composition of the international stock market. Funds can be [[mutual fund]]s, [[index fund]]s or [[exchange-traded fund]]s (ETFs).

Investors who want to invest in the Vanguard Total International Stock Market Index Fund often face a situation where they have to approximate it with the funds available in their employer sponsored plans, perhaps also using funds in other accounts, for example a [[Roth IRA]]. [[Thrift Savings Plan]] investors, for example, face this issue with the [[I Fund]] (based on [[MSCI EAFE index]]), which lacks [[Emerging market stocks|emerging markets]], [[International Small-Cap|small-cap]] stocks, and Canadian stocks.

==Total international stock market index==
This table shows Total International Stock Market Index Funds from two providers. The aim is to approximate these [[Approximating total stock market#Stock market classifications| stock style boxes]] using available funds chosen from the two-fund and EAFE tables below.

Developed and emerging market [[Emerging market stocks#Emerging market indexes| country classifications]] vary depending on the index provider.&lt;ref name=dev-emg&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.spglobal.com/en/research-insights/articles/is-south-korea-crowding-your-emerging-markets-allocation|title= Is South Korea crowding your emerging markets allocation?|publisher=S&amp;P Global|date=November 24, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, it is best if you use both funds from the same provider, as shown in the last three examples above.

==Approximating total international stock with an EAFE fund==
These examples were designed specifically if you need to use a [[MSCI EAFE index| Europe, Australasia and Far East (EAFE)]] index fund, such as the [[I Fund|TSP I Fund]] or the [https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/products/swisx Schwab International Index Fund (SWISX)].

The [[MSCI EAFE index]] does not include:
* [[Emerging market stocks|Emerging markets]]
* [[International small cap|International small-caps]]
* Canadian stocks

You may want to use one of the two boxes depending on whether you have access to an [[MSCI]] or [[FTSE Emerging Index|FTSE]] emerging markets index fund. MSCI classifies South Korea as an emerging market, while FTSE considers it a developed market&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ftserussell.com/blogs/south-korea-developed-or-emerging |title= South Korea: Developed or Emerging?|publisher= FTSE Russell|date= February 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;; this is why box 2 uses a separate South Korea index fund. 

The blended [[expense ratio]]s of the two boxes are 0.10% and 0.12% respectively, assuming that the [https://www.tsp.gov/funds-individual/i-fund/?tab=fees I Fund (0.055%)] takes the place of the MSCI EAFE index fund. You can reduce the expense ratios by using the [https://www.franklintempleton.com/investor/investments-and-solutions/investment-options/etfs/overview/26364/franklin-ftse-canada-etf/FLCA Franklin FTSE Canada ETF (FLCA)] (0.09%) and [https://www.franklintempleton.com/investor/investments-and-solutions/investment-options/etfs/overview/26353/franklin-ftse-south-korea-etf-/FLKR  Franklin FTSE South Korea ETF (FLKR)] (0.09%). These are smaller and more lightly traded than their iShares equivalents, meaning a larger [[bid/ask spread]], but they have much lower expense ratios.

To hold the portfolio in box 1 in the recommended percentage, using the Admiral Class share of the [{{Vf | vfsax}} Vanguard FTSE All-World ex-US Small Cap Index Fund (VFSAX)], the minimum amount you would need for all four funds together is $30,000. This is because 10% of that amount equals the $3,000 fund minimum for VFSAX. Of that $30,000, at least $12,600 must be in the IRA to hold the three funds, with the remaining $17,400 in the I Fund.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;For an older version of the weightings and price calculation, see the [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AueLhNpKZa4XdDdDVEFiZlJKWHlEUFJFVzJBaVlqakE Vanguard Total International Stock Market replication with I Fund] Google Spreadsheet.&lt;/ref&gt; You can avoid this by owning ETF share classes of the Vanguard FTSE All-World ex-US Small Cap Index.

==Canadian investors==

For Canadians, most [[finiki:Registered Retirement Savings Plan|Registered Retirement Savings Plans]] have a brokerage function that let you purchase of securities based in the United States. Consider investing in '''[{{Vf | 3141}} Vanguard Total World Stock Index ETF]''' which samples securities from throughout the entire investable world market. You could then use '''[https://www.vanguardcanada.ca/individual/etfs/etfs-detail-overview.htm?portId=9554 Vanguard MSCI Canada Index ETF]''' and '''[http://ca.ishares.com/product_info/fund/overview/XMD.htm iShares S&amp;P/TSX Completion Index Fund]''' to balance to your desired domestic exposure.

== Methodology ==

All the above collections of funds were weighted in a manner to approximate the Morningstar Style Box, average market cap, and [[#Region and sector comparison|industry and regional weightings]] of the [{{Vf | vxus}} Vanguard Total International Stock ETF (VXUS) (0.08%)].&lt;ref name="Xray" /&gt;

The collection of funds making up the first box in the EAFE table is weighted in the following way:

* '''Small-cap stocks''' are weighted at 10% per [[Vanguard_FTSE_All-World_ex-US_Small-Cap_Index_Fund#Total_Market_Replication|Vanguard FTSE All-World ex-US Small-Cap Index]].
* '''Canadian stocks''' are 6.6% of Vanguard's Total International Stock ETF&lt;ref name="VXUS Portfolio"&gt;{{cite web |url={{Vf | vxus}} |title=Vanguard Total International Stock ETF (VXUS) Portfolio &amp; Management |publisher=Vanguard |date=April 30, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 14.8% of Vanguard's FTSE All-World ex-US Small Cap ETF.&lt;ref name="VSS Portfolio"&gt;{{cite web |url={{Vf | vss}} |title=Vanguard FTSE All-World ex-US Small-Cap ETF (VSS) Portfolio &amp; Management |publisher=Vanguard |date=April 30, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given that Vanguard's international small cap fund overlaps the total international market fund, it was decided to weight the Canadian MSCI fund at 5% of the overall collection of funds (which is 6.6% - (14.8% * 10%)).
* '''Emerging markets''' (per MSCI) are 29.6% of Vanguard's Total International Stock ETF,{{#tag:ref|29.6% = 25.5% FTSE emerging markets + 4.1% South Korea.&lt;ref name="VXUS Portfolio"/&gt;|group=note}} and are 28.3% of the Vanguard FTSE All-World ex-US Small-Cap ETF.{{#tag:ref|28.3% = 23.4% FTSE emerging markets + 4.9% South Korea.&lt;ref name="VSS Portfolio" /&gt;|group=note}} Given that these funds overlap, the MSCI Emerging Markets ETF was weighted at 27% (which is 29.6% - (28.3% * 10%)).
* '''Europe, Australasia, and the Far East (EAFE)''' is everything left over, which is 58%. The '''MSCI EAFE index fund''' is a proxy for the I Fund, Schwab International Index Fund (SWISX) or any MSCI EAFE fund.

== Region and sector comparison ==

When Vanguard's International Total Stock ETF and the collection of funds were compared in Morningstar's X-Ray's different measurements, both were similar. For example, X-Ray compared the geographic regions as (rounded to the nearest 1%):

A few Vanguard funds (and some non-Vanguard funds) which trade assets with high trading costs charge '''purchase fees'''. Unlike loads or commissions charged by brokers, these fees are paid back to the fund, and so benefit fundholders by ensuring that the trading costs caused by shorter-term traders do not reduce the fund value for longer-term investors.

==Why purchase fees exist==
If a fund invests $1,000,000 in stocks with low trading volume, it may lose a significant amount in commissions, [[bid/ask spread]]s, and market impact, and might wind up with only $980,000 worth of stock. If the fund charges a 2% purchase fee, then existing investors are not affected by this purchase, and the new investors who invested the $1,000,000 have $980,000 worth of shares, which is all the fund received. If the fund is an index fund, this arrangement helps the fund track the index.

Many funds with purchase fees also charge [[redemption fee]]s for the same reason; if the fund needs to sell more than it buys, it will incur costs in selling its assets

Purchase fees usually decrease as the fund gets larger, and sometimes go away entirely. Although trading does not become less expensive, the trading costs only apply to net purchases. If the example fund above receives $1,000,000 in sale orders and $2,000,000 in purchase orders, it need only invest $1,000,000 in stock, and the $20,000 lost to trading costs is only 1% of the purchases, which would make a 1% fee a fair charge. If the fund receives equal amounts in sale and purchase orders, then there is no cost.

Vanguard does not charge a purchase fee on reinvested distributions, because it does not need to purchase any securities to reinvest the distributions. Therefore, you may want to reinvest distributions in a fund which charges a purchase fee.

==Avoiding purchase fees==
You can avoid paying a purchase fee by using an [[exchange-traded fund]] (ETF). You will still pay a fee to purchase the fund, because you buy ETFs in a brokerage account, and you will pay a commission, bid-ask spread, and possibly a market impact cost of your own if the ETF has a low trading volume. Compare the costs of the [[mutual fund]] and ETF, including the expense difference; most ETFs have lower costs than Investor shares of the fund but about the same cost as Admiral shares. Therefore, it is often worthwhile to buy an ETF in order to avoid the purchase fees unless you expect to have Admiral shares soon.

Some Vanguard funds (and non-Vanguard funds as well) charge '''redemption fees''' to discourage short-term trading or to compensate long-term holders for the expenses caused by short-term trading. Unlike loads or commissions charged by brokers, these fees are paid back to the fund, and so benefit fundholders.

==Types of fees==

===Short-term trading fees===
Vanguard no longer charges short-term trading fees on any of its funds. It used to impose 2% fees on international funds for selling shares held less than two months, and 1% fees on many aggressive and sector funds for selling shares held less than one year. 

These fees were intended to discourage market timers from investing in the funds; high transaction costs might otherwise need to be passed on to shareholders. Vanguard now believes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://personal.vanguard.com/us/insights/article/fund-announcement-05232012| title=More Vanguard funds eliminate or reduce fees| date=May 23, 2012}}{{dead link}}&lt;/ref&gt; that it is right to reject disruptive transactions, and its ban on selling and then buying the same fund online within 30 days are enough to protect long-term investors against trading costs.

===Permanent redemption fees===
A few funds which trade stocks with high trading costs charge a redemption fee on all shares sold, for the same reason that these funds and many other funds charge a [[purchase fee]]; that is, selling stocks causes a significant cost to the fund, and the cost is charged to the investors who are responsible for it. The purchase and redemption fees tend to decrease as the fund becomes larger.

As of May 2024, the following Vanguard funds charge redemption fees:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/mutual-funds/fees| title=Vanguard mutual fund fees and minimums| publisher=Vanguard| accessdate=May 17, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Global ex-U.S. Real Estate Index Fund Admiral Shares (VGRLX) - 0.25%; also 0.25% purchase fee
* Global ex-U.S. Real Estate Index Fund Institutional Shares (VGRNX) - 0.25%; also 0.25% purchase fee
* International Dividend Appreciation Index Fund Admiral Shares (VIAAX)- 0.25%; also 0.25% purchase fee
* International High Dividend Yield Index Fund Admiral Shares (VIHAX) - 0.25%; also 0.25% purchase fee

These funds have an [[ETF]] class, which does not impose redemption fees because the fund does not incur any costs when an investor buys or sells an ETF on the stock market.

==How Vanguard computes the fees==

For funds with non-permanent redemption fees, shares purchased with reinvested distributions are exempt from the fee, and other shares are assumed to be sold on a first-in-first-out basis, even if you use a different accounting method for tax purposes. Therefore, once you have held the fund for longer than the fee period, you can usually rebalance or sell recently purchased shares for tax loss harvesting without paying a fee.

==How to avoid the fees==

If you are considering investing in a fund with a redemption fee for less than the fee period (for example, as a temporary replacement while tax loss harvesting), or with a permanent fee for a short time, use an [[ETF]] instead; the commissions and bid-ask spreads on buying and selling the ETF are likely to be less than the purchase and redemption fee.

If you would have to pay a fee to redeem a fund which has an ETF share class, you can avoid the fee by converting to ETF shares, and then selling the ETF on the stock market. Compare the cost of the conversion, and the commission and spread on the ETF sale, to the redemption fee.

If you are considering a fund with a permanent redemption fee as a long-term investment, you might ignore the potential fee, as the fee is likely to become much lower or go away by the time you actually sell your shares. However, you should also consider the ETF share class, particularly if you do not expect to reach Admiral shares in the fund (or the fund has no Admiral shares) and will thus have higher ongoing costs.

{{cite web |url=https://www.vanguardcharitable.org |title=  Vanguard Charitable Endowment Program| publisher=Vanguard Charitable Endowment Program| access-date= March 23, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Donor-Advised Funds|donor-advised fund]] which uses [[The Vanguard Group|Vanguard]] [[Mutual fund|mutual funds]] as investment options.

A Program account may have one or two advisors, who are able to recommend grants and otherwise maintain the account. Vanguard's offering has a $25,000 initial minimum contribution, a $5,000 threshold for subsequent contributions, and a $500 minimum grant amount. There is no minimum ongoing balance, but account values under $25,000 will be charged an annual $250 maintenance fee.&lt;ref name="fee_schedule" /&gt; In addition to the typical immediate contributions, the Program accepts revocable deferred gifts, i.e., contributions planned upon a donor's death.

==Investment options and fees==
The Program's annual fee has two components, an administrative fee plus an investment fee. The tiered administrative fee covers the Program's operating costs. It is currently 0.60% per year for the first $500,000 in account value. There are 20 available investment pools, which an advisor may employ in any combination.

==Investment fees==
Pool compositions and annual costs are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.vanguardcharitable.org/investments/all-investment-options |title= Vanguard Charitable Investment Options| publisher=Vanguard Charitable Endowment Program |access-date= March 23, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Succession plan choices==

Account advisors may choose among five options which take effect after they die or become incapacitated. The last selection (Endowed Grant Plan) precludes all others, but account assets may be split among the first four on a percentage basis.

* Retain assets in the account and appoint one or two successor advisor(s).
* Split the assets equally among multiple new accounts, appointing one or two successor advisor(s) for each.
* Make lump sum grants to specified charities.
* Donate the assets to the Vanguard Charitable's General Fund, a permanent endowment supporting grants to various charities chosen by the Board of Trustees.
* Employ the [https://www.vanguardcharitable.org/giving-with-vc/how-it-works/contributions/deferred-giving Endowed Grant Plan], which enables annual grants to one or more charities for a fixed term or in perpetuity, assuming the account balance does not fall below $5,000. An account balance percentage must be specified for each named charity, with the percentages adding to at least 5%.

==Website==
Vanguard Charitable maintains a secure website. An account advisor can log in and perform most common actions, for example, check investment pool prices and balances, recommend one-time or recurring grants, and recommend pool exchanges. There is also the ability to make some contributions of Vanguard mutual fund shares entirely online. Detailed account history is available regarding balances, contributions, grants, and exchanges.

{{Notice|Vanguard has removed ESAs from their college savings offerings (this includes any new accounts that would be established by an asset transfer). Investors have reported that Vanguard will no longer continue to allow contributions to existing ESAs as of 2024. There have also been reports of additional annual $25 fee per fund as of July 2025. There have been mixed reports of Vanguard closing and liquidating the accounts as of late 2025.}}

For a discussion of the ongoing wind down of Vanguard ESA accounts, see {{forum link| t=413048| title=Vanguard retiring Coverdell ESAs}}.

Vanguard previously offered low cost [[Coverdell Education Savings Accounts (ESAs)]] for individuals wishing to save for educational expenses. Among the specific features of the Vanguard ESA were the following:

* The minimum investment for an ESA fund was $2,000
* The minimum amount for subsequent investments was $100
* Special Redemption Fee: $25 per fund per account when fund assets are fully redeemed within three years of the initial deposit
* Account Service Fee: $20 per year for each Vanguard fund in which you have a balance under $10,000 in an account. This fee was waived for Flagship, Voyager Select, and Voyager investors, as well as for investors selecting e-service for the account.

The SEC's [[EDGAR database]] of mutual fund filings contains many historical mutual fund documents. '''{{PAGENAME}}''' attempts to explain the somewhat arcane way the EDGAR database organizes and reports filings.

Vanguard mutual funds are filed and organized at the SEC in a series of fund groups. These are explained, in fund documents, as a series of trusts that contain the mutual funds.{{#tag:ref|From Vanguard Chester Funds:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://personal1.vanguard.com/pub/Pdf/sai059.pdf| title=Supplement Dated February 27, 2025, to the Statement of Additional Information| date=February 27, 2025| accessdate=June 19, 2025| publisher=Vanguard}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quotation|
The Trust was organized as a Maryland corporation in 1984, and was reorganized as a Delaware statutory trust in 1998. The Trust changed its name from Vanguard PRIMECAP Fund to Vanguard Chester Funds in 2003. The Trust is registered with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the 1940 Act) as an open-end management investment company. All Funds within the Trust are classified as diversified within the meaning of the 1940 Act.}}|group="note"}}
These names are likely to be unfamiliar to mutual fund investors, who have probably never heard of entities such as the Vanguard Chester funds, or the Vanguard Valley Forge funds.

While a fund researcher can now search for an individual mutual fund on the EDGAR database,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.sec.gov/search-filings/mutual-funds-search| title=Mutual Funds Search| publisher=SEC.gov| accessdate=June 19, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt; researchers must realize that the fund documents are filed according to the group names. For example, a mutual fund's annual report will normally be included in one file document containing all of the annual reports of the funds in the fund group.

EDGAR uses acronym labels for common fund documents such as annual reports, prospectuses, portfolio holdings, and other reports. 

==Current fund documents==
Vanguard provides a full variety of neatly formatted current fund documents:

==EDGAR documents==
The sections below provide the SEC filing codes for important informational filings from Vanguard funds.

=== Annual and semi-annual reports===
The fund groups' annual and semi-annual reports are filed in two sets of documents. Annual reports since 2004 are filed in N-CSR filings, semi-annual reports in N-CSRS filings. Annual and semi-annual reports beginning in 1994 and extending through 2003 are filed in N-30D filings.

===Prospectus and statement of additional information reports===
The fund groups' fund prospectuses and statements of additional information are combined in a single filing, the 485POS filing.

===Aggregated data reports===
Fund groups make annual and semiannual reporting of complete fund information in reports to the Security and Exchange Commission.

====N-CEN reports====
Beginning in 2018, fund companies report fund information in N-CEN reports. These reports have the advantage of providing descriptive information. The sections containing primary fund information are outlined below:

* Part A: General Information: reporting period covered.
* Part B: Information about the Registrant
:*B8: Directors
:*B9: Chief compliance officer
:*B16: Underwriters
:*B17: Independent public accountant
* Part C: Additional questions

====NSAR reports====
From 1998 to 2018 fund groups made annual and semiannual reporting of complete fund information in NSAR reports. The major difficulty with NSAR filings is the fact that the data is listed without description. Deciphering the document requires having the line by line instructions handy. Among the information provided in the reports:

* Lines 10 - 15: lists the fund Administrator, Principal Underwriter, Shareholder Servicing Agent, Independent Accountant, Affiliated Broker Dealer, and Custodian.
* Lines 20 - 21: detailed breakdown of fund brokerage transactions and brokerage commissions.
* Lines 42 - 54: detailed breakdown of fund 12b-1 expenses. 
* Lines 62 - 70: reports fund fixed income categories and stock market objective.
* Line 71: reports fund turnover.
* Line 72: reports fund income and expenses.
* Line 73: reports payments per share.
* Line 74: reports condensed balance sheet.
* Line 75: reports fund average net assets.

===Fund holdings===
Quarterly stock and bond fund investment holdings are listed in N-Q documents. Money market funds disclose fund holdings each month in N-MFP documents.

===Proxy votes===
How the mutual fund voted in corporate proxies is revealed in N-PX documents.

===EDGAR filings===
* Annual report - N-CSR, N-30D (2004 onwards, pre-2004)
