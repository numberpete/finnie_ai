* A measure of the dispersion of a set of data from its mean. The more spread apart the data, the higher the deviation. Standard deviation is calculated as the square root of variance. 
* In finance, standard deviation is applied to the annual rate of return of an investment to measure the investment's volatility. Standard deviation is also known as historical volatility and is used by investors as a gauge for the amount of expected volatility.

Standard deviation is a statistical measurement that sheds light on historical volatility. For example, a volatile stock will have a high standard deviation while the deviation of a stable blue chip stock will be lower. A large dispersion tells us how much the return on the fund is deviating from the expected normal returns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/standarddeviation.asp| title=Standard Deviation Formula and Uses, vs. Variance| publisher=Investopedia| accessdate=June 20, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Skewness can come in the form of "negative skewness" or "positive skewness", depending on whether data points are skewed to the left (negative skew) or to the right (positive skew) of the data average.

Skewness is extremely important to finance and investing. Most sets of data, including stock prices and asset returns, have either positive or negative skew rather than following the balanced normal distribution (which has a skewness of zero). By knowing which way data is skewed, you can better estimate whether a given (or future) data point will be more or less than the mean. Most advanced economic analysis models study data for skewness and incorporate this into their calculations. Skewness risk is the risk that a model assumes a normal distribution of data when in fact data is skewed to the left or right of the mean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/skewness.asp| title=What Is Skewness?

That is, data sets with high kurtosis tend to have heavy tails, or outliers. Data sets with low kurtosis tend to have light tails, or lack of outliers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/eda/section3/eda35b.htm| title=1.3.5.11.

In computing kurtosis the formula used is μ4/σ4 where μ4 is Pearson’s fourth moment about the mean and sigma is the standard deviation.

The normal distribution (Gaussian) is found to have a kurtosis of three. The formula μ4/σ4 - 3 is the formula for '''excess kurtosis'''. We could then classify a distribution from its excess kurtosis:
* Mesokurtic distributions have excess kurtosis of zero.
* Platykurtic distributions (light tails) have negative excess kurtosis.
* Leptokurtic distributions (heavy tails) have positive excess kurtosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.thoughtco.com/what-is-kurtosis-3126241| title=What Is Kurtosis in Statistics?| publisher=ThoughtCo| accessdate=June 20, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text bytes="5312" sha1="km866irdwwysvllug2degq9wuldfntx" xml:space="preserve">The process of '''matching strategies''' allows an investor planning for retirement to meet specific financial targets with near certainty.  Matching strategies only work with fixed income and insurance products.  There must be a known maturity date for the asset so the timing of the asset and liability can be matched. For this reason, [[stock]]s and [[mutual fund]]s cannot be used in matching strategies.   For the money you ‘must’ have, use matching strategies and for the money you would ‘like’ to have, use diversification and risky assets.

Matching strategies are very safe, but offer little or no upside potential.  Diversification strategies are risky, but offer relatively high expected returns and upside potential.
 
An important reason that matching strategies are safer is because typically they use hedging to mitigate risk.  By hedging risk you are protected against both non-market and market (systemic) risk.  Portfolio strategies mitigate risk through diversification.  By definition diversification can only protect you against non-market risk. A well-diversified portfolio of risky assets provides no protection against market risk.

==Matching strategy examples==
An example of a matching strategy is purchasing a [[zero-coupon bond|zero coupon]] nominal Treasury to pay off your mortgage balance in your targeted retirement year. A higher return would likely be obtained by [[Paying down loans versus investing | simply paying down the mortgage]], but this must be weighed against the liquidity provided by the maturing bond.

A bequest matching strategy is whole life insurance with the heir as beneficiary. For someone who actually lives 25 years or more in retirement a combination of a life annuity and whole life may provide both a higher living standard to the retiree and a larger bequest to the heir than a diversification strategy based on [[Safe Withdrawal Rates | SWR]] (Safe Withdrawal Rate) rules. In any event such a strategy greatly decreases the uncertainty of outcomes to both compared to a diversification strategy.

===Matching strategies for retirement planning===
There are many retirement matching strategies. Here is a list of some major ones.
*[[Social Security]]
*[[Medicare]]
*Pension
*[[:Category:Annuities | Life Annuity]] (particularly inflation-adjusted)
*Medigap insurance
*[[Long-term care insurance | LTCi (Long Term Care insurance)]]
*[[Laddering bonds or CDs |TIPS ladder]]
*Zero coupon Treasury to pay off mortgage balance in target retirement year

It is important to think in terms of ''product diversification'' and ''allocation''. Instead of just focusing on investment diversification (stocks and bonds), manage retirement living standard risk by ''hedging'', ''insuring'', and ''diversifying''. For example:&lt;ref name="bobcat2"&gt;[http://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=1786672#p1786672 Re: It’s the income, stupid!], forum discussion by bobcat2, direct link to post.&lt;/ref&gt;

|}
Diversification of an investment portfolio cannot diversify away market risk, which leaves you with considerable risk exposure in the form of market risk.&lt;ref name="bobcat2" /&gt;

''Hedging'' and ''insuring'' have greater risk reduction. But, unlike portfolio diversification, ''hedging'' offers no upside potential. Also, there is less upside potential with ''insuring'' than there is with ''diversification''. ''Hedging'' and ''insuring'' locks you into part of your retirement income; while portfolio diversification does not.&lt;ref name="bobcat2" /&gt;

==Matching strategies as related to economic principles==
Below is a link to a (very short) paper that puts matching strategies in context with the fundamental principles of economics.&lt;ref&gt;Bodie, Zvi, A Note on Economic Principles and Financial Literacy(April 2006). Networks Financial Institute Policy Brief No. 2006-PB-07. Last revised November 18, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

:[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=923561 A Note on Economic Principles and Financial Literacy]'' (enable browser cookies to download)''

''Abstract:'' Finance is a branch of economics that deals with budgeting, saving, investing, borrowing, lending, insuring, diversifying, and matching. In setting standards of financial literacy we ought to make sure they are consistent with the basic principles taught in economics courses.

      <text bytes="19581" sha1="b17g5m4zdi5ql5px1xs88023jsqr0j5" xml:space="preserve">'''Risk and return''' is a complex topic. There are many types of risk, and many ways to evaluate and measure risk. In investing, one widely used definition of risk is:&lt;ref name="Reilly"&gt;{{cite book| author=Frank K. Reilly| date=1994| title=Investment Analysis and Portfolio Management| page=11| publisher=The Dryden Press, Harcourt Brace College Publishers| isbn=978-0-03-097052-8| ref={{SfnRef|Reilly|1994}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt; At some time in the future, the ''actual'' return will be one of many possible outcomes. The various outcomes have some probability of occurring. The expected return is just the average of these possible returns weighted (multiplied) by the respective probabilities of occurring.&lt;/ref&gt; 
{{blockquote|... the uncertainty that an investment will earn its expected rate of return. |author=Frank K. Reilly| title=''Investment Analysis and Portfolio Management''}}

Notice that this definition does not distinguish between loss and gain. Investors typically think of risk as the possibility that their investments could lose money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Rick Ferri| author-link=Rick Ferri| title=All About Asset Allocation| date=2006| page=23| publisher=McGraw Hill| isbn=978-0-07-142958-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are likely to be quite happy with an investment return that is greater than expected - a "positive surprise." However, because risky assets generate negative surprises as well as positive ones, is is reasonable to define risk as the '''uncertainty''' of returns. Greater uncertainty means that it is more likely that the investment will generate larger gains, as well as more likely that it will generate larger losses (in the short term), and higher or lower accumulated value (in the long term.)

In financial planning, you need to consider your investment goal in order to define which risk matters to you. For example, if you want an acceptable retirement income, you need to build an investment portfolio that generates an ''expected'' return sufficient to create that level of income.

But because it is '''uncertain''' that your portfolio will earn its ''expected'' long-term return, its long-term ''realized'' return may be less than your expected return. In that case, your available retirement funds will be less than you need - that is, ''you might outlive your investment portfolio.'' This is an example of "shortfall risk." The '''magnitude''' and '''consequences''' of this deserve special consideration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author1=Zvi Bodie| author1-link=Zvi Bodie| author2=Paula H. Hogan| url=https://www.aaii.com/features/jrnl200506p16.pdf| title=For Long-Term Investors, the Focus Should Be on Risk| publisher=AAII Journal| accessdate=July 18, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, because it is '''uncertain''', your portfolio could ''also'' have a ''realized'' return that is ''higher'' than your expected return; the ''investment portfolio might "outlive" you.''

As a result, shortfall risk is generally just one part of considering risk as the ''uncertainty of investment return.'' 

==Risk as the uncertainty of returns==
Historical distributions of returns in three major asset classes -- cash, [[Bond basics|bonds]], and [[Stock basics|stocks]] -- demonstrate the uncertainty in investing.&lt;ref name="BKM"&gt;{{cite book| author1=Zvi Bodie| author1-link=Zvi Bodie| author2=Alex Kane| author3=Alan J. Marcus| date=2008| title=Essentials of Investments| pages=129,130| publisher=McGraw Hill| isbn=978-0-07-126324-5| ref={{SfnRef|Bodie et al|2008}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''cash'' usually refers to [[Money Markets|money market]] securities and money in bank accounts. [[Vanguard]] refers to these types of assets as ''short-term reserves.'' There is very high certainty in the return that you would earn on an investment in money market securities such as [[Treasury bills]] (T-Bills) or short-term [[Certificate of Deposit|certificates of deposit]] (CDs). Similarly, there is fairly high certainty in the return that you would earn over a short period in a money market fund. Money market fund holdings consist of T-Bills, CDs, and other money market securities.{{sfn|Bodie et al|2008|p=5}}

For an individual investor, a federally-insured bank account also provides a high degree of certainty in the short-term return.

Even over longer time periods, the returns earned by money market securities fall into a relatively narrow range.

[[File:Range of Annual Returns.jpg|451px|thumb|left|Figure 1. Risk vs. Return: 1928 - 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/histretSP.html| title=Annual Returns on Stock, T.Bonds and T.Bills: 1928 - Current| publisher=Damodaran Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The annual returns on 3-month T-Bills (representing "cash") were in the range of 0% to 15% during the 84 year period from 1928 through 2011. In Figure 1, the vertical bar on the far left (above the label "U.S. Treasury Bills) represents this range of returns. Also note the tick mark showing the average annual return of 4%.

The middle vertical bar in Figure 1 represents the range of annual returns on [[Treasury Bonds|10-Year U.S. Treasury Bonds]] over the same time period. There is a larger range (dispersion) of returns, from about -11% to +33%. Also note the somewhat larger average annual return of 5%.

The far right vertical bar in Figure 1 represents the range of annual returns on U.S. stocks (as represented by stocks in [[S&amp;P 500 Index|the S&amp;P 500]]) over the same time period. There is a much larger dispersion of returns, from about -44% to +53%. Also note that the average annual return of 11% is significantly higher.

As the chart indicates, the return on bonds is less certain than the return on cash, and the return on stocks is less certain than the return on bonds. As a result, bonds are considered riskier than cash, and stocks are considered riskier than bonds.&lt;ref group="note"&gt; Standard deviation is a statistical measure that is often used to quantify the dispersion (variation) of investment returns which provides a standardized way to compare risk for different investments. Standard deviation increases as dispersion of annual returns increases. This is illustrated by the standard deviation of the asset classes shown in the returns history shown in Figure 1.

*US Treasury bills standard deviation 3.04%
*US 10-year Treasury bonds standard deviation 7.78%
*US S&amp;P 500 index of stocks standard deviation 20.11%

Standard deviation of annual returns is most useful for measuring risk over shorter time periods.

For measuring risk over longer time periods, the dispersion of possible '''cumulative''' returns is a better measure of risk. This is because over many years, a relatively small difference in annualized rate of return can result in a large difference in cumulative returns. The cumulative return on your investments at a specified future time is referred to as terminal wealth, and its possible dispersion is referred to as ''terminal wealth dispersion''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author1=Edwin J. Elton| author1-link=Edwin J. Elton| author2=Martin J. Gruber| author2-link=Martin J. Gruber| author3=Stephen J. Brown| author3-link=Stephen J. Brown| author4=William N. Goetzmann| author4-link=William N. Goetzmann| date=2003| title=Modern Portfolio Theory and Investment Analysis| page=49| publisher=Wiley| isbn=978-0-471-23854-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Bodie et al|2008|p=122}}{{sfn|Reilly|1994|p=14}}{{sfn|Bodie et al|2008|p=124}}{{sfn|Bodie et al|2008|p=180}} 

The chart also shows that historically, over the relatively long time period of 84 years from 1928 through 2011, higher risk has been rewarded with higher '''average''' annual returns, at least in the United States. This pattern is not unique to the U.S., but it is not the same in all countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author1=Elroy Dimson| author1-link=Elroy Dimson| author2=Paul R. Marsh| author3=Mike Staunton | date=2002| title=Triumph of the Optimists| publisher=Princeton University Press| isbn=978-0-691-09194-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship between risk and return==

Investors are risk averse; that is, given the same expected return, they will choose the investment for which that return is more certain. Therefore, they demand a higher expected return for riskier assets. A higher ''expected'' return does not guarantee a higher ''realized'' return. Returns on risky assets are uncertain, so an investment may not earn its expected return.

Although the charts in Figure 1 show historical (realized) returns rather than expected (future) returns, they show the relationship between risk and return. The mean (average) annual return increases as the dispersion of returns increases. 

This demonstrates one of the most fundamental axioms of investing:
:''Risk and return are inextricably related. You can generally achieve higher returns only by taking more risk, but because the risk exists, the higher &lt;u&gt;expected&lt;/u&gt; returns &lt;u&gt;may not&lt;/u&gt; result in higher &lt;u&gt;realized&lt;/u&gt; returns.''
If [[Consumer price index|inflation]] is considered, even money market securities have some risk. They may not achieve the expected real (inflation-adjusted) return. Unexpected inflation may reduce the ''real'' return below the ''expected'' return of the money market investment.
You can eliminate uncertainty in real returns by investing in inflation-indexed securities, such as [[Treasury Inflation Protected Securities]] ([[TIPS]]) and [[I Savings Bonds|Series I Savings Bonds]] ([[I Bonds]]). In return for this reduction of uncertainty, you need to accept lower expected returns. Even inflation-linked securities have risks; for example, TIPS have interest-rate risk, re-investment risk, and liquidity risk. No investment is truly risk-free.

==Managing portfolio risk==

===Diversification===
You can reduce risk through diversification.

The risk of investing in a single risky security, such as a stock or corporate bond, is very high due to the company-specific risks. Any number of unfortunate events could impact the rate of return. In the worst possible case, the company could go bankrupt, and you could lose the entire value of the investment. Company-specific risk is generally referred to as unsystematic risk or non-systematic risk. Other names are unique-risk, firm-specific risk, or diversifiable risk.

You can eliminate unsystematic risk by holding a broad portfolio of risky assets; that is, many different securities in many different industries. This is easily done by owning a total market stock or bond index fund. Unsystematic risk is risk that can be "diversified away."

The risk that remains after diversifying away unsystematic risk is systematic risk. Other names are market risk or non-diversifiable risk. A total stock or bond market fund has systematic risk. This is risk impacting an entire asset class, such as when rising real interest rates impact the entire bond market.

In an efficient market, assets with known systematic risks will be priced lower, and so compensate with higher expected returns. This expected relationship only applies to systematic risks. There is no reward for incurring unsystematic risk, and you may therefore use broad diversification without reducing the expected return of their portfolio.

===Asset allocation===
{{Main | Asset allocation}}
After diversification, the next step in managing your portfolio risk is asset allocation.

In '''theory''', asset allocation means selecting an appropriate mix of risk-free assets and risky assets. Optimally, the risky portion of your portfolio includes all risky assets; for example, stocks, bonds, real estate, and so on. A 30-day T-Bill is most commonly used to represent the risk-free asset.

In '''practice''', short-term, high quality bonds are considered to be relatively risk free, and so are typically considered part of the (relatively) risk-free portion of your portfolio. Although a bond fund that includes riskier bonds (for example, corporate bonds and bonds with longer maturities) is technically a risky asset, the risk is low in comparison to stocks. When investing according to the [[Bogleheads® investment philosophy]], you would generally use broad-based, short- to intermediate-term bond funds for the low-risk portion of your portfolio, and broad-based stock funds for the risky portion of your portfolio. 

Selecting the appropriate asset allocation (ratio of risky assets to low-risk assets) [[Bogleheads® investment philosophy#Never bear too much or too little risk | ''is essential'']] to designing a portfolio that matches your ability, willingness, and need to take risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Larry Swedroe| author-link=Larry Swedroe| title=The Only Guide You'll Ever Need for the Right Financial Plan| publisher=Bloomberg Press| date=2010| isbn=978-0-470-92971-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==An illustrative example==
{{Main | Risk and return: application}}
For an illustrative example which shows how you can use these ideas to plan a portfolio, see [[Risk and return: application]].&lt;ref group="note"&gt;For those who have never experienced a significant downturn in the market, please read {{forum link| p=329947| title=Bear Markets| date=November 15, 2008}} by [[Taylor Larimore]]. Here is an excerpt:
{{blockquote|Figures cannot convey the horrifying and debilitating effects of a deep and long bear market. You watch in agony as month after month your life savings evaporate before your eyes. Gloom and doom articles are in the media, radio, (and now TV and internet). Nearly everyone else is selling. You have no idea when, or if, your portfolio will stop losing money.

Your friends and relatives urge you to sell. Nearly all financial experts recommend "sell". You are ridiculed for trying to hold on. You begin to have self-doubt. Despair sets in. Buying stocks is unthinkable. Suicides increase.

That's what a bad bear market is like.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Specific types of risk==
Below are descriptions of different types of investment risks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author1=Michael Dalton| author2=James Dalton| title=Personal Financial Planning: Theory and Practice| edition=Second| publisher=Dalton Publishing| date=2001| isbn=978-1-931629-02-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[prospectus|mutual fund prospectus]] will often outline these types of risk. 

Portfolio theory makes an important distinction between two types of risks:

*'''Unsystematic risk''': The measure of risk associated with a particular security; also known as '''diversifiable risk'''. You can reduce [http://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/unsystematicrisk.asp Unsystematic risk] by holding a diversified portfolio of many different stocks in many different industries.
*'''Systematic risk''': Also known as '''market risk'''. Because of market volatility, all investors face [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/systematicrisk.asp Systematic risk]. This risk cannot be diversified away. This is the type of risk most people are referring to when they casually use the term "risk" when discussing investments.

Some additional risks faced by all investments include:

*'''Liquidity risk''': The risk that an asset cannot be sold when needed, or in sufficient quantity, because opportunities are limited. Treasury securities (with the exception of inflation protected Treasury bonds) have the least liquidity risk.
*'''Political risk''': The risk to an investment from changes in the law or political regime. Potential changes in tax law or changes in a country's structure of governance are sources of political risk. 
*'''Inflation risk''': Stocks, bonds and cash are all subject to the risk that investments will not keep pace with inflation. You can reduce this risk by investing in inflation-protected Treasury bonds, such as [[Treasury Inflation Protected Security| TIPS]] or [[I Savings Bonds | I-bonds]].
*'''Financial risk''': The risk from the capital structure of a firm. Corporate debt magnifies financial risk to a company's stocks and bonds. 
*'''Management risk''': Investors using actively managed funds have the risk that fund or portfolio managers will under-perform benchmarks because of their management decisions or style. You can avoid this risk by selecting passively-managed index funds.

Bond investors also face the following major risks:

*'''Interest rate risk''': The risk associated with changes in asset price due to changes in interest rates. Bonds and bond funds face this type of risk. As interest rates rise, prices on existing bonds decline and vice versa. Interest rate risk is greater for bonds with longer maturities, and lower for bonds having short maturities.
*'''Credit risk''': The risk of default. Holders of corporate and municipal bonds face this risk. 

[[Bond basics#Risks |Other risks]] applicable to bond investments include:

*'''Call risk''': The risk that after a decline in interest rates, a bond issuer could redeem a bond early, forcing you to find a replacement investment that may not pay as well as the original bond. 
*'''Reinvestment risk''': The risk that earnings from current investments will not be reinvested at the same rate of return as current investment yields. Coupon payments from a bond may suffer reinvestment risk if you cannot reinvest them at the same rate as the bond's yield. 
*'''Currency risk''': Investors in international stocks and bonds are also exposed to the risk from changes in currency exchange rates. Investments in currencies other than the one in which you purchase most goods and services are subject to currency risk.

Individual investors are exposed to two additional risks:
*'''Longevity risk''': The risk they will outlive their money.
*'''Shortfall risk''': The risk the portfolio will not provide sufficient returns to meet their goal(s).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://personal.vanguard.com/us/LiteratureRequest?FW_Activity=ViewOnlineActivity&amp;vendorID=S537&amp;FW_Event=start&amp;search_mode=true&amp;cbdForceDomain=false| title=Vanguard’s Investment Philosophy We Believe #7}}{{dead link}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Bogle]] states:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://johncbogle.com/speeches/JCB_NE_Pension_4-00.pdf| title=Risk and Risk Control in an Era of Confidence (or is it Greed?)| author=John Bogle| author-link=John Bogle}} (Footnote 3) Lawrence Siegel, the treasurer of the Ford Foundation, writing in the Journal of Portfolio Management.

{{blockquote|Consideration of bonds as an important asset class implicitly requires us to recognize, as I quoted in "Common Sense on Mutual Funds", that “risk is not short-term volatility, for the long term investor can afford to ignore that. Rather, because there is not a predestined rate of return, only an expected one that may not be realized, the risk is the possibility that, in the long-run, stock returns will be terrible." Put another way, the risk is that the investment portfolio might not provide its owner—individual or institution—with adequate cash to meet future requirements for essential outlays. In short, that the investor will lose a ton of money, just when it is needed the most.|[[John Bogle]]}}

==Definition of risk==
There are two dimensions to risk:
#Probability of failure
#Magnitude of failure

Risk is the product of those two dimensions:
:Risk = (Probability of failure) x (Magnitude of failure)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=1162119#p1162119 Redefining risk], forum discussion, direct link to post.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, two portfolios have a real withdrawal amount of $30,000 per year for 30 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=1163546#p1163546 Redefining risk], forum discussion, direct link to post.&lt;/ref&gt;

*Portfolio A: 70% stocks /30% bonds, with a 4% failure rate at the given withdrawal rate
*Portfolio B: 30% stocks /70% bonds, with a 6% failure rate at the given withdrawal rate

The total risk ''value'' is therefore:
*Portfolio A = .04 x $190,000 = $7,600
*Portfolio B = .06 x $100,000 = $6,000

Portfolio B is less risky because it avoids the big losses in the early years that sometimes devastate Portfolio A. For example, a 50% stock market decline in first 3 years of retirement. 

Risk is also defined as the chance that an investment's actual return will be different than expected. This includes the possibility of losing some or all of the original investment. Risk related to an investment is often called ''investment risk''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk#In_finance Risk (in finance)], from Wikipedia.&lt;/ref&gt;

See: [http://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=83960 Risk - A Primer]

==Risk transfer techniques==
Much financial risk is handled by risk transfer techniques.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=964361#p964361 What do bogleheads *not* agree on?], forum discussion, direct link to post.&lt;/ref&gt; The three risk transfer techniques are hedging, insuring, and diversifying.

*'''Hedging risk:''' A hedging risk technique means giving up upside potential in return for locking in a known value. For example, when you purchase a life annuity you are hedging retirement income risk.
*'''Insuring risk:''' An insuring risk technique means paying a premium to ensure a floor, but, unlike hedging, keep some upside potential.
*'''Diversifying risk:''' A diversifying risk technique does not lock in anything, but you don’t pay a premium and you have unlimited upside potential.

Risk strategies that rely on hedging and insuring are called [[Matching strategy | ''matching strategies'']] because they match assets to liabilities. Risk strategies based on diversifying are simply called [[diversification]] strategies.

Most Bogleheads handle investment risk solely through diversification strategies. The minority of Bogleheads that employ matching strategies typically rely on all three risk transfer techniques, but emphasize hedging and insuring over diversifying when handling investment risk.

For many households the two main financial goals are paying for a child’s college education and providing for adequate income in retirement to meet their retirement living standard goal. Here are examples between the two schools of risk management on meeting those two primary financial goals.

===Saving and investing for a child’s college education===
The ''diversification-only'' risk management Bogleheads save and invest in [[529 plans | 529 college cost plans]] and are concerned about which plans offer the best combination of risky and low risk mutual funds at low cost.

The ''matching strategy first'' risk management Bogleheads emphasize [[529 plans#529 Prepaid Plans | pre-paid tuition plans]], [[Treasury Inflation Protected Securities | TIPS]], and [[I savings bonds | I-bonds]] when saving and investing for college costs. While they may use some equity mutual funds in the investment plan, such mutual fund products are secondary in the overall college cost investment plan.

===Saving and investing for retirement===
The ''diversification-only'' risk management Bogleheads set an [[Asset allocation | asset allocation]] strategy in their retirement portfolio between risky and less risky assets that they believe will maximize their expected return given the amount of portfolio volatility they are willing to tolerate. They then rebalance to this asset allocation over time, or rebalance the asset allocation and also adjust the asset allocation for age over time.

The ''matching strategy first'' Bogleheads set an annual income target for retirement. They then decide how much of that income target should be met by a combination of relatively safe matching strategy assets such as [[Social Security]], [[Defined benefit pension plan | Defined Benefit pensions]], [[:Category:Annuities | life annuities]], and TIPS ladders. In pre-retirement they set aside a part of their portfolio in safe assets such as TIPS to hedge and ensure that they will reach the level of assets they will need at retirement to purchase safe retirement income assets, e.g. a life annuity, to meet their retirement matching income sub-target. The remainder of the retirement portfolio uses diversification strategies among risky and less risky investment assets in an effort to fund retirement income above the matching income sub-target.

Matching strategies using hedging and insuring risk management techniques control downside financial risk much more tightly than diversification strategies, but at the cost of giving up most or all upside potential above the target level of financial assets required to meet a financial goal. Diversification strategies offer unlimited upside potential, but much less downside risk control compared to matching strategies. There is a fundamental disagreement about how this risk/return tradeoff should be managed among Bogleheads.

==Portfolio return risk statistics==
Portfolio returns are expected to follow a [[:#External links | normal]] distribution. Deviations from this pattern are a form of investment risk.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk#In_finance Risk] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_risk Financial risk], from Wikipedia.&lt;/ref&gt;

Understanding and avoiding '''behavioral pitfalls''' has a greater final impact on your investing success than any other factor. Because emotions and subsequent behavioral pitfalls often lead to miscalculating [[risk tolerance]] and [[Asset allocation|asset allocation]], you need to be aware of behavioral pitfalls before making asset allocation decisions. 

{{Quotation|"Your investing brain does not just add and multiply and estimate and evaluate," says Jason Zweig in his book, ''Your Money and Your Brain''.&lt;ref name="Zwieg"&gt;{{cite book| title=Your Money and Your Brain: How the New Science of Neuroeconomics Can Help Make You Rich| publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster| date=August 1, 2007| isbn=978-0-7432-7668-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; "When you win, lose, or risk money, you stir up some of the most profound emotions a human being can ever feel."|Jason Zweig}}

{{Quotation|"Financial decision-making," says psychologist [[Daniel Kahneman]] in Zweig’s book, "is not necessarily about money. It’s also about intangible motives like avoiding regret or achieving pride."|Daniel Kahneman}}

==Common behavioral  pitfalls==
===Anchoring===
Basing decisions on a past value or event (the "anchor"), even though the value or event has no relevance to the decision. For example, we tend to hang on to losing investments by waiting for the investment to break even at the price at which we bought it. As a result, we anchor the value of our investment to the value it once had, and instead of selling it to realize the loss, we increase risk by holding it and hoping it will go back up to its purchase price.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/anchoring.asp| title=Anchoring in Investing: Overview and Examples| publisher=Investopedia| date=May 20, 2021| accessdate=June 1, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note" name="freebeer"&gt;An example of ''framing effect'' (a form of anchoring) and ''confirmation bias'' on purchasing homeowners insurance is in this {{forum post| p=1789459| title=Re: Sometimes Safer NOT to Carry Homeowners Insurance (!?)}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
===Confirmation bias===
A tendency to seek information that confirms our existing opinions, and overlook or ignore information that refutes them. For example, when researching an investment, we inadvertently look for information that supports our beliefs, and miss information that presents different ideas. The resulting one-sided view can result in a poor investment choice.&lt;ref name="confirm"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/confirmation-bias.asp| title=Confirmation Bias: Overview and Types and Impact| publisher=Investopedia| date=September 29, 2022| accessdate=June 1, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; "In short, your own mind acts like a compulsive yes-man who echoes whatever you want to believe," says Wall Street Journal columnist Jason Zweig.&lt;ref name="Zwieg"/&gt;&lt;ref group="note" name="freebeer" /&gt;

===Endowment effect===
The tendency to value something you already own more highly than its market value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/endowment-effect.asp| title=Endowment Effect: Definition, What Causes It, and Example| publisher=Investopedia| date=February 17, 2023| accessdate=October 29, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt; Employer stock options or restricted stock units (RSUs) might be one example. With these, you receive a part of your employment compensation as shares in your employer. The endowment effect would be if you hold on to these shares, where had you instead received this compensation as cash you would not have used it to buy them. Another example might be if you inherit shares that you would not otherwise buy and continue to hold them, rather than selling and then investing the proceeds in your own choice of shares or funds.

===Framing effect===
The large changes of preferences that are sometimes caused by inconsequential variations in the wording of a choice problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Daniel Kahneman| author-link=Daniel Kahneman| title=Thinking, Fast and Slow| chapter=Chapter 7, A Machine for Jumping to Conclusions| isbn=978-0-14-103357-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, purchasing an item. The price is advertised as either (1) "$10.00 with a $0.50 cash discount" or (2) "$9.50 and a $0.50 credit card premium." The price is the same. But we feel much better with the first choice (allowing a discount), than with the second (adding a premium).&lt;ref group="note" name="freebeer" /&gt;

===Gambler's fallacy===
The belief that heads on a coin flip is more likely after a string of tails, red in roulette is more likely after a string of black, and in general good luck is more likely after a string of bad luck, and vice versa. We may expect an investment that has recently experienced losses to "revert to the mean" of its former upward trajectory, or anticipate increased risk after a period of steady gains. While examples of these patterns are easy to find in the past, they are of little value in predicting the future.

===Herd behavior===
A human instinct that causes people to mimic the actions of a larger group rather than decide independently based on their own information. For example, in a bull market, we join the crowd to avoid being the only one to miss out; in a bear market, we get out to avoid being the only one to lose. In both cases, we abandon our own reasoning and conclude the majority must be right. Herd investors often do not have a sound investment plan and they listen to market noise.&lt;ref name="BogleheadsGuide"/&gt;

===Loss aversion===
Loss aversion is the emotional tendency to strongly prefer avoiding losses over acquiring gains. As an example, loss aversion implies that if we lose $100, our emotional pain is much larger than the satisfaction we would feel from receiving $100. Common indications include checking your portfolio on an almost daily basis, selling funds before you intended to lock in profits, or selling when you did not intend to in order to avoid further losses.

===Mental accounting===
Our tendency to put money into separate accounts based on a variety of subjective criteria, for example, the source of the money and intent for each account. According to the theory, we may assign different functions to each asset group, which has an often irrational and detrimental effect on their consumption decisions and other behaviors. For example, people often have a special "money jar" or fund set aside for a vacation or a new home, while still carrying substantial credit card debt. 

===Money illusion===
Money illusion is a tendency to think of money in nominal terms, instead of inflation-adjusted terms. For example, some people will be happy to get a 1% nominal return on an ''safe'' investment during a year when inflation was 2%, yet they would be unhappy with a 1% loss on the same investment in a year with no inflation, despite the two situations representing a 1% annual loss in inflation-adjusted terms. Money illusion can lead us to underestimate the loss to inflation of a fixed nominal income stream over time, or to overestimate the value of a promised nominal income stream that starts far into the future.

===Myopic loss aversion===
Myopic loss aversion is loss aversion intensified by constant attention to short-term portfolio performance. This behavior leads us to focus on recent losses, which increases trading without paying attention to our overall portfolio or the long term view. Myopic loss aversion causes poor portfolio management and lower returns. It also may help explain the equity risk premium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://mutualfunds.com/expert-analysis/myopic-loss-aversion-and-the-equity-risk-premium-puzzle/| title=Myopic Loss Aversion and the Equity Risk Premium Puzzle| author=Larry Swedroe| author-link=Larry Swedroe| publisher=MutualFunds.com| date=October 12, 2016| accessdate=June 1, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Overconfidence===
Being overconfident in our investing abilities can lead to big investing losses. In the short term, the ups and downs of the stock market are random. These unpredictable variations mean that intelligence, skill, and knowledge give us no edge, and thinking they do can be "hazardous to your wealth."&lt;ref name="BogleheadsGuide"&gt;{{cite book| author1=Taylor Larimore| author1-link=Taylor Larimore| author2=Mel Lindauer| author2-link=Mel Lindauer| author3=Michael LeBoeuf| author3-link=Michael LeBoeuf| title=The Bogleheads' Guide to Investing| chapter=Chapter 19, Mastering Investments Means Mastering Emotions| publisher=Wiley| edition=1| date=September 28, 2007| isbn=978-0-470-06736-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The only way to achieve everything you’re capable of is to accept what you are not capable of," says Jason Zweig.&lt;ref name="Zwieg"/&gt;

===Paralysis by analysis===
We have thousands of funds to choose from, and an abundance of market "noise" telling us what we should do. The more choices we have, the harder it is for us to choose one, making it more likely we will not make a choice and will fail to invest. For example, employees pass up billions every year in free money offered by their employer’s matching retirement plans. They do this simply because they cannot decide which investment course to take.&lt;ref name="BogleheadsGuide"/&gt;

===Recency bias===
The tendency to draw conclusions about the future behavior of an investment from only the recent past. This leads to us chasing performance and then buying high and selling low. "When funds go on a streak of high returns, investors tend to get in right before the peak; then, when the hot streak goes cold, too many shareholders bail out at the bottom," explains Jason Zweig.&lt;ref name="Zwieg"/&gt;

===Regret aversion===
A theory that says we anticipate regret if we make a choice that is wrong in hindsight, and take this anticipation into consideration when making decisions. Fear of regret can play a large role in dissuading or motivating someone to do something. In investing, the fear of regret can make us either risk averse, or alternatively, motivate us to take greater risks.

We tend to anticipate greater regret from action than from inaction. For example, we may fear missing out on gains if we rebalance out of stocks (action) and the market keeps going up more than we fear losses if we hold tight (inaction) and the market goes down. However, we may fear those same losses more than the potential gains when deciding to invest new money in the market (action).

Fear of regret may also cause us to act if we will later be faced with the consequences of our inaction, such as being left out while our friend makes money on a stock tip or learning that we would have won a lottery.

==Theory and background==
{{Quotation|Investing is not a science. It is a human activity that involves both emotional as well as rational behavior.|John Bogle|The Clash of the Cultures}}

===What is behavioral economics?===
Behavioral economics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.investopedia.com/behavioral-economics-4689799| title=Introduction to Behavioral Economics| publisher=Investopedia| accessdate=June 1, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; explores the emotions and biases that lead investors and consumers to sometimes make irrational economic decisions. It also studies why and how their behavior does not follow the predictions of standard economic models that assume people make rational choices about spending money to "maximize their total satisfaction."&lt;ref name="BogleheadsGuide"/&gt;

Many behavioral pitfalls are based on the finding that investors are risk averse. They dislike losses almost twice as much as they like comparable gains and may take on more risk hoping to avoid a loss than realize a gain. They may also abandon a sound strategy under the stress of a loss. Consider this carefully this when choosing your all-important asset allocation.

You may not sense risk-aversion bias when an asset allocation is made. It will, however, present itself during a market downturn or crash, when the emotional stress of a loss can cause panic. If your asset allocation was not properly based on your risk tolerance, your are likely to abandon the market and sell low.

===History===
Many ideas now accepted in behavioral economics can be traced back to groundbreaking contributions by mathematician Daniel Bernoulli, ''New Theory on the Measurement of Risk'' (1738),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=[Exposition of a New Theory on the Measurement of Risk]| date=1954| journal=Econometrica | volume=22 |pages=23–36| url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/1909829| doi=10.2307/1909829| accessdate=June 1, 2023}} English translation of Bernoulli, D., "Specimen Theoriae Novae de Mensura Sortis", (1738).&lt;/ref&gt; and philosopher Adam Smith, ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments'' (1759).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.ibiblio.org/ml/libri/s/SmithA_MoralSentiments_p.pdf| title=The Theory of Moral Sentiments| author=Adam Smith| accessdate=June 1, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; The key to these early works was their elements of psychology, but psychology was subsequently rejected by economists at the turn of the 20th century because they thought it provided too unsteady a foundation for economics.

In the second half of the 20th century, several researchers challenged the dismissal of psychology as a branch of economics.

===Prospect theory===
The final step in the advancement of behavioral economics as a significant field of economic research is often thought to have started with the work of psychologists [[Daniel Kahneman]] and Amos Tversky. They began their joint work in 1969, and the excellent working relationship ultimately led to the publishing of their seminal paper, ''Prospect Theory'', ten years later.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, (1979).

Obtained from [https://web.archive.org/web/20180517164337/https://www.princeton.edu/~kahneman/publications.html Daniel Kahneman's Publications], Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs, Princeton University.&lt;/ref&gt; Prospect theory offers a framework for how people frame economic outcomes as gains and losses and how this framing affects people's economic decisions and choices. Amos Tversky died in 1996. Daniel Kahneman received the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences for his work in 2002.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;For more, see [https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/2002/ NobelPrize.org]:

===Prospect theory and the individual investor===
{{Quotation|The investor’s chief problem - and even his worst enemy - is likely to be himself.|Ben Graham}} 

Prospect theory is important because it brings awareness to the common and costly pitfalls that frequently trip up investors. There are two ways pitfalls arise: heuristics and cognitive biases.

Heuristics are mental shortcuts people use for processing complex information. The process falls back on experience by trial and error, rule of thumb, or common sense. While heuristics provide a fast decision, often those decisions are faulty when applied to investing. Anchoring is a heuristic.

Cognitive bias describes inherent thinking errors that humans make in processing information. When investors act on a bias, they do not explore the full issue and can be ignorant of evidence that contradicts their initial opinions. Confirmation bias is an example of cognitive bias.&lt;ref name="confirm" /&gt;

Never use leverage when saving towards retirement. The risk ''level'' inherent in leverage is excessive, and can jeopardize your retirement savings.}}

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' (sometimes referred to as '''gearing''') is borrowing someone else's money to increase your returns. For example, a home mortgage uses leverage because you borrow money to acquire an asset. There are many other examples, such as:

*Stock [[Margin | margin account]]
*Hedge fund borrowing against its own investments
*[[Derivative]] security like an [[options | option]] or swap
*Taking out a cash advance on a credit card and investing the advance

It is called ''leverage'' because the effect is to increase both profits and losses, much like a lever in the real world. [[wikipedia:Leverage (finance)|Financial leverage]] allows a smaller amount of money to participate in and own profits usually possible only with a larger amount of money. You can think of some [[options]] as leveraged investments because they magnify the returns of their underlying securities. Any time you borrow to invest you are leveraging your investment.

Leverage allows you to magnify the risk and reward to be more than 100% of the investment. However, you can lose more than the original investment [[#Risk | (see below)]]. 

''Note:'' If you purchase a [[futures | futures contract]] or an [[options | option contract]] you have not purchased the equity itself, you have purchased a [[derivative]] contract on the underlying asset. Buying a [[derivative]] contract has more in common with borrowing the money (from your broker or otherwise) than it does with simply buying the equity without borrowing.

Leverage is calculated as the ratio of the amount you invest (your share of the investment, the "debt") to the amount of the investment (the total invested, the "equity). Examples of leverage are shown [[#Examples of Leveraging | below]].

==Risk==
When you use leverage, you increase your risk as well as your reward. Followers of the [[Bogleheads Investment Philosophy | Bogleheads investment philosophy]] are strongly discouraged against the use of leverage. The concern is with ''controlling'' risk rather than ''applying strategies'' to increase it. You should never use leverage when saving towards retirement, as the ''level'' of risk inherent in it is excessive, and can jeopardize your retirement savings.

You should only leverage investments if you are willing to accept the possibility that you could lose ''all'' of your original investment. Because you have to repay the lender of the borrowed money, it is quite probable that you will end up ''owing'' additional funds. Consequences of significant losses can be severe and are not to be taken lightly. Consider that some forum members associate leverage akin to risks taken by gambling.&lt;ref&gt;{{forum link| p=494968| title=What is "Leverage"?}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{forum link| p=713385| title=Time magazine: Why young people should buy stocks on margin}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Leverage is not always bad. Bank use leverage to run their business. For individual investors, there may be some cases where it makes sense. However, you must ''always'' have an exit strategy.

==Forms of leverage (investing)==
If you are always 100% correct, leverage can be profitable. However, each form of leverage has drawbacks. Consider the following examples:

'''[[Margin]]:''' You borrow money from your broker, but there is interest costs, and you can lose as if you had the larger value invested. For example, you have $25K in your account and "borrow" $25K. In a
sell-off you are losing money as if $50K is invested but you only have $25K.

Borrowing capital via a margin account incurs interest expenses. In order for a leveraged portfolio to be profitable, the portfolio's returns over the target period must exceed the amount of interest paid to the lender to finance the loaned funds.

Additionally, [[Margin#Margin Accounts | margin accounts]] have minimum margin (equity) requirements (usually 30% of the total value of the portfolio's assets, if the portfolio consists entirely of long stock positions). If the account's equity drops below the minimum requirement, you face a margin call, meaning that you have to liquidate assets or add funds to the account until the equity ratio reaches the minimum requirement.

Margin requirements change according to the time of day: regular trading hours versus overnight margin (usually 2x regular trading hours).

A margin call also gives the broker the right to liquidate any or all of your positions, at will and without your approval, until the margin requirement is met. Therefore, unless you monitor the account closely, there may be a substantial risk that positions will be liquidated unintentionally, and so realizing unexpected capital gains or losses.

Brokers who offer margin accounts must inform investors of their margin requirements and margin rates, and provide them with standardized materials regarding the risks of buying on margin.

'''[[Options]]:''' You can buy a 40 Call for $300. If the stock goes up it is as if you own $4000 worth of stock. However you have to be correct on your call over a short time-frame. You pay broker
fees as well as time and volatility premiums.

'''[[Futures]]:''' You must be correct in your call. You can lose more money than you have invested and there are broker/margin fees.

'''2X, 3X [[Exchange-traded funds]]''': The cheapest/simplest alternative. If you are wrong, the position will move against you at two to three times the normal rate. These also have "tracking error" over longer time-frames, and work best in the short-term.

==Examples of leveraging==
Consider the following two examples. The first example uses a method of borrowing commonly used by stock traders. The second example is hypothetical and intended to show the increased level of risk associated with high amounts of leverage.

===Borrowing on margin===
Margin borrowing lets you leverage securities you already own to purchase additional securities. With leveraging, you can potentially realize greater investment returns (or greater investment losses).

Suppose you purchase $10,000 of stock with $10,000 cash. The stock sells for $11,000 and you have a profit of 10% ($1,000).

Now, suppose you only had $5,000 of cash. You then borrow $5,000 on margin and sell the stock for $11,000. After paying back the $5,000 borrowed, you end up with a profit of 20% ($1,000).

Instead of gaining $1,000, the stock now loses $1,000. You are left with $4,000 and a loss of 20% ($1,000).

Leverage has not only magnified your gain from 10% to 20%, it magnified your loss as well. Your risk has doubled (leverage factor of 2x). Fees, commissions, interest, and taxes not included.

===Cavorite refining corporation===
Refer to the table below. Suppose you have $50,000 to invest and are absolutely sure that Cavorite Refining Corporation will go from $50 to $60, so you invest everything at $50/share.

(1) Cavorite Refining increases to $60/share and you receive a profit of $10,000. Skip column (2) for now.

(3) Instead of being satisfied with a $10,000 profit, you buy on emotion (contrary to the advice in [[The Twelve Pillars of Wisdom]]) and borrow an additional $450,000 which results in an investment of $500,000. A potential profit of $100,000 is waiting for you. This is a leverage of 10x ($500,000 / $50,000).

However... Just before you sell, the supply of Cavorite unexpectedly disappears off the face of the earth. There is nothing left to refine and Cavorite Refining's stock drops to $45/share while it restructures its business.

(4) A sale price of $45/share is enough to payback your lender, but that includes your $50,000. You have been wiped out.

(5) Cavorite Refining learns that its primary customer, Cavorite Sphere Manufacturing, switches to another supplier and the stock drops to $40/share. Not only have you lost your original investment, but you must find additional cash to pay your lender.

|}

As shown in this example, the effects of leverage can be dramatic. Without leverage, the losses experienced are limited to the amount of your investment. While a 20% drop is significant (2), it is still a much less significant impact than if leverage was used.

The leverage factor can be seen by comparing the "Stock change %" to the "Net profit or loss %". Without leverage, they are the same. With leverage, the change in profit or loss is magnified by 10x. This is why it is called a "lever".

==Special caution about leveraged ETFs==
{{Main|Inverse and leveraged ETFs}}
There are leveraged ETFs that have goals like this:
{{blockquote|ProShares Ultra S&amp;P500 seeks daily investment results, before fees and expenses, that correspond to two times (2x) the daily performance of the S&amp;P 500.}}
These do not do what some investors think. The word "daily" is key; it is not a detail. For example, in a 2X leveraged ETF will not give you long-term results that are in any way comparable to doubling the results of an S&amp;P index fund.

      <text bytes="5692" sha1="f5su4sdn5oltgfcv02b3c4d8zth5aq0" xml:space="preserve">As shown in [[Risk and return: an introduction]], '''risk''' is a complex topic. But when it comes to ''investing,'' risk can be summarized as follows:
:''Risk and return are inseparable. Higher returns can &lt;u&gt;only&lt;/u&gt; be achieved by taking more risk. There is no free lunch.

Exceptions are few and far between. The example below uses historical data to demonstrate that, in general, owning stocks is riskier (has more variation in returns) than bonds. You can mitigate (reduce) this risk by diversifying your portfolio.

== Variation of returns ==
As Figure 1 indicates, the return on bonds is less certain than the return on cash ([[Treasury bills]]), and the return on stocks is less certain than the return on bonds. Thus, bonds are considered riskier than cash, and stocks are considered riskier than bonds. However, as the risk increases, the average return also increases.

[[File:Range of Annual Returns.jpg|451px|thumb|left|Figure 1. Risk vs. Return: 1928 - 2011&lt;ref name="NYU"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/histretSP.html| title=Annual Returns on Stock, T.Bonds and T.Bills: 1928 - Current| publisher=Damodaran Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
{{clear}}
Now, refer to Figure 2, which is Figure 1 but from a different perspective.

As stated in [[Risk and return: an introduction]], ''uncertainty'' includes both gain ''and'' loss. Consideration must be given not only for the expected return (''average''), but also for the ''range'' of variation.

Figure 2 shows this graphically. When the return is higher than planned, a windfall is experienced. A lower return than planned is a shortfall.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Shortfall risk is normally associated with long-term returns and defined in [[Risk and return: an introduction]]. Windfall is not a defined risk, but is used to describe an unexpected increase (a "surprise" event).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Range of Annual Returns2.jpg|451px|thumb|left|Figure 2. Risk vs. Return for Three Asset Classes: 1928 - 2011&lt;ref name="NYU" /&gt;]]
{{clear}}

==Portfolio diversification==
Now, combine those same assets into portfolios. Refer to Figure 3.&lt;ref group = "note"&gt;
Table 1 shows the portfolio breakdown. The file used to create this table and all the figures in this article can be downloaded from Google Docs: [https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B8VSNcUR-B6Idk9welFiMDhRX3UybzZxdjdseDVwdw Risk - Historical Performance of Bonds and Stocks.xlsx]

|}
The Excel file contains additional metrics, including the use of [[wikipedia:Value at risk | Value at risk]] to determine the length of the shortfall arrows.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Treasury bonds and bills have been combined into a single category called "bonds." This is done intentionally, as [[Asset class | asset classes]] which contain [[Bond basics | bonds]] and [[Treasury bill | bills]] are commonly grouped together as [[Fixed income | ''fixed income'']].

Going from left to right, the portfolio progresses from (20% stocks / 80% bonds) to (80% stocks / 20% bonds). Similar to Figure 2, the least variation and lowest return is a portfolio which contains mostly bonds. The highest variation and highest return is a portfolio containing mostly stocks.

This demonstrates that you can reduce your portfolio risk by adding bonds, but this may result in a lower return. Alternatively, you can increase your return by adding stocks, at an increased risk of loss.

Figure 3 shows a ''hypothetical'' portfolio of assets held from 1928 - 2011 and should not be compared with an actual portfolio. The arrow lengths are used to show relative variation only. Also, do ''not'' assume that the returns vary evenly (linearly) across the portfolio percentages.&lt;ref group="note"&gt; It is an effect of this specific hypothetical portfolio held for 83 years; one which cannot be reproduced in the real world.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text bytes="78927" sha1="d9hyl65jbu5mvubdcyvkawpi0oq2ocj" xml:space="preserve">The relationship between '''risk''' and '''return''' is a fundamental concept in finance theory, and is one of the most important concepts for investors to understand. A widely used definition of investment risk, both in theory and practice, is the uncertainty that an investment will earn its expected rate of return.&lt;ref&gt;Reilly (1994), p.11&lt;/ref&gt; Finance literature uses "return" and "rate of return" interchangeably.

A rational investor will not take more risk without expecting a higher return. Since the early 1950s, an enormous amount of theoretical and empirical research has characterized and quantified the relationship between risk and return.

[[Harry M. Markowitz|Harry Markowitz]] initially developed ''Portfolio Theory'' in the early 1950s. This was the first serious theoretical attempt to quantify the relationship between risk and return. Portfolio Theory often is referred to as ''Modern Portfolio Theory'' or MPT. Portfolio theory characterizes risk as the uncertainty of returns, and uses standard statistical techniques to quantify the relationship between risk and return. These techniques include statistical measures such as ''variance'' and [[standard deviation]] to quantify the uncertainty of returns.

"Uncertainty of returns" includes not only the possibility of loss, but also the possibility of ''positive surprises'' relative to expectations. Because investors typically are more concerned about negative surprises than positive surprises, some theoretical work considers only negative deviations relative to expectations. However, risk as the uncertainty of returns, including positive as well as negative deviations from expectations, is the main risk model used in investing.

[[William F. Sharpe|William Sharpe]] and others extended portfolio theory to develop asset valuation models, such as the [[CAPM - Capital Asset Pricing Model | Capital Asset Pricing Model]], or CAPM. CAPM introduced the idea of combining a risk-free asset with a portfolio of risky assets to construct a complete portfolio that resulted in an efficient trade-off between risk and return. It also gave a more straightforward way to quantify the risk of individual assets, by comparing their returns with the return of a broad market portfolio. CAPM's other important contribution was to clarify the distinction between ''systematic risk'' inherent in investing in risky assets, which cannot be eliminated, and ''unsystematic risk'' specific to individual firms, which diversification can eliminate.

[[Eugene F. Fama|Eugene Fama]], [[Kenneth R. French|Kenneth French]], and others added work to develop more sophisticated models to evaluate risk and return. Although CAPM uses a single "factor" to characterize risk, Fama and French showed that a multifactor model better explains historical returns. Instead of comparing the returns of an asset or portfolio of assets only to a broad market portfolio, they also compared them to portfolios of small-cap stocks and value stocks (technically small minus big or SmB, and high book value minus low book value or HmL). This is the ''Fama-French three-factor model''.

The finance theory in this article outlines some of the theoretical foundations for asset allocation and investing in index mutual funds. It evaluates expected rates of return for various asset classes and compares them to the risk of the asset classes. Investor goals and [[risk tolerance]] determine the trade-off between the expected return and risk of the portfolio. The portfolio combines various lower-risk and higher-risk asset classes to achieve an efficient risk-return trade-off.

Determining risk tolerance is a critical step in designing a portfolio. Several approaches can help investors to assess their risk tolerance.

Both shorter-term risk and longer-term risk are characterized by the uncertainty of returns. Shorter-term risk typically is characterized by the uncertainty of shorter-term returns; for example, monthly or annual returns. Longer-term risk is better characterized by the uncertainty of the cumulative portfolio value (terminal wealth) after many years of investing.

==Risk as the uncertainty of returns==

The rate of return earned on an investment in a 30-day [[Treasury bill]] (T-Bill) or short-term [[Certificate of Deposit]] (CD) has high certainty. T-Bills and CDs are among the investments referred to collectively as [[Money Markets|money market]] securities.&lt;ref&gt;Bodie, Kane, Marcus, 2008, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; A money market fund provides a convenient way for an investor to own money market securities. The short-term return on deposits in federally-insured bank or credit union accounts is also highly certain (the term ''cash'' often is used to refer to money market securities and money in deposit accounts; [[Vanguard]] refers to these types of assets as ''short-term reserves'').

The returns earned by T-Bills, CDs and money market funds fall into a relatively narrow range over longer time periods as well.

[[File:Return Dispersion - T-Bills - T-Bonds - Stocks.jpg|thumb|right|351px|Figure 1. Risk vs. Return: 1928 - 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/histretSP.html| title=Annual Returns on Stock, T.Bonds and T.Bills: 1928 - Current| publisher=Damodaran Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The top chart in Figure 1 is a [[Wikipedia:histogram|histogram]] showing the frequency distribution of returns for 3-month T-Bills from 1928 through 2011. The ''height'' of each bar represents the ''number of years'' in which annual returns have fallen within a given 5% range or "bin" (that is, 0% to 5%, 5% to 10%, etc.). The tallest bar shows that annual returns have been between 0% and 5% in 59 years. Returns have been between 5% and 10% in 22 years (second tallest bar), and between 10% and 15% in three years (shortest bar). 

The return on [[Bond basics|bonds]] is less certain than the return on money market securities, so bonds are considered riskier than money market securities (cash). The middle chart in Figure 1 shows the frequency distribution of annual returns for 10-Year Treasury Bonds from 1928 through 2011 (the same vertical scale for number of years is used in all charts in Figure 1, and the same 5% bins are used on the horizontal axes). Notice that the range of returns is larger, from about -11% to +33%, and that the number of years in which returns fall within any given 5% bin is generally smaller. In other words, the shape of the return distribution is more "spread out" and flatter. The shape of the return distribution represents the ''dispersion of returns'', also referred to as the ''deviation of returns''.

The return on [[Stock basics|stocks]] is more uncertain than the return on bonds, so stocks are considered riskier than bonds. The bottom chart in Figure 1 shows the frequency distribution of annual returns on the stocks of large US companies (the S&amp;P 500) from 1928 through 2011. Note the much larger dispersion of returns; the shape of the distribution is much flatter and more spread out, with returns ranging from about -44% to +53%, and none of the 5% bins including returns for more than 10 years (by contrast, recall that one 5% bin included the T-bill returns for 59 years).

''Standard deviation'' is a measure commonly used to quantify the deviation (or dispersion) of returns. The standard deviation is listed for each chart in Figure 1. The standard deviation increases as the dispersion of returns increases (that is, as the shape of the distribution becomes flatter and more spread out). Standard deviation will be defined in more detail in subsequent sections.

==Risk as the possibility of loss==

The definition of risk as the uncertainty of investment return does not distinguish between loss and gain. Typically, individual investors think of risk as the possibility that their investments could lose money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Rick Ferri| author-link=Rick Ferri| title=All About Asset Allocation| date=2006| page=23| publisher=McGraw-Hill| isbn=978-0071429580}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are likely to be quite happy with an investment return that is greater than expected (a "positive surprise"). However, because risky assets generate positive surprises as well as negative surprises, defining risk as the ''uncertainty'' of the return seems reasonable. Mor uncertainty makes it more likely that the investment will generate gains as well as losses. 

Variance and standard deviation, discussed in detail in subsequent sections, quantify the negative ''and positive'' deviation of returns around the average return (the terms ''average return'', ''mean return'', and ''expected return'' are used interchangeably, as are the terms ''deviation of returns'' and ''dispersion of returns''). Some theoretical portfolio work uses measures that consider only risk of loss; semivariance, which considers only deviations below the average, is one example.

However, because deviation of returns is symmetrical, variance provides as good an indicator of downside risk as semivariance. If returns are symmetrical, the the probabilities and magnitudes of positive and negative surprises are roughly the same. It is reasonable to assume a symmetrical distribution of returns for a well diversified portfolio, and most assets have returns that are reasonably symmetrical.&lt;ref&gt;Elton et al, 2003, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore in portfolio theory, as well as in practice, variance and standard deviation are the most commonly used measures of dispersion of returns. In other words, even though investors may be primarily concerned with negative surprises, investment risk can be adequately estimated with measures that include both positive and negative surprises.

A major concern of investors is that their investment portfolios will not generate returns sufficient to meet their goals. This is "shortfall risk", and deserves serious consideration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author1=Zvi Bodie| author2=Paula H. Hogan| url=https://www.aaii.com/features/jrnl200506p16.pdf| title=For Long-Term Investors, the Focus Should Be on Risk| publisher=AAII Journal| accessdate=October 17, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, using uncertainty of returns can be a valid approach in estimating the riskiness of long-term returns as well as short-term returns, as long as it uses the appropriate variance or standard deviation measures. 

For long-term returns, it is more appropriate to estimate the ''dispersion of accumulated wealth'' (also referred to as ''terminal wealth dispersion'') rather than the deviation of returns over relatively short time periods, such as annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author1=Gary Smith| author2=Donald Gould| url=http://economics-files.pomona.edu/GarySmith/shortfallRisk.pdf| title=Measuring and Controlling Shortfall Risk in Retirement| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190118052301/http://economics-files.pomona.edu/GarySmith/shortfallRisk.pdf| archive-date=January 18, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because relatively small differences in ''annualized'' returns can make large differences in ''cumulative'' returns over periods of many years.&lt;ref&gt;Bodie, Kane, Marcus, 2008, p. 180&lt;/ref&gt; Long-term dispersion of returns accounts for the ''magnitude'' as well as the ''probability'' of possible losses.

=="Risk free" assets==
[[File:Annual US Treasury Bill Yield and Inflation Rate.jpg|thumb|right|351px|Figure 2. Annualized T-Bill yield and inflation rate (1928 - 2011)&lt;ref group="note"&gt;T-bill data source comes from [http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/histretSP.html Annual Returns on Stock, T.Bonds and T.Bills: 1928 - Current], Damodaran Online. Inflation data comes from [https://www.minneapolisfed.org/community/teaching-aids/cpi-calculator-information/consumer-price-index-and-inflation-rates-1913 Consumer Price Index 1913 -, Minnesota Federal Reserve].{{dead link}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Money market securities are often referred to as ''risk-free assets'', especially the shorter-maturity securities such as 30-day T-Bills. This is because the short-term return is known with relative certainty at the time the investment is made. There is absolute certainty in the nominal return of a T-Bill (assuming the U.S. government does not default on its obligations), and it is unlikely that unexpected inflation will have significant impact on the real return over a short time period. 

Over longer time periods, even money market securities have some risk. This is because the effect of unexpected [[Consumer price index|inflation]] on returns is uncertain over longer time periods. Although money market security rates usually respond relatively quickly to changes in inflation, this is not always the case. Figure 2 illustrates the longer-term uncertainty of real returns on 90-day T-Bills. The relative ''certainty'' of return does not mean that the ''real'' return necessarily is ''positive''. It may be known with certainty that a 90-day T-Bill will earn a ''nominal'' annualized return of 1% over its 90-day term (that is, if held to maturity). However if inflation over the 90-day term is expected to be 3% annualized, the relatively certain, expected ''real'' return is -2% annualized.

Uncertainty in ''real'' returns can be eliminated by investing in inflation-indexed securities, such as [[Treasury Inflation Protected Securities]] ([[TIPS]]) and [[I Savings Bonds|Series I Savings Bonds]] ([[I Bonds]]), and holding them to maturity. Of course in return for this reduction in uncertainty, investors must accept lower expected returns. Marketable inflation-indexed securities also have other risks, such as interest rate risk (that is, prices decline when interest rates rise) and liquidity risk, as in late 2008 (September 12 - October 31) when the Vanguard Inflation-Protected Securities fund declined by almost 14%. During this same time period other U.S. treasury securities increased in value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author1=John Y. Campbell| author2=Robert J. Schiller| author3=Luis M.

In reality, whether or not an asset is risk free depends on the context of the investment; that is, the purpose and time horizon of the investment. For example, to meet a nominal liability at a specified future date, a zero-coupon US government bond maturing on that date is essentially risk free. 

Nevertheless, short-term T-bills usually are considered to be risk-free assets in portfolio theory, and in practice investors treat a broader range of money market securities as risk free.&lt;ref&gt;Bodie, Kane, Marcus, 1996, p. 173&lt;/ref&gt;

==Risk aversion and risk premiums==

Why would an investor invest in a risky asset class such as stocks rather than in a relatively risk-free asset such as T-bills? If the investor is not simply gambling, there must be some financial incentive, such as the expectation of a higher rate of return. The conclusion is that an investment in a risky asset depends on the investor's expectation of a higher rate of return as well as their level of ''risk aversion''.&lt;ref&gt;Bodie, Kane, Marcus, 2008, p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;

Rational investors are risk averse. That is, given the same expected return, they will choose the investment for which that return is more certain.&lt;ref&gt;Reilly, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, investors demand a higher expected return for riskier assets. A higher ''expected'' return does not guarantee a higher ''realized'' return. Because by definition returns on risky assets are uncertain, an investment may not earn its expected return.

The amount by which a risky asset is expected to provide a higher rate of return than the ''risk-free rate'' is the asset's ''risk premium'' (the risk-free rate is the rate of return on a risk-free asset, such as a T-bill). If the risk premium of stocks is zero, a ''rational'', risk-averse investor would have no incentive to invest in them. On the other hand, a gambler might "invest" in something with a zero or even negative risk premium for entertainment value, or in the irrational expectation of hitting a jackpot.

Although the charts in Figure 1 show historical (realized) returns rather than expected (future) returns, they are useful to demonstrate the relationship between risk and return, and the risk premiums of bonds and stocks relative to the relatively risk-free returns on T-bills. The mean (average) annual return increases as the dispersion of returns (uncertainty or risk) increases. 

Assuming an investor selects an investment portfolio based on expected return and risk, the equation below is used to quantify the relationship between risk premium, risk aversion, A, and risk σ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, where the risk premium is the expected return, E(r), of the risky investment minus the risk-free rate, r&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{Risk} \operatorname{Premium} = \operatorname{E}(r) - r_f = \frac12 A \sigma^2&lt;/math&gt;

In this equation risk is measured by variance, σ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, which quantifies the dispersion of an investment's returns. Variance is discussed in depth in another section. The factor of &lt;span style="font-size:100%"&gt;''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;/span&gt; is a scaling factor used by convention, and the use of this equation requires expressing all returns as decimals rather than percentages.

This equation indicates that the risk premium demanded by investors will be higher for individual investors with greater risk aversion, A, and for investments with higher risk, σ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

Studies have shown that investors' risk aversion probably is in the range of 2-4.&lt;ref&gt;Bodie, Kane, Marcus, 2008, p. 124&lt;/ref&gt; This implies that for an increase of portfolio variance of 0.01, investors will require a risk premium that is higher by 0.01-0.02 (1%-2%).

==Measuring risk: historical returns==
Historical returns often are used as a starting point in estimating expected returns and uncertainty of returns (risk).&lt;ref&gt;Ilmanen, 2011, p.7&lt;/ref&gt; Although evaluating historical returns may not enable an accurate or comprehensive estimation of risk, evaluating the dispersion of historical returns provides a convenient way to develop an understanding of commonly used risk measures.

The risk of an investment is related to the uncertainty of its investment return. This was illustrated graphically in Figure 1, which showed that dispersion of returns is a way to characterize the riskiness of an investment. Many investors like to summarize return and risk with numbers that quantify the average return and the dispersion of returns around the average.&lt;ref&gt;Bodie, Kane, Marcus, 2008, p.121&lt;/ref&gt; This facilitates comparing the return and risk of different investments.&lt;ref&gt;Reilly, p.14&lt;/ref&gt; 

Calculating the average of a set of historical annual returns is straightforward: simply add the annual returns and divide by the number of annual returns. The technical term for this type of average is the ''arithmetic mean'', usually referred to simply as the ''mean''. Statisticians use the term ''expected value'' to refer to the mean. In finance theory the term ''expected value of the return'', or just ''expected return'' is commonly used in referring to the average of a set of returns.&lt;ref&gt;Elton et al (2003), p.45&lt;/ref&gt;

What about calculating a number to quantify the uncertainty or dispersion of returns? Basic statistics and probability theory provide two measures to quantify the dispersion of a set of numbers: ''variance'' and ''standard deviation''. Starting in the early 1950s, finance academics began using these statistical measures to quantify risk.&lt;ref&gt;Markowitz, Harry (March 1952). [http://www.math.ust.hk/~maykwok/courses/ma362/07F/markowitz_JF.pdf "Portfolio Selection"]. ''The Journal of Finance'' 7 (1): 77-91. Retrieved April 12, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historical returns are commonly used as a starting point in evaluating the relative riskiness of different assets. A subset of the historical data shown graphically in Figure 1 provides a simple example to begin developing an understanding of standard deviation as a measure of risk.

Consider the S&amp;P 500 stock returns for 2008-2011: 

*2008: -36.55%
*2009: +25.94%
*2010: +14.82%
*2011: +2.07%

The mean, or expected value, E(r), of this set of returns is calculated below (for simplicity, the percent signs are dropped):

: &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{E}(r) = \frac{-36.55 + 25.94 + 14.82 + 2.07}{4} = 1.57 &lt;/math&gt;

The expected value of the annual return is 1.57%.

An alternate way to calculate expected value is to multiply each value by the probability of that value occurring, then sum the results. This formulation will be useful when calculating the expected value of estimated future returns. When evaluating historical returns, each return is considered to have equal probability, so the calculation using this method is:

: &lt;math&gt;
 \operatorname{E}(r) = \frac 14(-36.55)+\frac{1}{4}(25.94)+\frac{1}{4}(14.82) + \frac{1}{4}(2.07) = 1.57
 &lt;/math&gt;

The average of the annual returns is useful information, but it does not indicate anything about the dispersion of returns, that is, how the returns are distributed around the mean return.

It is intuitive that a useful measure of dispersion of returns around the average return would involve calculating the differences (deviations) between the individual returns and the average return, and perhaps averaging these deviations. For example the deviation for the 2009 return is 25.94 - 1.57 = 24.37, whereas the deviation for the much smaller 2011 return is only 2.07 - 1.57 = 0.50.

The problem with this is that there will be both positive and negative deviations that will tend to cancel each other out, resulting in a misleading value that understates the dispersion of returns around the mean; in fact, the average of the deviations from the mean will always be zero.&lt;ref&gt;Bodie, Kane, Marcus, 2008, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt; This can be verified by calculating the average of the deviations from the mean for all four years in the example. Therefore, this value indicates nothing about dispersion.

This problem is resolved by ''squaring'' the deviations from the mean (which results in all positive numbers), then calculating the average of the squared deviations. The term ''variance'' is used to describe the average of the squared deviations. Here is the calculation of the variance of the annual returns using the returns from 2008-2011:

: &lt;math&gt;
 \operatorname{Var}(r) = \sigma^2 = \frac{ (-36.55-1.57)^2+(25.94-1.57)^2+(14.82 - 1.57)^2+(2.07-1.57)^2 } {4} = 556
 &lt;/math&gt;

The symbol &amp;sigma;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; commonly represents variance, so Var(r) = &amp;sigma;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 556.

This formula can be generalized as:

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Var}(r) = \sigma^2 = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n (r_i - \operatorname{E}(r))^2&lt;/math&gt;

(When calculating the variance of a ''sample'' of the full population of values (as in the example here), statisticians often substitute &lt;span style="font-size:100%"&gt;''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;(n-1)&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;/span&gt; for &lt;span style="font-size:100%"&gt;''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;/span&gt; in the above formula. There are arguments for and against this.&lt;ref&gt;Elton et al (2003), p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; In this article this substitution will not be made.)

To get a value with the same units as the rate of return (percent), the square root of the variance is calculated, resulting in the ''standard deviation'' of the annual returns:

: &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{SD}(r) = \sigma = \sqrt{556} = 23.6 &lt;/math&gt;

The symbol &amp;sigma; commonly represents standard deviation, so SD(r) = &amp;sigma; = 23.6 pp (technically, the units of the standard deviation of returns are percentage points (pp), but standard deviation of returns often is displayed using the % symbol, for example, 23.6%).

The resulting value of 23.6 pp (or 23.6%) for the standard deviation seems somewhat reasonable as an indicator of the dispersion of returns around the mean value of 1.57%, considering that the range of values is between -36.55% and +25.94%.

Standard deviation has some standard statistical interpretations for a large number of values with a normal distribution (the ubiquitous bell curve). For example, about 68% of all values fall within +/- one standard deviation, and about 95% of all values fall within +/- two standard deviations. 

There are too few values in our simple example for these statistical attributes to apply, but consider the 84 annual returns for 10-Year treasury bonds represented in the second chart in Figure 1.

First notice that the data somewhat resembles the bell-shape curve characteristic of a normal distribution. The mean value of the 84 annual returns for 10-Year treasury bonds is about 5%, and the standard deviation is about 8% (pp). Two standard deviations is about 2 x 8 = 16, so we expect most of the annual returns to fall within the range of about 5% +/- 16 pp or between about -11% and +21%. From the chart, this looks about right.

For the third chart in Figure 1, representing 84 annual returns for the stocks in the S&amp;P 500, the mean is about 11% and the standard deviation is about 20%, so we expect most values to fall within a range of about 11% +/- 40 pp, or between about -29% and + 51%. Again, this looks about right.

Rather than calculating the standard deviation of annual returns, the annualized standard deviation of ''monthly'' returns sometimes is used to characterize dispersion of returns. For example, Morningstar calculates the standard deviation of monthly returns over various time periods of one year or more (for example, three years, five years, and so on), then multiplies by the square root of twelve to generate an estimate of the annualized standard deviation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| publisher=Morningstar| date=2005| url=http://corporate.morningstar.com/us/documents/MethodologyDocuments/MethodologyPapers/StandardDeviationSharpeRatio_Definition.pdf| title=Standard Deviation and Sharpe Ratio Methodology| accessdate=August 10, 2012}}{{dead link}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Expected return==

Although in finance theory, ''expected return'' is a synonym for the average of a set of returns, in investing, ''expected return'' more often refers to ''future'' returns than to ''historical'' returns. From here on this will be the context in which the term is used. In this context, ''expected return'' can be thought of informally as the return investors expect to receive on an investment. Indeed, the term often is used this way by authors of investment books (as seems to be the case, for example, in ''Expected Returns'' by Ilmanen.&lt;ref&gt;Ilmanen, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;) However, in investment theory ''expected return'' has a more precise definition.

An investment's expected return, &lt;span style="font-size:100%"&gt;E(''r'')&lt;/span&gt;, is calculated as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Bodie, Kane, Marcus, 2008, p. 112&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reilly, pp. 11-13&lt;/ref&gt;

# Various economic scenarios, &lt;span style="font-size:100%"&gt;''s''&lt;/span&gt;, are defined.
# Estimates are developed for the probability, &lt;span style="font-size:100%"&gt;p(''s'')&lt;/span&gt;, of each scenario occurring and the return, &lt;span style="font-size:100%"&gt;r(''s'')&lt;/span&gt;, for that scenario. 
# The probability and return for each scenario are multiplied together: &lt;span style="font-size:100%"&gt;p(''s'')&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:100%"&gt;r(''s'')&lt;/span&gt;
# The results are summed across all scenarios: &lt;span style="font-size:100%"&gt;p(''s&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'')r(''s&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'') + p(''s&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'')r(''s&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'') + &amp;hellip; + p(''s&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'')r(''s&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'')&lt;/span&gt;

Or using summation notation:

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}(r) = \sum_{i=1}^n \operatorname{p}(s_i)\operatorname{r}(s_i)&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, expected return is the ''probability-weighted average of returns across all possible scenarios''.

First consider an investment in a 1-year T-Bill. Since the nominal return is unaffected by economic factors, the nominal return is certain; that is, the probability, &lt;span style="font-size:100%"&gt;p(''s'')&lt;/span&gt; = 1, and the return, &lt;span style="font-size:100%"&gt;r(''s'')&lt;/span&gt;, is the rate of return on the bill. If the rate of return is 1%, the expected nominal return is calculated as:

:&lt;math&gt; 
\operatorname{E}(r) = \operatorname{p}(s)\operatorname{r}(s) = (1.0)(0.1) = 0.01 = 1%
&lt;/math&gt;

As a slightly more complex, but still simple, scenario analysis, consider a one-year investment in a total stock market index fund, with three possible economic scenarios for the year: recession, normal growth, and strong growth. Assume the following estimates for the three scenarios:

:*Recession: probability &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{p}(s_1)=0.20&lt;/math&gt;, estimated return &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{r}(s_1)= -10%&lt;/math&gt;
:*Normal growth: probability &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{p}(s_2) = 0.60&lt;/math&gt;, estimated return &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{r}(s_2) = 5%&lt;/math&gt;
:*Strong growth: probability &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{p}(s_3) = 0.20&lt;/math&gt;, estimated return &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{r}(s_3) = 10%&lt;/math&gt;

With these scenario estimates, the expected return,&lt;span style="font-size:100%"&gt;E(''r'')&lt;/span&gt;, is calculated as:

:&lt;math&gt; 
\operatorname{E}(r) = \operatorname{p}(s_1)\operatorname{r}(s_1) + 
\operatorname{p}(s_2)\operatorname{r}(s_2) + 
\operatorname{p}(s_3)\operatorname{r}(s_3) 
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; 
\operatorname{E}(r) = (0.20)(-0.10)+(0.60)(0.05)+(0.20)(0.10) = 0.03 = 3%
&lt;/math&gt;

Notice that the expected return of 3% is not equal to the most probable return of 5%.

Extensive research has demonstrated that there are no good forecasters.&lt;ref&gt;Swedroe (2002), ''Rational Investing in Irrational Times'', pp. 191-200. Truman Talley Books, St. Martin's Press, New York &lt;/ref&gt; It follows that scenario analysis itself is fraught with uncertainty. To put it bluntly, expected returns are not directly observable; they can only be estimated.&lt;ref&gt;Ilmanen, p.32&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, financial academics and practitioners develop and publish their estimates of expected returns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Rick Ferri| author-link=Rick Ferri| url=http://www.portfoliosolutions.com/f-13.html| title=The Portfolio Solutions 30-Year Market Forecast For 2012| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121027031840/http://www.portfoliosolutions.com/the-portfolio-solutions-30-year-market-forecast-for-2012/| archive-date=October 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Various links to GMO's latest 7-year forecast can be found by searching for "GMO 7-Year Asset Class Forecasts (February 2012)".

A concept that will be useful in subsequent sections is the ''expected return of a portfolio'', which is simply the weighted average of the expected returns for the individual assets in the portfolio. This is expressed mathematically as:

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}(r_p) = \sum_{i=1}^n (w_i)\operatorname{E}(r_i)&lt;/math&gt;

where ''w&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the percent of the portfolio in asset ''i'', and E(''r&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'') is the expected return of asset ''i''.

==Measuring risk: estimated returns==

A previous section illustrated ''variance'' of returns using ''historical'' returns. The calculation of the variance of estimated ''future'' returns is similar, except that the probabilities of the returns are not equal, but are the probabilities assigned to various scenarios.

Variance of estimated future returns, Var(r), is calculated as follows:

# Subtract the expected return, E(r), from the estimated return, r(s), for the scenario: [r(s) - E(r)]
# Square the result: [r(s) - E(r)]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
# Multiply the result by the probability, p(s), of the scenario: p(s) x [r(s) - E(r)]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
# Sum the resulting values across all scenarios:

::&lt;math&gt; 
\operatorname{Var}(r) = \sigma^2 = 
\operatorname{p}(s_1)[\operatorname{r}(s_1) - \operatorname{E}(r)]^2 + 
\operatorname{p}(s_2)[\operatorname{r}(s_2) - \operatorname{E}(r)]^2 + \cdots +
\operatorname{p}(s_n)[\operatorname{r}(s_n) - \operatorname{E}(r)]^2
&lt;/math&gt;

Or using summation notation:

::&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Var}(r) = \sigma^2 = \sum_{i=1}^n \operatorname{p}(s_i)(r_i - \operatorname{E}(r))^2&lt;/math&gt;

To deepen the intuitive understanding of the calculation of variance of estimated returns, consider the purpose of each step in the calculation. 

# Step 1 yields a number that is larger for a scenario return that is further from the expected return. 
# Step 2 eliminates negative values, so that negative values do not offset positive values; that is, the measure should increase whether a scenario return is less than or greater than the expected return. 
# Step 3 gives a greater weight to a higher-probability scenario.
# Step 4 adds the individual, probability-weighted, squared differences to yield a single number.

The purposes of steps 1, 2 and 4 are basically the same as for the calculation of the variance of ''historical'' returns. Step 3 introduces ''probability weighting''. 

As with historical returns, the ''standard deviation'' of estimated returns is calculated as the ''square root of the variance'' of the estimated returns.

For the case of the nominal return on a 1-year T-Bill yielding 1%, the expected return, E(r), = 1%, and there is only one scenario, for which the nominal return is a certain (p(s) = 1). Therefore, the the variance is calculated as:

:&lt;math&gt; 
\operatorname{Var}(r) = \sigma^2 = 
\operatorname{p}(s_1)[\operatorname{r}(s_1) - \operatorname{E}(r)]^2
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{Var}(r) = \sigma^2 = (1.0)(0.01 - 0.01)^2 &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{Var}(r) = \sigma^2 = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

Since &lt;span style="font-size:100%"&gt;&amp;#8730;0 = 0&lt;/span&gt;, the standard deviation is 0 pp. Note the intuitive sense of this: a standard deviation of 0 indicates zero uncertainty in the return.

Recall the three-scenario case discussed earlier:

:*Recession: probability, p(s&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) = 0.20; estimated return, r(s&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) = -10%
:*Normal growth: probability, p(s&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) = 0.60; estimated return, r(s&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) = 5%
:*Strong growth: probability, p(s&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) = 0.20; estimated return, r(s&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) = 10%

The expected return, E(r), was calculated as 3%. The variance is calculated as:

:&lt;math&gt; 
\operatorname{Var}(r) = \sigma^2 = 
\operatorname{p}(s_1)[\operatorname{r}(s_1) - \operatorname{E}(r)]^2 + 
\operatorname{p}(s_2)[\operatorname{r}(s_2) - \operatorname{E}(r)]^2 +
\operatorname{p}(s_3)[\operatorname{r}(s_3) - \operatorname{E}(r)]^2
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\operatorname{Var}(r) = \sigma^2 = (0.20)(-0.10 - 0.03)^2 + (0.60)(0.05 - 0.03)^2 + (0.20)(0.10 - 0.03)^2
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\operatorname{Var}(r) = \sigma^2 = (0.20)(-0.13)^2 + (0.60)(0.02)^2 + (0.20)(0.07)^2 
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{Var}(r) = \sigma^2 = 0.0046 &lt;/math&gt;

And the standard deviation is:

:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{SD}(r) = \sigma = \sqrt{0.0046} &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{SD}(r) = \sigma = 0.07 = 7% &lt;/math&gt;

Although three samples is not enough to apply the statistical implications of standard deviation, two of the returns fall within E(r) +/- one standard deviation (3% +/- 7 pp), and all returns fall within E(r) +/- two standard deviations (3% +/- 14 pp). Again, standard deviation seems to provide a reasonable measure of the dispersion of returns (risk).

==Managing portfolio risk==

A ''portfolio'' is the investor's collection of financial assets, such as stocks, bonds and cash. Selecting investments to balance the tradeoff between risk and expected return is ''portfolio selection'', ''portfolio construction'', or ''portfolio optimization''. ''Portfolio Theory'' is the theoretical basis for portfolio selection.

Portfolio selection has two main techniques for managing the risk-return tradeoff: diversification, and asset allocation. Diversification means owning enough securities in different industries to reduce or eliminate firm-specific and industry-specific risks. Asset allocation involves building an efficient portfolio, using multiple asset classes (such as stocks, bonds, and cash), that gives an appropriate risk-return tradeoff based on the investor's risk tolerance.

Intuitively, portfolio risk is proportional to the amount of risky assets in the portfolio. A straightforward way to adjust the risk of the complete portfolio is to combine a portfolio of risky assets with a risk-free asset, for example combining a total stock market index fund (the risky portfolio) with T-bills or other money market securities (the risk-free asset). The risk of the complete portfolio will be proportional to the proportion of the risky portfolio included in the complete portfolio, and inversely proportional to the proportion of the risk-free asset. Of course portfolio theory posits that expected return also is proportional to portfolio risk.

Although less intuitive, investors can adjust the portfolio risk-return tradeoff by combining different risky assets in various proportions. For example, they can improve the risk-return tradeoff by selecting a risky portfolio that includes US stocks, non-US stocks, and bonds. A goal of portfolio selection is to find a combination of risky assets that optimizes the ratio of expected return to risk. The ratio of expected return to risk is considered a measure of ''portfolio efficiency''.

Classic portfolio selection consists of two steps:

# Determine an optimal combination of risky assets (the ''risky portfolio'').
# Construct the ''complete portfolio'' by combining the risky portfolio with a risk-free asset in proportions that achieve an appropriate ratio of expected return to risk, based on the investor's risk tolerance.

The resulting portfolio is an efficient portfolio, in that any other combination of risky and risk-free assets would have either a lower expected return for a given level of risk, or more risk for a given level of expected return. Of course since expected returns and risk are not observable, but can only be estimated, portfolio efficiency cannot be known with any great certainty. The most efficient portfolio based on historical returns is unlikely to be the most efficient portfolio going forward. Nevertheless, investors often use historical returns to help estimate appropriate proportions of different risky asset classes to include in a portfolio.

Because step 2 of the two-step process described above involves simpler theory, it will be covered first. 

===Portfolio of risky assets combined with a risk-free asset===
Risky assets include bonds as well as stocks, but for now assume that the risky portfolio is a total stock market index fund. As discussed in previous sections, there is no truly risk-free asset, but T-bills often are considered the risk-free asset in portfolio theory. The risk of T-bills and other money market securities is so much lower than the risk of stocks that this is a reasonable approach, especially for relatively short holding periods.

Both the ''expected return'' and the ''risk'' of a portfolio must be determined to evaluate the ''risk-return trade-off'' of combining a portfolio of risky assets with a risk free asset. The following steps develop an equation that relates the expected return of a such a portfolio to its risk, where risk is measured by the standard deviation of portfolio returns.

''Portfolio of risky assets combined with a risk-free asset: ''Expected return'' ''

The expected return of a portfolio of assets is the the weighted average of the expected returns of the individual assets:

:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{E}(r_p) = w_1 \operatorname{E}(r_1) + w_2 \operatorname{E}(r_2)
 + \cdots + w_n \operatorname{E}(r_n).
&lt;/math&gt;

This can be expressed more concisely using summation notation as:

:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{E}(r_p) = \sum_{i=1}^n w_i \operatorname{E}(r_i). &lt;/math&gt;

The ''weight'' of an asset in a portfolio refers to the fraction of the portfolio invested in that asset. For example, if ''w&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' = &lt;span style="font-size:100%"&gt;&amp;#188;&lt;/span&gt;, then one fourth of the portfolio is invested in asset ''1'' with expected return E(''r&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'').

For ''two assets'' this reduces to:

:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{E}(r_p) = w_1 \operatorname{E}(r_1) + w_2 \operatorname{E}(r_2) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{E}(r_p) = w_1 \operatorname{E}(r_1) + (1 - w_1) \operatorname{E}(r_2)&lt;/math&gt;

Let one asset be the risky portfolio consisting of a total stock market index fund, with expected return E(r&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;) = 6%, and with the standard deviation of annual returns = 20% (these values are very close to the values for the historical returns of the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index fund from 1998 through 2011). Let the other asset be a risk-free asset with return r&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; = 1% (since r&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; is known with certainty, E(r&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;) = r&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;). The rate of return of the risk-free asset is referred to as the ''risk-free rate of return'', or simply the ''risk-free rate''. The standard deviation of the risk-free asset is 0% by definition. Applying the above equation to this portfolio:

:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{E}(r_p) = w_s \operatorname{E}(r_s) + (1 - w_s)(r_f)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{E}(r_p) = w_s \operatorname{E}(r_s) - w_s r_f + r_f&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{E}(r_p) = r_f + w_s (\operatorname{E}(r_s) - r_f)&lt;/math&gt;

E(''r&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'') - ''r&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the ''risk premium'' of the risky portfolio. The expected risk premium of an asset is the expected return of the asset in excess of the risk-free rate. Since the risky portfolio here is a stock fund, its risk premium is referred to as the ''equity risk premium'' or ERP (''equities'' is synonymous with ''stocks'').

Plugging in the risk-free rate and the expected return for the stock fund gives:

:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{E}(r_p) = 0.01 + w_s(0.06 - 0.01) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{E}(r_p) = 0.01 + 0.05w_s &lt;/math&gt;

This is a linear equation indicating that a portfolio of any expected return between ''r&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 1% and E(''r&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'') = 6% can be constructed by combining the risky portfolio and risk-free asset in the desired proportions. The risk premium of the stock fund is 0.05 = 5%.

If ''w&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 0, the portfolio consists only of the risk-free asset, and the expected return of the portfolio is simply the risk-free rate:

:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{E}(r_p) = 0.01 + (0.05)(0) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{E}(r_p) = 0.01 = 1% &lt;/math&gt;

If ''w&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 1, the total portfolio consists entirely of the risky portfolio, and the expected return of the total portfolio is the expected return of the risky portfolio:

:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{E}(r_p) = 0.01 + (0.05)(1) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{E}(r_p) = 0.06 = 6% &lt;/math&gt;

If the portfolio is divided evenly between the risky portfolio and the risk-free asset, ''w&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 0.5, and the expected return of the portfolio is:

:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{E}(r_p) = 0.01 + (0.05)(0.5) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{E}(r_p) = 0.01 + (0.025) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{E}(r_p) = 0.035 = 3.5% &lt;/math&gt;

In the case of a portfolio evenly divided between the risky portfolio and the risk-free asset, ''w&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''w&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;'' = &lt;span style="font-size:100%"&gt;&amp;#189;&lt;/span&gt;, and the expected return is simply the average of the returns of the two assets:

:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{E}(r_p) = \frac {0.01 + 0.06}{2} = 0.035 = 3.5% &lt;/math&gt;

''Portfolio of risky assets combined with a risk-free asset: ''Risk'' ''

Because the standard deviation of a risk-free asset is 0%, the standard deviation of a portfolio formed by combining a portfolio of risky assets with a risk-free asset is simply the standard deviation of the risky portfolio times the proportional weight of the risky portfolio:

:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{SD}(p) = \sigma_p = w_s \sigma_s &lt;/math&gt;

So the risk of the total portfolio is linearly proportional to the weight of the risky portfolio. Given the standard deviation of annual returns of the risky portfolio of stocks = 20%, a portfolio can be constructed with a standard deviation between 0% and 20%. A portfolio evenly divided between the risky portfolio and the risk-free asset would have a standard deviation of 10%.

''Portfolio of risky assets combined with a risk-free asset: ''expected return in terms of risk'' ''

The above equations can be combined to express the expected return of the total portfolio as a function of its standard deviation, thus ''relating the expected return of the portfolio to its risk''. Rearranging the equation for the standard deviation of the total portfolio gives ''w&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'' = &lt;span style="font-size:100%"&gt;&amp;sigma;&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; / &amp;sigma;&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Therefore,

:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{E}(r_p) = r_f + w_s [\operatorname{E}(r_s) - r_f]&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{E}(r_p) = r_f + \frac{\sigma_p}{\sigma_s}[\operatorname{E}(r_s) - r_f]&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{E}(r_p) = r_f + \frac{[\operatorname{E}(r_s) - r_f]}{\sigma_s} \sigma_p&lt;/math&gt;

This is a linear equation that gives portfolio expected return, &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}(r_p)&lt;/math&gt;, as a function of portfolio risk as measured by standard deviation, &lt;math&gt;\sigma_p&lt;/math&gt;, with intercept ''r&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;'' and slope &lt;math&gt; \frac{\operatorname{E}(r_s) - r_f}{\sigma_s} &lt;/math&gt;. The line plotted from this equation is known is the ''Capital Allocation Line'' or ''CAL'', since capital can be allocated between the risky portfolio and risk-free asset to achieve any risk-return combination along the line.

The slope of the CAL is the ratio of the risky portfolio's excess expected return (risk premium) to its risk (that is, its variability as measured by standard deviation). This reward-to-variability ratio is a widely used measure of portfolio efficiency (risk-adjusted return), and is commonly referred to as the ''Sharpe ratio'' (or Sharpe measure), after William Sharpe who first suggested its use.&lt;ref&gt;Bodie, Kane, Marcus, 2008, p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; The steeper the slope of the CAL, the more efficient the portfolios to choose from.

Although the theory being discussed here involves expected (ex-ante) returns, the Sharpe ratio also is commonly used to evaluate the efficiency or risk-adjusted returns of portfolios (for example, mutual funds) based on historical (ex-post) returns.

[[File:CAL.png|thumb|right|351px||Investment Opportunity Set of Portfolios Using a Risk-Free Asset and One Risky Asset (Capital Allocation Line)]]

Substituting in the example numbers of r&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.01, E(r&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;) = 0.06, and σ&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; = 20% = 0.20:

:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{E}(r_p) = r_f + \frac{[\operatorname{E}(r_s) - r_f]}{\sigma_s} \sigma_p&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{E}(r_p) = 0.01 + \frac{0.06 - 0.01}{0.20} \sigma_p&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{E}(r_p) = 0.01 + 0.25 \sigma_p&lt;/math&gt;

So a portfolio of any expected return between 1% and 6% with proportional standard deviation between 0% and 20% can be constructed by combining the risk-free asset and the risky portfolio in appropriate proportions. With a CAL slope of 0.25, portfolio expected return increases by 1 percentage point for each increase of 4 percentage points in portfolio standard deviation (σ&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;); that is, solving this equation for values of σ&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; = 0%, 4%, 8%, 12%, 16% and 20% gives values for E(r&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;) of 1%, 2%, 3%, 4%, 5% and 6%, as shown in the chart in the nearby figure.

===Portfolio of two risky assets===

This section develops the theory that shows the risk-return characteristics for a portfolio consisting of two risky assets. It will be extended to more than two risky assets in the following section. This is the theory that underlies the practice of combining multiple risky assets into a portfolio that has less risk than the weighted sum of the risks of the individual assets. Examples are a mutual fund that includes many individual securities, and a portfolio of mutual funds that includes different asset classes; for example, domestic stocks, foreign stocks, and bonds.

In considering two risky assets, it is convenient to consider two mutual funds, but the same theory applies to any two assets; for example, two individual stocks. In the following section in which portfolios of many assets are considered, it will be more convenient to consider individual securities.

The statistical measures ''covariance'' and ''correlation'' are fundamental to calculating the risk-return characteristics of a portfolio consisting of multiple risky assets. 

Covariance is a measure of how the values of two dependent variables move together, or co-vary, as the value of a common independent variable changes.&lt;ref&gt;Reilly, 1994, p. 245&lt;/ref&gt; The dependent variables of interest in portfolio theory are the returns of the assets in the portfolio, and the independent variable could be a scenario (for example, the state of the economy) or a time period.

Consider the product of the deviations of returns for two assets, stock fund ''s'' and bond fund ''b'', from their expected values for a particular scenario (or during a certain time period):

:&lt;math&gt;
[r_s - \operatorname{E}(r_s)][r_b - \operatorname{E}(r_b)]
&lt;/math&gt;

If the returns of the two assets are both above their expected values (both deviations are positive), or the returns of the two assets are both below their expected values (both deviations are negative), the product of the deviations will be positive. If the return of one asset is above its expected value (positive deviation), and the return of the other asset is below its expected value (negative deviation), the product of the deviations will be negative. Thus the sign of the product of the deviations indicates whether or not the returns have deviated in the same direction or opposite directions, and the magnitude of the product of the deviations indicates how much the returns have deviated from their expected values. The covariance of returns is the expected value of the products of the deviations across all scenarios:

:&lt;math&gt;
\operatorname{Cov}(r_s,r_b) = \sum_{i=1}^n p(i)[(r_s(i) - \operatorname{E}(r_s)][r_b(i) - \operatorname{E}(r_b)]
&lt;/math&gt;

where p(i) is the probability for scenario i, and r&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;(i) and r&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;(i) are the respective returns for the stock and bond fund for scenario i.

Often a more convenient measure to work with is the ''correlation coefficient'', which is computed by dividing the covariance by the product of the standard deviations of the two assets:

:&lt;math&gt;
\rho_{s,b} = \frac{\operatorname{Cov}(r_s,r_b)}{\sigma_s \sigma_b}
&lt;/math&gt;

The correlation coefficient varies from -1 for two perfectly uncorrelated variables to 1 for perfectly correlated variables. A correlation coefficient of 0 indicates no correlation between the two variables.

The variance of the rate of return of a portfolio consisting of two risky assets, in this case stock fund ''s'' and bond fund ''b'', is given by this equation:

:&lt;math&gt;
\sigma_p^2 = (w_s \sigma_s)^2 + (w_b \sigma_b)^2 + 2(w_s \sigma_s)(w_b \sigma_b)\rho_{s,b}
&lt;/math&gt;

or equivalently

:&lt;math&gt;
\sigma_p^2 = (w_s \sigma_s)^2 + (w_b \sigma_b)^2 + 2w_s w_b \operatorname{Cov}(r_s,r_b)
&lt;/math&gt;

where w&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; and w&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; represent the respective proportions (weights) of the portfolio invested in the stock and bond funds, and σ&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; and σ&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; are the respective standard deviations of the stock and bond funds.

The portfolio variance depends on the weighted standard deviations of the assets ''plus'' a term that depends on the covariance (or correlation) of the assets. The smaller the correlation between the assets the lower the portfolio variance.

For a correlation coefficient of 1 (perfectly correlated assets), the equation for portfolio variance is:

:&lt;math&gt;
\sigma_p^2 = (w_s \sigma_s)^2 + (w_b \sigma_b)^2 + 2(w_s \sigma_s)(w_b \sigma_b)
&lt;/math&gt;
which reduces to:
:&lt;math&gt;
\sigma_p^2 = (w_s \sigma_s + w_b \sigma_b)^2
&lt;/math&gt;

and the standard deviation is:

:&lt;math&gt;
\operatorname{SD}(p) = \sigma_p = (w_s \sigma_s + w_b \sigma_b)
&lt;/math&gt;

So for two perfectly, positively correlated assets, the portfolio standard deviation is simply the weighted average of the standard deviations of the two assets. ''Any correlation less than 1 will result in a portfolio standard deviation that is less than the weighted average of the standard deviations of the individual assets''. 

Since the portfolio expected return is the weighted average of the returns of the individual assets (as shown in previous sections), but the standard deviation is less than the weighted average of the assets' standard deviations, ''a portfolio of assets that are not perfectly correlated always provides a better risk-return opportunity than the individual assets on their own.''&lt;ref&gt;Bodie, Kane, Marcus, 1996, p. 197&lt;/ref&gt;

As a simple illustration of this important concept, consider a portfolio of two assets that have the same expected value and standard deviation, but that are not perfectly correlated (correlation coefficient less than 1). The expected value of the portfolio will be the same as the expected value of each asset, but the variance (and standard deviation) of the portfolio will be less than the variance (and standard deviation) of each asset (this can be verified with the above equations). This demonstrates how combining risky assets can result in a portfolio that is less risky than either asset on its own.

[[File:TwoRiskyAssets.png|thumb|right|351px||Investment Opportunity Set of Portfolios Formed by Combining Two Risky Assets in Various Proportions]]

To graphically illustrate the diversification benefit of a portfolio consisting of two risky, imperfectly correlated assets, assume estimates of expected returns of 7% and 8% respectively for a total US stock fund and a total international stock fund, respective standard deviations of 18% and 20%, and a correlation coefficient of 0.8. The nearby figure shows a graph of expected return vs. standard deviation for portfolios consisting of various proportions of each fund.

The lower left point represents the return and standard deviation of the US stock fund, and the upper right point represents return and standard deviation of the international stock fund. Every other point represents a portfolio consisting of both funds. Each point represents a 10 percentage point change in the proportions of each fund. The expected return and standard deviations for each point are calculated using the above equations.

Notice that a portfolio consisting of 60% US stocks and 40% international stocks provides a higher expected return (about 7.4%) with a lower standard deviation (about 17.9%) than a portfolio consisting of 100% US stocks. This is because the correlation coefficient, 0.8, is less than 1. If the correlation coefficient were 1, the investment opportunity set would consist of a straight line between the lower left point and the upper right point. The degree to which the investment opportunity set curve bulges to the left of a straight line connecting the endpoints represents the diversification benefit due to imperfect correlation.

Of course expected returns, standard deviations, and correlation coefficients cannot be known in advance, so the diversification benefit of combining two risky assets is only as good as your estimates of these values. It is common to use historical values as a starting point in estimating the inputs required to construct an efficient portfolio. 

For example, based on their analysis of historical returns, Vanguard's research group as concluded that it is reasonable for US investors to allocate between 20% and 40% of the stock portion of their portfolios to international stocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| publisher=Vanguard Investment Counseling &amp; Research| date=2006| url=https://institutional.vanguard.com/iwe/pdf/FASIECR_112006.pdf| title=International Equity: Considerations and Recommendations| accessdate=August 10, 2012}}{{dead link}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vanguard currently allocates 30% to international stocks in the stock portions of their balanced index funds, such as the Target Retirement and LifeStrategy funds.

===Portfolio of many risky assets===

The general equation for the variance of a portfolio of risky assets is:

:&lt;math&gt; \sigma_p^2 = \sum_{i=1}^n w_i^2 \sigma_{i}^2 
 + \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1,j \neq i}^n w_i w_j \sigma_i \sigma_j \rho_{ij}, 
&lt;/math&gt;

Recalling that &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Cov}(i,j) = \sigma_i \sigma_j \rho_{ij} &lt;/math&gt;, the equation can be rewritten more succinctly as:

:&lt;math&gt; \sigma_p^2 = \sum_{i=1}^n w_i^2 \sigma_{i}^2 
 + \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1 j \neq i}^n w_i w_j \operatorname{Cov}(i,j). 
&lt;/math&gt;

The terms summed on the left are the ''variances of the individual assets'' multiplied by the squared portfolio weights of the assets. The double summation on the right represents the summation across all assets of the ''covariance of each pair of assets'' multiplied by the portfolio weights of the assets in each pair. 

The condition &lt;span style="font-size:100%"&gt;''j &amp;#8800; i''&lt;/span&gt; indicates that the covariance of an asset with itself is not included in the double summation. The covariance of an asset with itself is the asset's variance — that is, &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Cov}(i,i) = \sigma_i^2&lt;/math&gt; — and the assets' variances already are included in the summation on the left. To clarify this point, the equation can be rewritten as:

:&lt;math&gt; \sigma_p^2 = \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n w_i w_j \operatorname{Cov}(i,j). 
&lt;/math&gt;

When ''i'' = ''j'', the term included in the sum is:

:&lt;math&gt;w_i w_i \operatorname{Cov}(i,i) = w_i^2 \sigma_i^2&lt;/math&gt;,

which represents term ''i'' in the first summation in the equation as previously written. So factoring out the sum of terms where ''i'' = ''j'' gives the equation as previously written.

Expanding this equation for a portfolio of two risky assets gives:

:&lt;math&gt;
\sigma_p^2 = (w_1 \sigma_1)^2 + (w_2 \sigma_2)^2 
 + w_1 w_2 \operatorname{Cov}(1,2)
 + w_2 w_1 \operatorname{Cov}(2,1).
&lt;/math&gt;

There are two variance terms and two covariance terms. Since &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Cov}(1,2) = \operatorname{Cov}(2,1)&lt;/math&gt;, the equation can be simplified to:

:&lt;math&gt;
\sigma_p^2 = (w_1 \sigma_1)^2 + (w_2 \sigma_2)^2 
 + 2 w_1 w_2 \operatorname{Cov}(1,2).
&lt;/math&gt;

So although there two covariance terms before simplifying, only one covariance term must be calculated. This is the equation used in the previous section. 

For three risky assets the equation expands to:

:&lt;math&gt;
\sigma_p^2 = (w_1 \sigma_1)^2 + (w_2 \sigma_2)^2 
 + 2 w_1 w_2 \operatorname{Cov}(1,2)
 + 2 w_1 w_3 \operatorname{Cov}(1,3)
 + 2 w_2 w_3 \operatorname{Cov}(2,3).
&lt;/math&gt;

There are three variance terms and six original covariance terms, three of which must be calculated after simplifying the equation as written. As more assets are added to the portfolio, the number of covariance terms becomes much larger than the number of variance terms. Specifically, there are ''n'' variance terms and n(n-1) covariance terms (but only n(n-1)/2 covariance terms that must be calculated). It is intuitive that for a large number of assets the covariance terms will dominate the result; that is, ''the covariance between asset pairs will have much more impact on overall portfolio variance than the variances of the individual assets''.

For asset pairs with given expected returns, lower covariance (correlation) between asset pairs in the portfolio results in lower portfolio variance and a more efficient portfolio. Portfolio efficiency is the ratio of expected excess portfolio return to portfolio variance. This demonstrates the diversification benefit of building a portfolio of many assets with less than perfect correlation.

To further illustrate the benefit of diversification, consider the case in which a portfolio is constructed of many assets held in equal proportions. In this case w&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; = &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; for each asset, and the equation for portfolio variance becomes:

:&lt;math&gt; \sigma_p^2 = 
 \sum_{i=1}^n (\frac1n)^2 \sigma_{i}^2 
 + \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1 j \neq i}^n (\frac1n)(\frac1n) \operatorname{Cov}(i,j).
&lt;/math&gt;

With appropriate factoring, this equation can be rewritten as:

:&lt;math&gt; \sigma_p^2 = 
 \frac1n \sum_{i=1}^n \frac1n \sigma_{i}^2 
 + \frac{n-1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1 j \neq i}^n \frac {\operatorname{Cov}(i,j)}{n(n-1)}.
&lt;/math&gt;

The summation of terms on the left is the average variance of the assets. As n becomes large ''1/n'' approaches 0, so the term on the left approaches 0. This term represents the ''nonsystematic risk'' of the individual assets that can be diversified away by including a sufficiently large number of assets in the portfolio. In other words, in a portfolio of many assets, the variances of the individual assets have little impact on the variance of the portfolio.

The double summation of terms on the right is the average covariance of the assets. As n becomes large, ''(n-1)/n'' approaches 1, so the term on the right approaches the average covariance. This term represents the ''systematic risk'' of the portfolio that cannot be diversified away. 

This further demonstrates that it is the covariance between the assets in a portfolio of many assets that dominates the overall portfolio risk, and that the variances of the individual assets have little impact on the overall portfolio risk.

The sources of systematic risk are the economic factors that affect the the overall market. For example, the level of economic growth affects all companies to some extent, and therefore affects the returns of all stocks to some extent.

The portion of an asset's return variation that is ''not'' related to the market portfolio is referred to as ''unsystematic risk'' or ''nonsystematic risk''. The sources of unsystematic risk are the ''firm-specific risks'' of individual companies, as opposed to the broader economic factors that have some effect on all companies.

As shown above, unsystematic risks can be eliminated, or "diversified away", by owning a portfolio of many assets that are not perfectly correlated. So one way to manage risk is to reduce or eliminate unsystematic risk by holding a large number of such securities--ultimately by holding all securities in the market. This is the theoretical foundation for owning a total market mutual fund, such as a total stock market or total bond market index fund.

Determining the expected return and variance of a portfolio using the equations developed so far requires estimating ''n'' expected returns, ''n'' variances, and ''n(n-1)/2'' covariances. For a portfolio of many assets, the number of covariances that must be estimated becomes problematic. Index models provide a solution to this problem. An index model is an implementation of a factor model. The Capital Asset Pricing Model, or CAPM, provides the theoretical foundation for a single-factor model.

===CAPM and single factor models===

Given a simplifying set of assumptions, CAPM provides an equation that relates the excess expected return of asset ''i'' to its expected covariance with the expected excess return of the market portfolio ''M'':

:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{E}(r_i)- r_f = \frac {\operatorname{Cov}(i,M)}{\sigma_M^2} (r_M - r_f)&lt;/math&gt;.

Excess expected return is the expected return of the asset or market portfolio minus the risk-free rate r&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;. The market portfolio is a theoretical portfolio consisting of all marketable, risky assets; for example, stocks, bonds, real estate, commodities, collectibles, and so on. 

Isolating the expected return of asset ''i'' on the left hand side of the equation gives:

:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{E}(r_i) = r_f + \frac {\operatorname{Cov}(i,M)}{\sigma_M^2} (r_M - r_f)&lt;/math&gt;.

Defining the term &lt;math&gt;\frac {\operatorname{Cov}(i,M)}{\sigma_M^2}&lt;/math&gt; as beta (&lt;math&gt;\beta_i&lt;/math&gt;), the equation can be rewritten as:

:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{E}(r_i) = r_f + \beta_i (r_M - r_f)&lt;/math&gt;.

Beta standardizes the measure of systematic risk by dividing the covariance of the asset with the market portfolio, &lt;math&gt;{\operatorname{Cov}(i,M)}&lt;/math&gt;, by the variance of the market portfolio, &lt;math&gt;{\sigma_M^2}&lt;/math&gt;. Since the covariance of an asset with itself is the variance of the asset, this results in a beta of 1 for the market portfolio. The ''expected return-beta'' equation above is the formulation of CAPM most widely used by investment professionals.&lt;ref&gt;Bodie, Kane, Marcus, 1996, p 244&lt;/ref&gt;

The CAPM model relates expected return to expected risk, and involves a theoretical market portfolio consisting of all risky assets. Since expected returns are not observable, and in practice the market portfolio is not observable, factor models and index models were developed to enable investment professionals to put the theory behind CAPM into practice.

In a ''single-factor model'' it is assumed that all unexpected macroeconomic events affecting the asset returns in a market can be summarized by one common factor, and that all remaining uncertainty in asset returns is firm specific.&lt;ref&gt;Bodie, Kane, Marcus, 1996, p. 267&lt;/ref&gt; Recognizing that each firm will have a different sensitivity to macroeconomic events, the following equation relates the return on security ''i'' to the common macroeconomic factor ''F'':

:&lt;math&gt; r_i = \operatorname{E}(r_i) + \beta_i F + e_i &lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}(r_i)&lt;/math&gt; is the expected return on security ''i'' at the beginning of the holding period, &lt;math&gt;\beta_i&lt;/math&gt; is the sensitivity of security ''i'' to macroeconomic factor ''F'', and ''e&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is component of return due to the impact of unanticipated firm-specific events.

A ''single-index model'' uses the excess return on a market index, such as the S&amp;P 500, as a proxy for the common macroeconomic factor. Broader proxies for the market portfolio can be used; for example, all US stocks, all global stocks, or all global stocks and bonds. A single-index model equation for the excess holding period return on security ''i'' is:

:&lt;math&gt; r_i - r_f = \alpha_i + \beta_i (r_M - r_f) + e_i \,&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;\alpha_i&lt;/math&gt; is the security's expected return if the excess market return is 0%, &lt;math&gt;r_M&lt;/math&gt; is the market index return, &lt;math&gt;\beta_i&lt;/math&gt; is the sensitivity of security ''i'' to the market index, and ''e&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the component of return due to unexpected firm-specific events.

Some authors express the single-index model in terms of total returns rather than excess returns.&lt;ref&gt;Elton et. al., 2003, pp. 132-133&lt;/ref&gt;

Using capital ''R'' to represent excess return, the equation can be written more simply as:

:&lt;math&gt; R_i = \alpha_i + \beta_i R_M + e_i \,&lt;/math&gt;.

In this equation &lt;span style="font-size:100%"&gt;''&amp;beta;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;R&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;/span&gt; represents a source of ''systematic risk'' based on the security's sensitivity to the market index (a proxy for macroeconomic factors), and &lt;span style="font-size:120%"&gt;''e&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;/span&gt; represents a source of ''unsystematic risk'' based on firm-specific events.

Since expected returns are not observable, beta typically is calculated using periodic historical returns over a specified time period; for example, weekly or monthly returns over the previous three to five years. For example, Morningstar calculates beta based on monthly returns over the previous 36 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| publisher=Morningstar| date=2005| url=http://corporate.morningstar.com/us/documents/MethodologyDocuments/MethodologyPapers/MorningstarMPTStatistics_Methodology.pdf| title=Morningstar MPT Statistics Methodology| accessdate=August 10, 2012}}{{dead link}}&lt;/ref&gt; The above equation is used as the basis of a linear regression analysis in which the dependent variable is the excess return of the individual asset, R&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, the independent variable is the excess return of the market index, R&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;, and beta is the regression coefficient (slope of the line). 

This can be represented graphically as follows. A scatter plot of R&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; vs. R&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; is generated in which the vertical axis measures the excess returns of the individual asset, and the horizontal axis measures the excess returns of the market index. Each point in the scatter plot represents a pair of excess returns for one period (week or month). A best-fit line is drawn through the points. The slope of the line is beta, and the vertical intercept is alpha. The vertical distance from the line of each point for period ''i'' is e&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, the deviation from the regression line.

The variance of the excess return on security ''i'' can be written as:

:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{Var}(R_i) = \sigma_i^2 = \beta_i^2 \sigma_M^2 + \sigma^2(e_i) &lt;/math&gt;.

On the right hand side of the equation, the first term is the variance due to uncertainty in the common macroeconomic factors (as represented by the market index), and the second term is the variance due to firm-specific uncertainty.

The covariance between the excess rates of return on any two securities is:

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Cov}(R_i,R_j) = \operatorname{Cov}(\beta_i R_M, \beta_j R_M) = \beta_i \beta_j \sigma_M^2
&lt;/math&gt;.

From these equations it can be determined that (3''n'' + 1) estimates are required to evaluate the portfolio variance for ''n'' securities. This is many fewer estimates than the 2''n'' + ''n''(''n'' - 1)/2 estimates required using variances and covariances directly.

=== Multifactor models ===

Although CAPM and the related single-factor model have had significant impact on finance theory and practice, empirical studies have shown significant discrepancies between historical data and predictions of the CAPM-based single factor model. This may not be surprising considering the simplification of assuming that only a single factor affects the systematic variation in security prices. Theoretical work has been done attempting to use more than one factor to explain the systematic risk of securities.

Two of the discrepancies mentioned above are the long-term returns of small company stocks and stocks with high ratios of book value to market value (value stocks), which are higher than predicted by CAPM. Motivated by these anomalies, Fama and French conducted research that resulted in what is commonly referred to as the [[Fama and French three-factor model | Fama-French three-factor model]].

One of the three factors is the market portfolio (more specifically, an index representing the market), as in CAPM. The other two factors are SmB (Small minus Big) and HmL (High minus Low). SmB is a theoretical portfolio represented by the returns of small-cap stocks minus the returns of large-cap stocks (hence, Small minus Big or SmB). HmL is a theoretical portfolio represented by the returns of high book-to-market stocks minus the returns of low book-to-market stocks (hence, High minus Low or HmL).

Fama and French's research indicated that regressing the empirical data against the three factors explained the returns of stock portfolios much better than did the CAPM-based single-factor model. The equation used to perform the regressions is:

:&lt;math&gt; 
r_i - r_f = \alpha_i + \beta_M (r_M - r_f) + \beta_h r_{HmL} + \beta_s r_{SmB} + e_i 
\,&lt;/math&gt;.

Each of the betas in the equation represent the sensitivity of a stock or portfolio of stocks to the corresponding factor. The empirically derived beta values can be considered as explaining how much of a portfolio's return can be explained by exposure to the respective factors. A portfolio more heavily weighted toward small-cap and value stocks would be expected to have higher values of &lt;span style="font-size:100%"&gt;''&amp;beta;&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="font-size:100%"&gt;''&amp;beta;&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;/span&gt;.

This result is based on empirical research, not a theory related to specific risk factors. Therefore, one conclusion is that SmB and HmL may be ''proxies'' for exposure to sources of systematic risk not captured by the single CAPM factor of overall market risk.

Investors who believe that SmB and HmL are valid proxies for systematic risk factors may decide to increase their allocations to small-cap stocks and value stocks. This is informally referred to as ''tilting'' toward small and value.

==Assessing risk tolerance==
{{Main|Assessing risk tolerance}}

Assessing risk tolerance is a critical step in determining the appropriate trade off between the risk and expected return of a portfolio. Selecting a mix of risky and risk-free assets (or higher-risk and lower-risk assets) is one of the most important decisions in designing a portfolio. The investor must develop a rational assessment of risk tolerance to make rational decisions about this asset allocation during portfolio design.

=== Criteria ===
Most approaches to assessing risk tolerance consider attitude toward risk and investment time horizon in one way or another. Other factors that affect ability to compensate for investment losses include net worth, stability of income, future liabilities, and flexibility of goals.

*The [[Bogleheads' Guide To Investing]] explores four areas: Goals, Time frame, Risk tolerance, Personal financial situation. Tools are recommended to help factor risk into your asset allocation. Various sample portfolios are presented based on these "stages in life". 
*Bogleheads author [[Larry Swedroe]] suggests that investors evaluate their risk tolerance by considering their ''ability, willingness and need'' to take risk.
*Bogleheads author [[William Bernstein]] discusses determining appropriate risk exposure in the context of deciding on your allocation between stocks and bonds based on age and risk tolerance (attitude toward risk), at least as a starting point.
*Bogleheads author [[Rick Ferri]] suggests using a modified version of the age in bonds rule of thumb to help decide on the split between higher-risk and lower-risk assets, and presents asset allocation decisions in terms of a life-cycle investing framework.
*Daniel R. Solin in his book ''The Smartest Money Book You'll Ever Read'', has a full chapter titles ''Assessing Your Risk Capacity'' where he presents five major factors for assessing risk capacity.
*The CFA Institute discusses Investors and Objectives, Investor constraints (Liquidity, Investment Horizon, Regulations, Tax Considerations, Unique Needs.

=== Self-assessment questionnaires ===
Various advisory services offer self-assessment questionnaires to help determine your risk tolerance and define an initial asset allocation. Such tools are useful with caveats.

==Managing financial risk==

Investment risk, or financial-asset risk, is only one type of financial risk facing households. Other major categories of risk are:&lt;ref&gt;Bodie, Merton, 2000, p. 259&lt;/ref&gt;

* Sickness, disability, and death.
* Unemployment risk.
* Consumer-durable asset risk: for example, the risk of loss from fire, theft or obsolescence related to owning a car, house, or other consumer-durable asset. 
* Liability risk: for example, the possibility of being sued.

Managing these types of risks, as well as managing investment risk, from a broader financial planning perspective is the topic of this section.

==Short term risk vs. long term risk==
Mentioned in "Risk as the possibility of loss" section, perhaps here we go into more detail on terminal wealth dispersion, how small differences in annualized return can result in large differences in terminal wealth, stocks ''are'' risky in the long run, and so on. This is covered in Bodie, Kane, Marcus, 2008.

See Bernstein's [http://www.efficientfrontier.com/ef/900/15st.htm "The 15 Stock Myth"] for more on terminal wealth dispersion, but there he focuses on the danger of a portfolio with only a small number of stocks. He does emphasize that such portfolios, although they may have low standard deviation of monthly returns, also have a large dispersion of terminal wealth.

However, investors usually think of risk as the possibility that their investments could lose money.

'''Risk tolerance''' is your emotional and psychological ability to endure investment losses during large market declines without selling or undue worry, such as losing sleep. To know whether a portfolio is right for your risk tolerance, you need to be brutally honest with yourself as you try to answer the question, "Will I sell during the next [[Bear market|bear market]]?"&lt;ref name="Guide"&gt;{{cite book| title=Bogleheads' Guide To Investing| title-link=Bogleheads' Guide To Investing| author1=Taylor Larimore| author2=Mel Lindauer| author3=Michael LeBoeuf| author1-link=Taylor Larimore| author2-link=Mel Lindauer| author3-link=Michael LeBoeuf| edition=2nd| publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons| isbn=978-1-118-92128-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Risk tolerance defined==
Author [[Rick Ferri]] defines risk tolerance as:&lt;ref name="AllAbout"&gt;{{cite book| title=All About Asset Allocation| title-link=All About Asset Allocation| author=Rick Ferri| author-link=Rick Ferri| edition=2nd| publisher=McGraw-Hill| isbn=978-0-07-170078-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quotation|...a measure of the amount of price volatility and investment loss you can withstand before changing your behavior. ... An emotional decision to change or abandon an investment plan as a result of market risk ultimately increases portfolio risk and reduces return. If an investor has been in a bad market long enough to lose money, that investor doesn’t want to be out of the market when it turns around. That becomes a strategy of all risk and no return.}}

Bogleheads author [[William Bernstein]] uses ''risk tolerance'' in the sense of attitude toward risk. He suggests that investors can evaluate their risk tolerance based on how they reacted to the financial crisis during 2008 and early 2009:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=William Bernstein| author-link=William Bernstein| date=2010| title=The Investor's Manifesto| publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc| isbn=978-0-470-50514-4| pages=75-80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Sold: low risk tolerance
*Held steady: moderate risk tolerance
*Bought more: high risk tolerance
*Bought more and hoped for further declines: very high risk tolerance

You can adjust the level of risk in your portfolio by adjusting your [[asset allocation]].

==Why is risk tolerance important?==

Risk tolerance is a key factor for creating your [[asset allocation]] (the percentage of [[Stock basics | stocks]], [[Bond basics | bonds]], and cash or [[Money markets | cash equivalents]])&lt;ref group="note"&gt;''Fixed income'' is sometimes considered to be a combination of bonds and cash. See [[Fixed income]].&lt;/ref&gt; that will let you stay the course during inevitable market downturns.

=== Ability, willingness and need to take risk ===
Author [[Larry Swedroe]] defines asset allocation as "the process of investing assets in a manner reflecting one’s unique ability, willingness and need to take risk," with willingness referring to risk tolerance and whether you have the "fortitude and discipline" to stay with an allocation during market downturns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Larry Swedroe| author-link=Larry Swedroe| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/asset-allocation-guide-how-much-risk-should-you-take/| title=Asset Allocation Guide: How much risk should you take?| publisher=CBS Moneywatch| date=February 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Larry Swedroe| author-link=Larry Swedroe| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/asset-allocation-guide-what-is-your-risk-tolerance/| title=Asset Allocation Guide: What is your risk tolerance?| publisher=CBS Moneywatch| date=February 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Larry Swedroe| author-link=Larry Swedroe| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/asset-allocation-guide-how-much-risk-do-you-need/| title=Asset Allocation Guide: How much risk do you need?| publisher=CBS Moneywatch| date=February 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ability''' to take risk involves your investment time horizon, need for liquidity, stability of earned income, and your flexibility to adapt if you need a plan B.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;From: [[Asset allocation]]:

''Ability'' relates to an investor's ability to withstand the ups and downs of the market without getting nervous and making changes to the asset allocation. Selling in the face of a decline is about the worst thing an investor can do. Here is a table offered by author [[Larry Swedroe]], based on the 1970s bear market, showing the amount of decline for various stock/bond allocations:
{|
| style="vertical-align:top;" |
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center"
!Asset allocation %&lt;br&gt;(stock/bond)
!Exposure to&lt;br&gt;maximum loss
|-
||20/80||5%
|-
||30/70||10%
|-
||40/60||15%
|-
||50/50||20%
|-
||60/40||25%
|}
| style="vertical-align:top;" |
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center"
!Asset allocation %&lt;br&gt;(stock/bond)
!Exposure to&lt;br&gt;maximum loss
|-
||70/30||30%
|-
||80/20||35%
|-
||90/10||40%
|-
||100/0||50%
|}
|}

For example, an investor would be willing to accept a loss of 35% in the portfolio if they held an allocation of (80% stocks / 20% bonds). This table is from the 1970s; performance during other time periods will have different results. The general idea is for investors to select an asset allocation they are comfortable with.

'''Willingness''' to take risk is characterized as the eat well/sleep well trade-off. You need to take more risk for the possibility of higher expected returns (eat well). However, if you take more risk than you can handle emotionally, then it is likely that you will abandon your investment plans if your portfolio suffers big enough losses. So it is unwise for you to take so much risk that you will not sleep well during the inevitable stock market downturns.

'''Need''' to take risk is determined by the rate of return you need to achieve your financial objectives. If you decide to take more risk because of perceived "need", remember that taking extra risk could well backfire and lead to lower returns. Perhaps more importantly, once you have "won the game" by accumulating sufficient wealth, it is unwise to take more risk than you need, because the value of additional gains is much less important than the consequences of severe losses.

==Why is risk tolerance difficult to determine?==
Knowing your emotional tolerance for investment risk means knowing yourself and your unique goals and needs - and it is not easy.

Jason Zweig writes in his book on neuroscience, ''Your Money &amp; Your Brain'', that "... ''perception of investment risk'' is in constant flux, depending on your memories of past experiences, whether you are alone or part of a group, how familiar and controllable the risk feels to you, how it is described, and what mood you happen to be in at the moment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jason Zweig|title=Your Money &amp; Your Brain|date=2007|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|location=New York|page=128|isbn=978-0-7432-7668-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Investors are often asked by financial advisors to take risk tolerance questionnaires intended to help determine how aggressive or conservative their investments should be. But Jane Bryant Quinn in her book, ''How to Make Your Money Last'', calls the questionnaires "... generally bunk. You’ll lean toward more risk if stocks are going up, you’ve had a good day at the office and your shoes don’t pinch. If you’ve had a bad day because stocks went down and your unemployed child is moving in, you’ll suddenly feel more conservative."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jane Bryant Quinn|title=How to Make Your Money Last: The Indispensable Retirement Guide|date=2016|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|location=New York|page=230|isbn=978-1-4767-4376-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rick Ferri]] says some questionnaires that are worded well may be helpful, but "...overall they are not the answer to the asset allocation question. ... Finding a person’s maximum tolerance for risk takes a lot more than a questionnaire. It requires soul-searching. We tend to be brave in a bull market, and this means that it is not the ideal time to search for our risk tolerance. Soul-searching should be done in a bear market when we are not sure what is going to happen next."&lt;ref name="AllAbout" /&gt;

}}
Understanding and avoiding '''behavioral pitfalls''' has a greater final impact on your investing success than any other factor. Because emotions and subsequent behavioral pitfalls often lead to miscalculating [[risk tolerance]] and [[Asset allocation|asset allocation]], you need to be aware of behavioral pitfalls before making asset allocation decisions. 

An important pitfall to be aware of is '''loss aversion''', the emotional tendency to strongly prefer avoiding losses over acquiring gains. As an example, loss aversion implies that if we lose $100, our emotional pain is much larger than the satisfaction we would feel from receiving $100. Common indications include checking your portfolio on an almost daily basis, selling funds before you intended to lock in profits, or selling when you did not intend to in order to avoid further losses.

Selecting a mix of risky and risk-free assets (or higher-risk and lower-risk assets) is one of the most important decisions in designing a portfolio. Investors must develop a rational assessment of [[risk tolerance]] to make rational decisions about portfolio design.

Most approaches to assessing risk tolerance consider these criteria in one way or another:
*Attitude toward risk
*Investment time horizon
*Other factors that affect ability to compensate for investment losses, for example, net worth, stability of income, future liabilities, and flexibility of goals.

This article presents several frameworks to help you to assess your risk tolerance. It uses the term ''risk tolerance'' to describe both an investor's capacity to bear risk and their attitude toward risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author1=Zvi Bodie| author2=Robert C Merton| title=Finance| date=2000| publisher=Pearson| page=322| isbn=978-0-13-310897-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some authors use the term ''risk tolerance'' to describe only an investor's attitude toward risk; that is, the psychological and emotional aspects related to taking risk. To avoid confusion, the article uses "determining appropriate risk exposure" instead of "assessing risk tolerance" for frameworks that use the term ''risk tolerance'' to refer only to an investor's attitude toward risk. 

== Risk tolerance ==
{{main article|Risk tolerance}}

Risk is the uncertainty (variation) of an investment's return, which does not distinguish between a loss or a gain. However, investors usually think of risk as the possibility that their investments could lose money. 

'''Risk tolerance''' is an investor’s emotional and psychological ability to endure investment losses during large market declines without selling or undue worry, such as losing sleep. 

To know whether a portfolio is right for your risk tolerance, you need to be brutally honest with yourself as you try to answer the question, "Will I sell during the next bear market?"

Knowing your emotional tolerance for investment risk means knowing yourself and your unique goals and needs - and it is not easy. The next sections show different ways you can assess your risk tolerance.

==Boglehead's Guide To Investing==
The ''[[Bogleheads' Guide To Investing]]'' discusses determining appropriate risk exposure in the chapter on [[asset allocation]]. The context is designing an efficient portfolio and "staying the course".

The book explores four areas:
* Goals
* Time frame
* Risk tolerance
* Personal financial situation

Examples of '''goals''' are saving for a home, a child's education, or retirement.

Stocks are suitable for long '''time frames''', whereas medium and short-time frames require less risky investments. 

'''Risk tolerance''' is about the psychological and emotional ability to stick with the investment plan during large market declines. Whether or not you think you could sleep well at night (the ''sleep test'') with your current asset allocation (proportions of stocks, bonds and cash) is one indicator of risk tolerance.

Your own '''personal financial situation''' affects how much risk and what types of risk are appropriate. Stability of income and net worth affect the need to take risk. Investors with higher guaranteed retirement incomes (for example, a pension or social security) or high net worth do not need to take as much risk; that is, they have a lower requirement to invest in stocks.

The book refers to three tools, along with an investor's own experience, to help factor risk into your asset allocation:
* [[John Bogle]], founder of Vanguard, suggests that a rough "rule of thumb" to hold your '''age in bonds'''.
* Consider the '''maximum decline''' to expect with various stock/bond ratios. The original version of the book presents maximum declines in the 2000 to 2002 bear market, but the maximum declines in the 2008/2009 bear market were worse; a common rule of thumb is to be prepared for a 50% loss in the stock portion of your portfolio.
* Vanguard provides an online questionnaire and suggested asset allocations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| publisher=Vanguard| url=https://investor.vanguard.com/tools-calculators/investor-questionnaire| title=Investor Questionnaire| accessdate=July 18, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book includes a version of the questionnaire as an Appendix, but see the [https://investor.vanguard.com/tools-calculators/investor-questionnaire Vanguard website] for the latest version.

The book presents various sample portfolios based on these "stages in life":
* Young investor
* Middle-aged investor
* Investor in early retirement
* Investor in late retirement

==Larry Swedroe: ability, willingness, and need to take risk==

Bogleheads author [[Larry Swedroe]] suggests that investors evaluate their risk tolerance by considering their '''ability, willingness and need''' to take risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Larry Swedroe| author-link=Larry Swedroe| url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/asset-allocation-guide-how-much-risk-should-you-take/| title=Asset Allocation Guide: How much risk should you take?| publisher=CBS Moneywatch| date=February 3, 2014| accessdate=July 18, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Larry Swedroe| author-link=Larry Swedroe| url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/asset-allocation-guide-what-is-your-risk-tolerance/| title=Asset Allocation Guide: What is your risk tolerance?| publisher=CBS Moneywatch| date=February 12, 2014| accessdate=July 18, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Larry Swedroe| author-link=Larry Swedroe| url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/asset-allocation-guide-how-much-risk-do-you-need/| title=Asset Allocation Guide: How much risk do you need?| publisher=CBS Moneywatch| date=February 19, 2014| accessdate=July 18, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ability''' to take risk involves investment time horizon, liquidity needs, stability of earned income, and the flexibility to adapt if the portfolio does not achieve its expected returns (that is, "plan B").

'''Willingness''' to take risk is characterized as the eat well/sleep well trade-off. Taking more risk is required to enable the possibility of higher expected returns (eat well). However, if investors take more risk than they are emotionally able to handle, then it is likely that they will abandon their investment plans if their portfolios suffer sufficiently severe losses. So it is unwise for investors to take so much risk that they will be unable to sleep well during the inevitable stock market downturns.

'''Need''' to take risk is related to the investment goal. If the goal requires a higher expected return, an investor needs to take more risk with the expectation that doing so will result in a higher return. Perhaps more importantly, once an investor has "won the game" by accumulating sufficient wealth, it is unwise to take more risk than is needed, since the value of additional gains is much less important than the consequences of severe losses.

==William Bernstein==

Bogleheads author [[William Bernstein]] discusses determining appropriate risk exposure in the context of deciding on your allocation between stocks and bonds based on age and risk tolerance (attitude toward risk), at least as a starting point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=William Bernstein| author-link=William Bernstein| title=The Four Pillars of Investing| date=2010| pages=75-80| publisher=McGraw Hill| isbn=978-0-07-174705-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A very young investor has many years to take advantage of the inevitable bear markets by buying stocks at depressed prices. At the other extreme, a retired person typically is spending down savings, and therefore an extended bear market is more likely to endanger the likelihood that a stock-heavy investment portfolio will last through retirement.

In finance terms, younger investors have more [[Human capital | human capital]]; that is, their total future earnings are much larger than their investment portfolio. By contrast, a retired investor who is not working has no human capital. Human capital can be considered as a bond-like investment, so the high value of a young investor's human capital can justify a higher allocation to stocks.

Middle-aged investors fall somewhere in the middle, so perhaps might consider dividing their portfolio evenly between stocks and bonds.

Other than age, risk tolerance is the other major consideration in determining asset allocation. Bernstein uses ''risk tolerance'' in the sense of attitude toward risk. Bernstein suggests that investors can evaluate their risk tolerance based on how they reacted to the financial crisis during 2008 and early 2009:

*Sold: low risk tolerance
*Held steady: moderate risk tolerance
*Bought more: high risk tolerance
*Bought more and hoped for further declines: very high risk tolerance

Bernstein mentions age in bonds as the most common age-based rule of thumb, and suggests that investors might modify this based on risk tolerance as follows (stated in terms of percentage point increase or decrease to the stock allocation):

*Very High: +20%
*High: +10%
*Moderate: 0%
*Low: -10%
*Very Low: -20%

For example, a 50-year-old with moderate risk tolerance might hold a 50/50 stock/bond allocation (age in bonds), while a 50-year-old with very high risk tolerance might hold a 70/30 stock/bond portfolio.

Bernstein emphasizes that this is just a starting point. A very wealthy, frugal retiree might have a higher stock allocation since the chance of running out of money is low, and the investment time horizon is relatively long considering the lifetimes of their heirs and other beneficiaries. At the other end of the spectrum, a retiree whose annual living expenses consume a relatively large percentage of retirement savings might consider reducing spending and use most retirement savings to purchase a fixed annuity.

Bernstein points out that investors who have not lived through serious market declines tend to overestimate their risk tolerance. He strongly urges that investors invest conservatively until they have experienced their first bear market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=William Bernstein| author-link=William Bernstein| title=The Four Pillars of Investing| date=2010| page=124| publisher=McGraw Hill| isbn=978-0-07-174705-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; This gives them the chance to determine how they will behave as they see the value of the stock portion of their portfolio decline significantly; for example, will they have the discipline to rebalance from bonds to stocks when it seems most frightening to do so?

Bernstein presents a criterion he describes as the "equipoise point" to help with the stock/bond allocation decision. This is the point at which the pleasure of seeing the stock portion of your portfolio increase in value during a bull market just offsets the regret of not having a higher allocation to stocks. It also is the point at which the pain of stock losses during a bear market counterbalances the positive feelings provided by your bonds (which can be rebalanced into stocks at lower prices).

==Rick Ferri: lifecycle model==

Bogleheads author [[Rick Ferri]] suggests using a modified version of the age in bonds rule of thumb to help decide on the split between higher-risk and lower-risk assets, and presents asset allocation decisions in terms of a life-cycle investing framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=All About Asset Allocation| title-link=All About Asset Allocation| author=Rick Ferri| author-link=Rick Ferri| edition=2nd| publisher=McGraw Hill| pages=243-289| isbn=978-0-07-170078-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Age is an important factor in determining asset allocation. Older investors have less time to make up losses, and if still working, have fewer years to replace those losses from savings. However, applying the simple age in bonds rule of thumb is more appropriate for younger investors than for older investors.

The financial situations of younger investors are less diverse, so holding your age in bonds probably is a reasonable guideline. Financial assets are small relative to future earnings, so large stock market fluctuations will have relatively small impact on long-term wealth. A 70/30 stock/bond allocation probably is fine for most 30-year-olds.

However, there is much more diversity in the financial situations of older investors; for example, accumulated wealth, access to pension plans, family size, and so on. Although you can use age in bonds as a starting point, it is much more likely that you will need to make significant adjustments based on your personal financial situation. The concept of "asset allocation age" aims to account for these factors.

For example, investors whose wealth is large relative to spending needs can afford to take more risk, and therefore have asset allocation ages that may be higher than their chronological ages. Examples of factors to consider in determining asset allocation age are income needs, retirement needs, pensions, living expenses, bequeathing goals, passive income sources, attitude toward risk, debt, and possible inheritances.

You can also use a life-cycle investing model to help decide on how to allocate portfolio assets between higher-risk stocks and lower-risk fixed-income investments. There are four life phases to consider:

*Early savers, typically ages 20 to 39, with an appropriate allocation to stocks in the range of 60% to 80%.
*Midlife accumulators, typically ages 40 to 59, with an appropriate allocation to stocks in the range of 50% to 70%.
*Transitional retirees, typically ages 60 to 79, with an appropriate allocation to stocks in the range of 30% to 70%.
*Mature retirees, typically age 80 and up, with an appropriate allocation to stocks in the range of 20% to 60%.

Developing a good understanding of how you are likely to react to market volatility and bear markets is also critical in determining an appropriate asset allocation. Risk tolerance is defined as "a measure of the amount of price volatility and investment loss you can withstand before changing your behavior."

Although risk tolerance questionnaires can be useful as a starting point in discovering your risk tolerance, they generally are not sufficient. An asset allocation stress test is another useful tool. This involves working through a bear market scenario, month by month, using a target portfolio with real dollar amounts, and determining if you are likely to stick with a rebalancing plan as the value of the portfolio declines.

Daniel Solin is the author of ''[[Smartest Investment Book You'll Ever Read |The Smartest Investment Book You'll Ever Read]]'', listed in the Bogleheads [[Book recommendations and reviews]], and the subject of [https://web.archive.org/web/20210509223427/https://socialize.morningstar.com/NewSocialize/asp/FullConv.asp?forumId=F100000015&amp;lastConvSeq=54472 this Taylor's Gem].

Chapter 29 in another one of Solin's books, ''The Smartest Money Book You'll Ever Read'', is titled ''Assessing Your Risk Capacity''. Solin presents five major factors for assessing risk capacity:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Daniel R Solin| title=The Smartest Money Book You'll Ever Read| date=2012| publisher=Penguin Group| pages=138-141| isbn=978-0-399-53721-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Time horizon and liquidity needs. Longer time horizon and lower shorter-term liquidity needs increase risk capacity.
*Income and savings rate. Higher income and savings rate increase risk capacity.
*Net worth. Higher net worth increases risk capacity.
*Attitude toward risk. This is what most people refer to as ''risk tolerance'', and is the emotional component of handling losses.
*Investment knowledge. The better your understanding of portfolio theory and the risk-return trade off, the higher your risk capacity.

Solin provides a [https://www.ifa.com/SurveyNET/index.aspx Risk Capacity Survey] on his website. There is a quick survey with five questions, a 25-question "complete" survey, and a 19-question survey for [[401(k)]] plans.

      <text bytes="21737" sha1="h4m5n7e78gdwi66c805kim6e1wo2htg" xml:space="preserve">'''"{{PAGENAMEBASE}}'''" shows how missing the best days of the stock market can significantly decrease your investment.

'''Example''': Assume that on 1990-01-01, you invest a lump sum into the stock market. (1990-01-01 was New Year's Day, and the stock market was closed, so assume that you invest on the next market day.) In the next 15 years, you stay invested, except that you miss some best days of the stock market. How much do you lose, as a percentage, if you define 100% to be what you would have, if you were to miss zero best days?

See the table below. See the row with "15" in the column "Years":

* If you miss 0 best days, you lose 0%.
* If you miss the 1 best day, you lose 5%.
* If you miss the 2 best days, you lose 10%.
* If you miss the 3 best days, you lose 15%.
* If you miss the 4 best days, you lose 19%.
* If you miss the 5 best days, you lose 23%.

==Problem==

Stated more precisely:

* Assume that you invest a lump sum into the stock market, from some start date to some end date.
* Assume that you stay invested, except that you miss some number of best days.
* Assume that you reinvest dividends. Use the following stock index: Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Total Return. This was used by other organizations who did work similar to ours. You can download this index at, for example, [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5ESP500TR/history?p=%5ESP500TR Yahoo Finance], which has data from 1988-01-05.
* Temporarily imagine that you miss zero best days. The final value of your investment---consider it as "100%."
* What percent of your investment do you lose by missing the best days?

The above problem is somewhat not realistic, in that it assumes that you miss only the best days:

* If you invest into the stock market over many years, and miss a few days, there is a low probability that these days are the best days. Consider the following example. Assume that you invest for 5 years into the stock market. Assume that you (randomly) miss 2 days. What is the probability that these 2 days are the 2 best days? A year might have around 260 market days. So the number of 2-combinations is around &lt;math&gt;{5 \times 260 \choose 2} = {1300 \choose 2} = 1300 \times 1299 / 2 = 844,350&lt;/math&gt;. So the probability that the 2 missed days are the 2 best days is around &lt;math&gt;1/844,350&lt;/math&gt;, which is around zero.

* On 2019-02-08, the financial blog The Irrelevant Investor had an article called [https://theirrelevantinvestor.com/2019/02/08/miss-the-worst-days-miss-the-best-days/ Miss the Worst Days, Miss the Best Days], by Michael Batnick. He considered the S&amp;P 500 Total Return from 1990 to 2019. He wrote, "The best days often follow the worst days, and the worst days occur in periods of above average volatility (red dotted line). These volatility spikes happen in lousy markets, so, if you can avoid the very best days, you will probably also avoid the very worst days, thereby avoiding lousy markets."

Although the above problem is somewhat not realistic, considering it may be beneficial:

* Other organizations considered a similar problem. Later, we discuss their results.
* Other organizations and we have a common result: missing the best days of the stock market can significantly decrease your investment, as we had mentioned in the introduction.
* This common result is similar to results by Professor H. Nejat Seyhun, at the University of Michigan, whose work was commissioned by the financial company Towneley Capital Management. They did two studies, whose results are similar to each other:
** 'Between 1926 and 1993, more than 99% of the total dollar returns were "earned" during only 5.9% of the months. For the 31-year period from 1963 to 1993, a scant 1.2% of the trading days accounted for 95% of the market gains.' This statement is from the conclusion (on paper-page 9, or PDF-page 11) of [https://www.towneley.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Research.-TCM-Mkt-Timing-Study-1993.pdf Stock market extremes and portfolio performance].
** 'Between 1926 and 2004, more than 99% of the total dollar returns were "earned" during only 5.1% of the months. For the 42-year period from 1963 to 2004, a scant 0.85% of the trading days accounted for 96% of the market gains.' This statement is from the conclusion (on PDF-page 12) of [http://www.towneley.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Research.-TCM-Mkt-Timing-Study-2004.pdf Stock market extremes and portfolio performance 1926--2004].

* This common result is similar to the following research, which we could paraphrase as: missing the best stocks can significantly decrease your investment.
** "[T]he best-performing 4% of listed companies explain the net gain for the entire US stock market since 1926, as other stocks collectively matched Treasury bills." This statement is from the abstract of the paper [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304405X18301521 Do stocks outperform Treasury bills?], by Hendrik Bessembinder, Journal of Financial Economics, volume 129, issue 3, pages 440-457, 2018-09-01.
* This common result agrees with some advice and research about buying and holding investments, which we state or paraphrase below:
** Stay the course.
** Set it and forget it.
** Don't do something! Just stand there!
** Time in the market beats timing the market.
** Don't look for the needle. Buy the haystack. (This advice says to buy the total stock market, but we could interpret it as saying to be invested in all market days.)
** "Of 66,465 households with accounts at a large discount broker during 1991 to 1996, those that trade most earn an annual return of 11.4 percent, while the market returns 17.9 percent." This statement is from the abstract of the paper [https://www.jstor.org/stable/222522 Trading Is Hazardous to Your Wealth: The Common Stock Investment Performance of Individual Investors], by  Brad M. Barber and Terrance Odean, The Journal of Finance, volume 55, number 2, pages 773--806, 2000-04-01.

==A formula for how much you lose if you miss some days of the stock market==

This section may be skipped.

This section generalizes previous sections. The main result is a formula for how much you lose if you miss some days of the stock market. Use the following assumptions:

* You invest into the stock market on a set of market days.
** The set is not empty.
** The market days do not need to be consecutive.
* You miss a subset of market days.
** The subset can be empty.
** The subset is not  all market days.
** The missed market days do not need to be consecutive.
** The missed market days can be the best, the worst, in between, or any combination of these possibilities.
* We use other assumptions or definitions which might not be conventional.

This section is related to previous sections as follows:

* Previous sections have dollar amounts. If we ignore any mistakes in the dollar amounts, then the dollar amounts are the products of three things: the initial investment, the "total return," and the "relative return."
* Previous sections have percent losses. These are "relative losses" and can be calculated as one minus a "relative return."

'''Assumption about the (daily) return''': The (daily) return of a market day is its close, divided by the close of the previous market day.

'''Assumption about the (total) return''': The (total) return of a set of market days is the product of the (daily) returns.

'''Theorem about the (total) return if the market days are consecutive''': Assume that the market days are consecutive. Then the (total) return is the close of the last market day, divided by the close of the market day before the first market day.

'''Proof''': The (total) return is the product of the (daily) returns, each of which is a fraction. There are two cases. If there is one market day, then the statement is true. If there is more than one market day, then for the second fraction and later fractions, the denominator equals the numerator of the previous fraction. This situation results in cancelation. We are left with the denominator of the first fraction and the numerator of the last fraction. The statement is true.

'''Definition of the "relative return"''': The "relative return" is the (total) return of the non-missed market days, divided by the (total) return of all market days.

'''Theorem about when the "relative return" is 100%''': If you miss zero days, the "relative" return is 100%.

'''Example about when the "relative return" is more than 100%''': This situation might seem paradoxical. But it can happen when the stock market is decreasing. Assume that you invest for two consecutive market days, whose (daily) returns are 90% and 80%, respectively. Assume that you miss the first market day. The "relative return" is &lt;math&gt;0.80 / (0.90 \times 0.80) = 1/0.90 &gt; 1 = 100%&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Theorem about a formula for the "relative return"''': The "relative return" is one divided by the (total) return of the missed market days.

'''Proof''': A "relative return" is a fraction. The numerator is a product of the (daily) returns of non-missed market days. The denominator is a product of the (daily) returns of all market days. All terms in the numerator cancel with identical terms in the denominator. The new numerator is one. The new denominator is the product of the (daily) returns of the missed market days.

'''Definition of the "relative loss"''': The "relative loss" is one minus the "relative return."

'''Theorem about a formula for the "relative loss"''': The "relative loss" is one minus the fraction of one divided by the (total) return of the missed market days.

==Algorithms to calculate how much you lose if you miss the best days of the stock market==

This section may be skipped.

We describe algorithms to calculate how much you lose if you miss the best days of the stock market. Also, we calculate the time complexity of the algorithms. There may exist better algorithms. Use the following notation and assumptions:

* Let &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; be the number of market days in an input file.
* Let &lt;math&gt;D &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;.
* Let &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; be the number of best market days to miss.
* Let &lt;math&gt;0 &lt; B &lt; D&lt;/math&gt;.
* Possibly often, &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is much less than &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt;.
* View &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; as a constant. Doing so simplifies the calculation of the time complexity.

We describe two algorithms:

* The two algorithms have similar steps at the start and end.
* Algorithm 1 considers one end date.
** Input: market days, start date, end date, and number of best market days to miss.
** Output: A number: How much you lose if you miss the best market days from the start date to the end date.
** Time complexity: &lt;math&gt;O(D \log D)&lt;/math&gt;.
* Algorithm 2 generalizes Algorithm 1. Algorithm 2 considers various end dates.
** Input: Same as Algorithm 1, except that we do not use an end date.
** Output: A list of numbers, indexed starting with 1, such that the value at index &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is how much you lose if you miss the best market days, in the first &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; market days. 
** Time complexity: &lt;math&gt;O(D \log D)&lt;/math&gt;. However, we can decrease this to &lt;math&gt;O(D)&lt;/math&gt;, if we assume that the input file has sorted the market days from early to recent. If the input file has the market days in reverse, then, we can reverse them in &lt;math&gt;O(D)&lt;/math&gt; time. Consequently, the time complexity does not change.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' are designed to perform well in most market conditions. Most contain a small number of low-cost funds that are easy to [[Rebalancing|rebalance]]. They are "lazy" in that you can maintain the same [[Asset allocation|asset allocation]] for an extended period, as they generally contain 30-40% [[Bond basics|bonds]], suitable for most pre-retirement investors.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Paul B. Farrell, who writes MarketWatch columns about various simple portfolios, popularized the term 'Lazy portfolios'.&lt;/ref&gt;

You can find historical performance for many of the "lazy portfolios" on our site's blog. See [https://www.bogleheads.org/blog/portfolios/ Portfolios - Bogleheads® blog].

==Two-fund portfolio==
You can invest in [[Domestic/International|broad US and International markets]], as well as bonds, using only two funds. [[Rick Ferri]] proposed a two-fund portfolio containing the total world stock market, and a diversified US bond market index fund as follows.&lt;ref name="Rick Ferri Index Portfolios"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/rickferri/2013/05/23/three-simple-index-fund-portfolios/?sh=4cf6fb5d2c15| title=Three simple index fund portfolios|publisher=Forbes|date=May 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Expense ratios]] are shown in parentheses.

==Three-fund lazy portfolios==
{{Main|Three-fund portfolio}}
A number of popular authors and columnists have suggested [[Three-fund_portfolio|three-fund]] lazy portfolios. These usually consist of three equal parts of bonds (total bond market or TIPS), total US market and total international market. While the "% allocation" is different from those listed below, these funds typically make up the core of Vanguard's [[Vanguard target retirement funds|Target Retirement]] and [[Vanguard_LifeStrategy_funds|Lifestrategy]] funds. [[Expense ratios]] are shown in parentheses.

In addition, there are several close alternatives to these funds, especially when purchasing through Vanguard. For example, the "Vanguard Inflation-Protected Securities Fund" also has a short term alternative, "Vanguard Short-Term Inflation-Protected Securities Index Fund" (tickers [{{Vf | 1967}} VTIPX] or [{{Vf | 0567}} VTAPX]) which can offer slightly less volatility in NAV.

[[Rick Ferri | Rick]] proposes that investors first determine their bond allocation.

[[Rick Ferri | Rick]] stresses that the exact allocation percentages are not important; to the nearest 5% is fine.&lt;ref name="Core Four" /&gt;

The Core Four is just a low cost foundation for your portfolio. You could add a slice of value stocks (US and/or International). You could split the bond portion between Treasury Inflation Protected Securities and nominal bonds, which would result in a slightly more conservative version of [[#David Swensen's lazy portfolio|David Swensen's model portfolio]] (less international stock and less REIT, but otherwise the same four base funds plus TIPS.

==More lazy portfolios==
Beyond the simple three- and four-fund lazy portfolios are more complex portfolios. These are still "lazy" in that they contain enough bonds (typically 30-40%) to allow you to maintain the same [[asset allocation]] for much of your accumulation phase. The more complex funds add REITs, and [[Slice and dice |'slice and dice']] the US and/or International stocks, adding large and small value to the mix. In some of the cases outlined below, a simpler portfolio can accomplish similar goals. For example, you can [[Value tilting - stock |'tilt']] away from a total stock market fund by adding a small cap value fund.

===Bill Schultheis's "Coffeehouse" portfolio===

[[Bill Schultheis]] made this simple seven-fund portfolio popular in his book [[Special:BookSources/978-0-9765857-0-1|''The Coffeehouse Investor'']]. He advocates 40% in a total market bond fund and 10% each in various stock funds. You can find more information at [https://www.coffeehouseinvestor.com/coffeehouse-beans/coffeehouse-portfolios/ The Coffeehouse Investor]. The Coffeehouse Portfolio contains only 10% international stocks (17% of total equities). It slices up the domestic portion, but uses a total international fund.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Discussed in {{ forum link | t = 43345 | title = Three Index Funds vs "The Coffeehouse Portfolio" ? | author = Shaoya | date = September 20, 2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===William Bernstein's "Coward's" portfolio===

He introduced the [http://www.efficientfrontier.com/ef/996/cowards.htm Coward's Portfolio] in 1996. The "coward" refers not to risk tolerance but to the strategy of hedging your bets and having slices of a number of asset classes. This portfolio is similar to the Coffeehouse Portfolio, except that it uses short term bonds, and divides the international portion into equal slices of Europe, Pacific and [[Emerging market stocks|Emerging markets]].

===Frank Armstrong's "Ideal Index" portfolio===
Frank Armstrong, author of [[Special:BookSources/978-0-8144-7250-7|''The Informed Investor'']], proposed this portfolio in an [https://moneycentral.msn.com/content/P128311.asp MSN Money article]{{dead link}}. It contains a smaller allocation to bonds, and a much larger allocation to international stocks (in fact the equities, excluding REIT, are split 50/50 between domestic and international). Like Bernstein he advocates short term bonds. If the domestic slices were replaced by a total market fund, this portfolio would be very close to the three-fund portfolios, with a slice of REIT added.

==Permanent Portfolio==
{{See also| Craig Rowland|J. M. Lawson}}
Free-market investment analyst Harry Browne devised the Permanent Portfolio in the 1980s, as a buy-and-hold portfolio that contains a healthy allocation to gold. The portfolio holds equal allocations of domestic stocks, gold, short-term treasury bonds, and long term treasury bonds.&lt;ref&gt;[https://earlyretirementextreme.com/wiki/index.php?title=Permanent_Portfolio Permanent Portfolio - Early Retirement Extreme Wiki]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group = "note"&gt;Discussed in {{ forum link | t = 15434 | title = Updated Modification of Harry Browne Permanent Portfolio | author = allenmickers | date = Mar 26, 2008}} and {{ forum link | t = 61964 | title = Harry Browne Permanent Portfolio Discussion (Cont'd) | date = Oct 23, 2010 | author = MediumTex}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Forum members [[Craig Rowland]] and [[J. M. Lawson]] have written a book, [[Special:BookSources/978-1-118-28825-2|''The Permanent Portfolio: Harry Browne's Long-Term Investment Strategy'']], detailing every aspect of the Permanent Portfolio.

You can build this portfolio with an investment in a low cost US total stock market index fund, along with direct investments in gold bullion coins, US treasury bills, and US treasury bonds. Or alternatively, with low-cost [[Exchange-traded funds| exchange-traded funds]].

      <text bytes="14150" sha1="f6nwviz9sxqavu6tplwpp33zy8d7x39" xml:space="preserve">An '''{{PAGENAME}} (IPS)''' is a statement that defines your general investment goals and objectives. It describes the strategies that you will use to meet these objectives, and contains specific information on subjects such as [[asset allocation]], [[risk]] tolerance, and liquidity requirements.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;For an interactive course on creating an investment policy statement, see: {{cite web| url=https://classroom.morningstar.com/classroom/investing/collection/portfolios/level/100/course/MORN-C870425758?page=1| title=Creating Your Investment Policy Statement| publisher=Morningstar's Investing Classroom| accessdate=June 5, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, you could consider using a simpler ''investing plan'' (see [[#Investing plan |below]]):
*If you find creating a full Investment Policy Statement too complex
*If your investment objectives do not justify the effort needed to create an Investment Policy Statement

== Benefits of using an IPS ==
Every investor could potentially benefit from having an investment policy statement. It provides the foundation for all your future investment decisions. It serves as a guidepost, identifies goals and creates a systematic review process. The IPS aims to keep you focused on your objectives during short-term swings in the market, and gives you a baseline from which to monitor investment performance of your overall portfolio, as well as the performance of individual fund managers.

If you are using some sort of financial advisor, an IPS outlines the ground rules of the relationship between you and that advisor. And you can use the IPS as a reference to see whether or not your portfolio is achieving your stated goals and objectives. You can also use your IPS to evaluate and review any proposed changes to your investments against your overall objectives.

A properly constructed Investment Policy Statement supports following a well-conceived, long-term investment discipline, rather than one that is based on false overconfidence or panic in reaction to short-term market fluctuations.

== Drawbacks of not using an IPS ==
Someone without a written policy often bases decisions on day-to-day events, which regularly leads to chasing short-term performance that may hinder them in reaching long-term goals. Having a policy encourages you to maintain focus on the long-term nature of investing, especially during turbulent or exuberant times.

== Basic sections of an IPS ==
=== Financial account information ===
This area includes:
* Where are your financial assets located?
* How much is in tax-advantaged accounts ([[IRA]], [[Roth IRA]], [[401(k)]], etc) versus taxable accounts?
* How much will you be contributing to these accounts?

=== Investment objectives, time horizon, and risk tolerance ===
Here you list the following:
* Your short-term financial goals and liquidity needs
* Your long-term financial goals and retirement
** Your time-frame for funding these goals
** The length of time for which you will need these assets
** Amount of assets required

=== Asset classes to use and those to avoid ===
For example:
* [[Asset class]]es you decide that you must include in your overall investment portfolio
** U.S. Stocks
** International Stocks
** U.S. Bonds
* Asset classes you would rather avoid due to excessive risk, high expenses, or large tax liabilities, and so on. For example:
** Hedge funds
** Actively-managed funds with high taxable turnover or distributions
** Consider under-weighting tech sector due to my employment there

=== Asset allocation targets and rebalancing ranges ===
This area lists the following:
* Your target allocation between [[stock]]s and [[bond]]s
* Your target allocation for international investments
* Any time-frame for altering these allocations
* The minimum and maximum deviations from these targets that will trigger portfolio [[rebalancing]]

=== Monitoring and control procedures ===
Here you list:
* Your frequency of monitoring
* Your benchmark for comparison of portfolio returns
* The acceptable deviation from benchmark (amount and time)
* Any concrete procedures for future changes to IPS, for example:
** Financial reasons for changing IPS
** Lifestyle reasons for changing IPS
** Any reasons ''not'' to change IPS (for example, short-term market performance)

== Example IPS ==

{| class="wikitable"
|+ Example IPS
|- 
! style="text-align:left;" | Investment objectives:
|These are my main objectives for my investment program. I have developed them after a review of my financial resources, financial goals, asset allocation, risk tolerance and time horizon.
* Objective 1: To retire at the age of 57
* Objective 2: To have an annual income from my investments of at least $45,000 after taxes and in today’s dollars (inflation assumed to be 3.0 percent yearly)
* Objective 3: To leave a meaningful inheritance for my children
* Objective 4: To minimize potential tax liabilities
* Objective 5: To monitor portfolio allocation against holding limits, to benchmark returns against expectations, and to consider revisions to portfolio as personal situation may dictate
|-
! style="text-align:left;" | Risk tolerance:
|My ability to tolerate the uncertainties, complexities and volatility inherent in the investment markets has been considered in the development of this investment program. The main factors that have influenced my risk tolerance and asset allocation are: age, present financial condition, specific financial goals, discretionary income and its variability, past investment experience.
|-
! style="text-align:left;" | Holding limits:
|My portfolio was developed subject to certain holding limitations. These are limitations on the minimum and maximum percentage investment in each asset class:
* Large Cap U.S. Equities (15-30 percent)
* Mid Cap U.S. Equities (10-25 percent) 
* Small Cap U.S. Equities (5-15 percent)
* Foreign Equities (5-15 percent)
* REITs (0-15 percent)
* Inter-Term Govt Bonds (10-25 percent)
* Corporate Bonds (0-10 percent)
* Cash and Cash Equivalents (5-20 percent)
|-
! style="text-align:left;" | Target allocation:
|Based on my financial resources, financial goals, time horizon, tax status, holding limitations, risk tolerance and [[Historical and Expected Returns| expected investment performance]] a recommended portfolio was determined. The portfolio balances risk and reward and attempts to achieve the stated objectives of the investment program. The initial asset allocation is:
* Large Cap U.S. Equities (25 percent)
* Mid Cap U.S. Equities (10 percent)
* Small Cap U.S. Equities (5 percent)
* Foreign Equities (15 percent)
* REITs (10 percent)
* Inter-Term Govt Bonds (25 percent)
* Corporate Bonds (5 percent)
* Cash Equivalents (5 percent)
|-
! style="text-align:left;" | Selection criteria:
|Investment portfolios used to implement the investment program shall be subject to specified selection criteria and shall be monitored for adherence to my investment policy guidelines, major changes in the portfolios and comparative performance with similar investments. The [[Expense ratios |expense ratio]] and overall cost of funds shall be a major point in the selection criteria. To minimize style drift, index funds are preferred, if available, for all asset class.
|-
! style="text-align:left;" | Review process:
|My investment performance will be monitored and reported on a quarterly basis and will be compared against the appropriate benchmarks. The investment program will be reviewed at least annually to make sure that it continues to achieve his stated objectives. Since this investment program is long-term in nature, the periodic adjustments made to his investment program should be small.
|-
! style="text-align:left;" | Rebalancing:
|The percentage weighting to each asset class within the investment portfolio will vary. The percentage weighting within each asset class will be allowed to vary within a reasonable range of plus or minus an absolute 5 percent or 25 percent of the original allocation amount; whichever is triggered first. To minimize taxable events when rebalancing is required, dividends and net cash inflows will be used to meet the strategic asset allocation targets. If cash flow is not sufficient to meet the target allocation for an asset class, I will decide whether to effect transactions in order to rebalance the asset allocation.

== Real-world IPS ==
Fellow Boglehead [https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=681 Sunny] was one of the first to post a popular IPS. It may not cover all of the topics necessary for someone with a complicated financial situation, but his IPS is brilliant in its elegance and compactness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://socialize.morningstar.com/NewSocialize/asp/FullConv.asp?forumId=F100000015&amp;convId=183427| title=Diehard Sunny Sarkar's beautiful IPS| author=Taylor Larimore| author-link=Taylor Larimore| date=September 18, 2006| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220621234414/https://socialize.morningstar.com/NewSocialize/asp/FullConv.asp?forumId=F100000015&amp;convId=183427| archive-date=June 21, 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

! style="text-align:left;" | Investment philosophy:
|''"Buy-and-hold, long-term, all-market-index strategies, implemented at rock-bottom cost, are the surest of all routes to the accumulation of wealth"'' - John C. Bogle
|-
! style="text-align:left;" | Asset allocation:
|Maintain overall 60% stock + 40% fixed-income allocation until home purchase to accommodate both short-term and long-term requirements. Assets should be diversified across major asset classes including domestic equity, international equity (20-25% of equities), conventional bonds of short to intermediate term, and TIPS (50% of fixed).
|-
! style="text-align:left;" | Funds and accounts:
|Use low cost mutual funds - index funds preferably - which do not overlap and provide maximum diversification across asset classes. Try to assume only market risk as far as possible. Try to shelter tax-inefficient funds in tax-advantaged accounts to reduce tax drag.
|-
! style="text-align:left;" | Target allocation:
|
* VTSMX - Total Stock Market Fund 45% - Taxable account
* VGTSX - Total Int'l Market Fund 15% - Roth IRA
* VIPSX - TIPS Fund 20% - Traditional IRA
* IIBAX - Intermediate Bond Fund 20% - 401k
* VMMXX - Money Market fund (6 months' expenses) - Taxable account 
|-
! style="text-align:left;" | Other considerations:
|Automate future contributions wherever possible. Rebalance yearly. No market timing. Exact sub-allocations are not as important as maintaining the overall 60/40 stock/fixed allocation - no need to make things complex in order to meet sub-allocation targets.

==Investing plan==
In some cases, a ''formal'' investing policy statement may seem too complicated or inconvenient. In that case, you could develop an informal ''investing plan'' (also referred to as an ''investment plan'') instead. Whether it is called a policy or a plan, the idea is that you have a clear understanding of managing your investment goals and objectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Forum link| t=69802| title=EmergDoc's Investing Plan Thread}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bogleheads forum often gets questions such as "I have $50K saved up and I need to know which funds to put it in!". Setting up an investing plan will help answer these questions.

An investing plan can be as easy as following these simple steps:
*''Step 1'' - Formulate your goals. Be as specific as possible, realizing that you will make changes as the years go by.
*''Step 2'' - Set up a plan for each goal. The plan consists of identifying what type of account you will use to save the money, choosing the amount you will put toward the goal each year, working out an asset allocation likely to reach the goal with the minimum risk necessary, and identifying a plan B for the goal in case the returns you are planning on do not materialize.
*''Step 3'' - Select the best (usually lowest cost) investments to fulfill your desired asset allocation. Using all or mostly index funds further simplifies the process.

Some typical goals that can benefit from an investing plan:
*I want $40,000 for home downpayment by June 30, 2030
*I want to have enough money to pay the tuition at my alma mater in 13 years when my 5 year old turns 18
*I want to have $2&amp;nbsp;million saved for retirement by Jan 1 2050

You should look at all of your accounts as a unified portfolio to construct a portfolio that is low cost, well diversified, and tax efficient. If this concept is new to you, you might feel overwhelmed by the complexity of maintaining such a portfolio. '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is intended to suggest one way of making things easier.

==Asset allocation==
One of the easiest ways to maintain your portfolio is to categorize by [[asset allocation]]. For example:
{| class=wikitable style="text-align:center" width=570px
! Account
! Domestic&lt;br&gt;stocks
! REITs
! International&lt;br&gt;stocks
! Bonds
! Total
|-
! Taxable
| -
| -
| $14,000
| -
| $14,000
|-
! Roth IRA
| -
|  $9,000
|  $9,000
| -
| $18,000
|-
! 401(k)
|  $49,000
| -
| -
|  $19,000
|  $68,000
|-
! Total
|  $49,000
|  $9,000
|  $23,000
|  $19,000
|  $100,000
|-
! Desired
|  $48,000
|  $8,000
|  $24,000
|   $20,000
|  $100,000
|-
! Difference
|  ($1,000)
| ($1,000)
|   $1,000
|   $1,000
|  -
|}

* You manually enter cells in the rows for Taxable, [[Roth IRA]], and [[401(k)]]. All other cells can be automatically calculated.
* Each cell in the Total row represents the total amount of domestic [[stock]]s, that of [[real estate investment trust]]s (REITs), and so on.
* The Desired row represents the desired amount of dollars in each [[asset class]]. You can calculate this by multiplying the value of your portfolio by the percentages in your target asset allocation.
* The Difference row tells you how far off your portfolio is relative to your desired asset allocation. You can calculate it by subtracting a cell in the Total row from the corresponding cell in the Desired row.

===Sample spreadsheets===
* Here is [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1E28C1YTb1jzi3hSKK3ABGvWgTmjSlO5W/edit?usp=sharing&amp;ouid=103809420707053067543&amp;rtpof=true&amp;sd=true a sample spreadsheet] and [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AdNNA8LuYbRyeomrjqLrj9rOvnlWF_xE/view?usp=sharing documentation] in Google Drive in this style. It includes the additional features above, and can also adjust for the different after-tax value of assets in different accounts, and combine multiple subclasses into one class (so that you may have a target allocation to foreign stocks, and separate targets for developed and emerging markets). A [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jY8AdbIF2Xm4Tdq_z2YAf2Zxd42xxUvh/edit?usp=sharing&amp;ouid=103809420707053067543&amp;rtpof=true&amp;sd=true simpler version] is also available. This version does not track subclasses.
* One important aspect of of maintaining your asset allocation is to do periodic [[rebalancing]]. A sample rebalancing spreadsheet is available from [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AsVSNcUR-B6IdE4tZm0yVk9ObkxsZ2xvNmJpRTB0b0E Google Drive] (by forum member LadyGeek).&lt;ref group="note"&gt;To download, select File --&gt; Download As --&gt; Excel or OpenDocument.&lt;/ref&gt; It uses three example approaches, which you could incorporate into any of the sample spreadsheets.

Support is in {{Forum link|t=451043|title=A Free Google Sheet for Asset Allocation Tracking}}.

===Suggested improvements===
* You might want to make a separate Target row to keep track of your target allocation. In that case, the Desired row would be the product of the Target row and the total portfolio.
* Similarly, you might make an Actual row to compute your percentage allocation, so that you could compare your target percentages to your actual percentages.
* If you have funds which cover multiple asset classes, you can put each fund in a different row, make an extra column for the total fund value, and have the spreadsheet automatically compute the amount of the fund which is in each class.  This allows you to easily track the effect on your allocation of adding $10,000 to a balanced fund.

===Asset allocation visualized===
[[The Finance Buff]]'s article, [http://thefinancebuff.com/cascading-asset-allocation-method.html Cascading Asset Allocation Method], describes how to select a portfolio's asset allocation by visualizing the process as a top-down hierarchy. The most important selection is at the top (stocks/bonds), which then breaks down into smaller asset classes. Selection of the actual funds is done last, which is at the bottom of the chart. Two spreadsheets are available.

First, forum member 'pradador' has created a spreadsheet which allows you to create a portfolio by following the advice in the article. The spreadsheet is available on Google Drive: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AsVSNcUR-B6IdEJZNE43NHpKQnNPNXFUTk1CZ195dmc Cascading Asset Allocation] (The spreadsheet was further modified by forum member LadyGeek to include error checking.)&lt;ref&gt;{{Forum link| t=106505| title=Cascading Asset Allocation Spreadsheet| author=pradador| date=December 5, 2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

This spreadsheet includes a [[Fixed income | fixed income]] major asset category, which is not mentioned in the article. There is no consensus on the role of fixed income in a portfolio; this depends on your situation. If you consider ''fixed income'' as a bond, then set the percentage of Fixed Income to 0.

There are two tabs:
*Top Down: Starting on the left side and proceed to the right, enter your desired asset allocations to arrive at the percentage of each fund's contribution to your portfolio. The bottom row is reserved for error checking. If you make an entry (the percentages do not add up to 100%), you will see an error message.
*Bottom Up: Use this tab to determine the asset allocation percentages of your portfolio when you know the funds. In the right-most column, enter the percentages and funds. The spreadsheet will work left and arrive at the asset allocations. The blank cell in the lower right-most corner will display an error if the percentage does not add up to 100%.

====How to use a proxy fund====
Google Finance offers historical and real-time securities information using the {{code|GoogleFinance()}} function in Google Sheets.

If you have funds held in a [[Collective Investment Trusts|Collective Investment Trust (CIT)]], in which there is no ticker symbol, then you can use a proxy fund to keep your balance roughly up to date using the GoogleFinance functions in Google spreadsheets.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Proxy fund: A fund used to represent another fund. The C-fund does not have a ticker symbol. In its place, the Vanguard Institutional Index Fund (VINIX) is used to represent the C-fund. The Vanguard fund is the proxy for the C-fund.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, suppose you hold the government's [[Thrift Savings Plan]] C Fund, which is a collective investment trust (CIT) that tracks the S&amp;P 500 index. Find out the closing price of the CIT on the current day, and also find a similar proxy fund, such as Vanguard's institutional index fund (VINIX).

For example, suppose the C Fund's closing price is $23.6602 and Vanguard's VINIX is $167.75. This means that a share of the C Fund is worth 7.08 times a share of VINIX (167.75/23.6602).

To maintain a real-time estimate of your C Fund balance without needing to update the C Fund's share price every day, you can instead take the daily price of VINIX and divide it by the multiplier to get an approximate share price for the C Fund.

For example, these could be the cell along a row in your spreadsheet and this is what you would enter into them.

{| class=wikitable style="text-align:left" 
|+ Implementing a proxy fund
! Cell
! Heading
! Enter
! Notes
|-
| A2
| Shares
| 100
| Enter the number of shares you have in the Collective Index Trust (CIT). As you add or subtract shares from contributions, withdrawals or exchanges, you will need to periodically update this amount.
|-
| B2
| Closing Price
| 23.6602
| Enter the CIT's closing price. You will need to look this up in your plan.
|-
| C2
| Close Date
| 01/03/2014
| Enter the closing date on which you got the "Closing Price" of the CIT in B2. Make sure you enter the date and closing price are in sync, and be sure that the closing price has been updated in case there is a lag between the market close and the posting of the closing prices.
|-
| D2
| Proxy Fund
| VINIX
| Enter the ticker of a fund that is similar to your CIT.
|-
| E2
| Proxy Price
| =INDEX(GoogleFinance(D2, "close", C2); 2; 2)
| This returns the closing price of the proxy fund you selected in D2, on the date C2, which is the same date you recorded the closing price of the CIT.
|-
| F2
| Multiplier
| =E2/B2
| This is the ratio of the Proxy Fund's Price divided by your CIT's price, on the same date.
|-
| G2
| Proxy Fund Current Price
| =GoogleFinance(D2, "price")
| The current price of your proxy fund.
|-
| H2
| CIT Approx Price
| =G2/F2
| This is the approximate calculated share price of the CIT.
|-
| I2
| Balance
| =H2*A2
| The approximate balance you hold in the CIT. This is the approximated price of the CIT multiplied by the number of shares you hold in the CIT.
|-
|}
To keep this reasonably up-to-date and to prevent the "multiplier" from drifting over time, you can periodically replace the date in cell C2 and the actual closing price of the CIT in cell B2.

====Real-time tracking from a website====
Another technique is to find a website that outputs the price of the trust in real-time (or near real-time) and then use the GoogleFinance {{code|ImportHmtl()}} function to "scrape" the HTML from the page.

If the {{code|ImportHtml()}} function can scrape that data cleanly into defined rows and columns with the price landing in a single cell, then you can then use the {{code|INDEX}} function to get the value of a particular cell by referencing its row and column. The Bogleheads forum shows two examples:

*{{Forum link| t=141547| title=GoogleFinance price quotes for TSP Funds}}
*{{Forum link| t=141501| title=How to import TIAA-CREF annuity unit values into Google Docs}}

==Rate of return==
{{See also| Comparing investments#Internal rate of return| Calculating personal returns}}

[[Calculating personal returns]] offers a spreadsheet to calculate investor and portfolio returns. It lets Bogleheads report their personal returns in a uniform manner.

If you know the dates you made your investment contributions and your withdrawals, the {{code|XIRR}} (Internal Rate of Return) spreadsheet function is the best and most accurate method for calculating your rate of return. This method is far more accurate than annual average returns, as contributions and withdrawals (cash flows) are weighted for both time and value.&lt;ref&gt;{{Forum link| t=51221| title=Using XIRR in Excel| date=March 3, 2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;''Internal'' refers to the fact that its calculation does not incorporate environmental factors, for example, the interest rate or inflation. For more, see [[wikipedia:Internal rate of return |Internal rate of return]], from Wikipedia&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Forum link| t=115030 |title=XIRR function again}} has details and a working example.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;{{Forum link| t=115030| title=XIRR function again}} also describes a bug in MS Excel's {{code|XIRR()}} function. This bug is not present in LibreOffice or Google Drive Sheets.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tax lot tracking==
Another use of a spreadsheet is to keep track of share lots in a taxable account, so that you can automatically compute the capital gain or loss when you sell, and easily see which shares should be sold for [[tax loss harvesting]] or to minimize the tax cost of selling. A spreadsheet for tax lots could look like this: 

{| class=wikitable style="text-align:center"
! Date&lt;br&gt;bought
! Amount&lt;br&gt;invested
! Share&lt;br&gt;price
! Shares
! Date&lt;br&gt;sold
! Share&lt;br&gt;price
! Amount&lt;br&gt;received
! Capital&lt;br&gt;gain
|-

| $5000 
| $20.00 
| 250.000 
| 10/31/08 
| $15.00 
| $3750 
| -$1250
|-
| 5/1/08 
| $5000 
| $18.00 
| 277.778

|-
| 7/1/10

| $30.00 
| 333.333
| 2/1/11 
| $33.00 
| $11000 
| $1000
|}

===Sample spreadsheets===
* Here are three versions of a spreadsheet for tracking tax lots, and computing the capital gains and losses on each sale.  There is a version for [https://web.archive.org/web/20190117214306/http://remarque.org/~grabiner/stockworksheet.xls stocks or ETFs], [https://web.archive.org/web/20190225201418/http://remarque.org/~grabiner/mutualfundworksheet.xls most mutual funds], and [http://remarque.org/~grabiner/fundwithfees.xls funds with purchase and redemption fees]. In a brokerage account, you would make one sheet in a workbook for each holding. The worksheets adjust for stock splits and share class conversions, but if you sell part of a lot, you have to split the lot into two purchases manually.

==Portfolio tools==
{{Main article|Tools and calculators#Portfolio tools|l1= Portfolio tools}}
In addition to the spreadsheets there are various utilities to design and manage portfolios that span multiple accounts. Most tools cannot automatically compose your ideal portfolio, but you can use the tools to enter two or three models that you composed, and then you can compare and contrast the results, looking in particular at the blended expense ratios and the totals of each asset class. 
Two popular tools are: 
*[[Vanguard Portfolio Watch]] is an online tool for Vanguard clients to track asset allocation. 
*[[Tools_and_calculators#Portfolio_tools| Morningstar Instant X-Ray]] is a tool especially useful for breaking down a portfolio into asset allocations and style boxes. Requires a free subscription to use.

      <text bytes="10260" sha1="2q28kx47v2ei5pn0tvnv4a47301qn3z" xml:space="preserve">'''{{PAGENAME}}''' brings a [[portfolio]] that has deviated away from its target [[asset allocation]] back into line. The idea is that maintaining a consistent mix of [[asset class]]es (most commonly [[equities]] and [[fixed income]]) will help to keep risk at the desired level.

You do this by transferring funds from higher-performing classes to lower-performing classes. Although this may seem counterintuitive, rebalancing ensures that investors "Buy Low" and "Sell High".

==Example==
* You own two funds (Fund A and Fund B). The funds could be either [[mutual fund]]s, [[index fund]]s or [[exchange-traded fund]]s (ETFs).
* You have a $10,000 portfolio and have selected an asset allocation such that each fund represents 50% of the total ($5,000 each)
* Over time, Fund A rises in value to $6000 while Fund B declines in value to $4,000 - you now have a 60/40 split instead of 50/50
* To maintain your asset allocation, you would rebalance your portfolio by taking $1,000 from Fund A and transferring it to Fund B
* After this, your asset allocation is once again 50/50

==Different rebalancing approaches==
There are several ways you can determine when it is time to rebalance:
* At a certain point in the calendar (for example, the beginning of the year, a specific day of the year, every other year, and so on). For example, you might systematically rebalance your portfolio once a year, on your birthday.
* When asset classes deviate from their target by a specific ''absolute percentage''. For example, if your target asset allocation is 60% equities and 40% fixed income and your (absolute) rebalancing threshold is +/-&amp;nbsp;5%, you would rebalance your portfolio when your portfolio reaches (65% equities / 35% fixed income) or (55% equities / 45% fixed income).&lt;ref group="note" name="5/25"&gt;[[Larry Swedroe]] uses a "5/25 rule" which works like this:
*'''Absolute percentage of 5% for allocations 20% or greater:''' When asset classes deviate from their target by an ''absolute'' percentage of 5%. For example, if your target asset allocation is 60% equities and 40% fixed income, you would rebalance your portfolio when your portfolio reaches (65% equities / 35% fixed income) or (55% equities / 45% fixed income).
*'''Relative percentage of 25% for allocations less than 20%:''' When asset classes deviate from their target by a ''relative'' percentage of 25%. For example, if your target equities asset allocation is 60%, composed of 45% Total Stock Market and 15% Total International, you would rebalance Total International if it changes by more than +/-&amp;nbsp;3.75% (25% of 15%).

* When asset classes deviate from their target by a certain ''relative percentage''. For example, if your target equities asset allocation is 60%, composed of 40% Total Stock Market and 20% Total International, and your (relative) rebalancing threshold is +/-&amp;nbsp;25%, you would rebalance International if it changes by more than +/- 5% (25% of 20%).&lt;ref group="note" name="5/25" /&gt;
* When asset classes deviate from their target by a certain dollar amount. For example, if you hold $6,000 in equities and $4,000 in fixed income and your rebalancing threshold is +/-&amp;nbsp;$1,000, you would rebalance your portfolio when either of your holdings deviates from their target asset allocation of 60% equities / 40% fixed income by at least $1,000.
* When contributing to or withdrawing from your portfolio. For example, if your target allocation is 60% equities and 40% fixed income, you hold $7,000 of equities and $3,000 of fixed income, and you wish to contribute $1,000 to your portfolio, you would simply buy $1,000 worth of fixed income assets. This would bring you to an allocation of 64% equities / 36% fixed income. This approach minimizes transaction costs, effort, and taxes. This [https://optimalrebalancing.info portfolio rebalancing calculator] can help in cases where it is not obvious how much of a new contribution or withdrawal to allocate to each asset.

==Other considerations==
* Think about transaction costs when deciding whether or not to rebalance. Because transactions often have costs associated with them, many investors choose to wait for their portfolio to pass a significant threshold of deviation (whether defined by percentage or dollars) before rebalancing.
* Investors often find it difficult "selling winners" to "buy losers". To help remove emotions from the decision, you might choose a specific date to rebalance (for example, birthday, tax day, and so on). Investors who find the prospect daunting may want to consider [[Vanguard target retirement funds]], which automatically rebalance as necessary to maintain a consistent asset allocation.
* The frequency with which you check your portfolio for deviations from its target has some influence on the returns gains (or losses) that rebalancing generates.&lt;ref group="note" name="frequency"&gt;Research seems to indicate that checking weekly (while actually rebalancing very infrequently, for example by using large deviation thresholds) could provide the best rebalancing bonus. Conversely, rebalancing too frequently and using low thresholds would be detrimental. See: [https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/57f8/766d83249e5be740c6cdacc8b30f8a5277cd.pdf Opportunistic Rebalancing: A New Paradigm For Wealth Managers], Gobind Daryanani.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modified approaches==
If you worry about rebalancing into a sustained bear market, one of these modifications to standard rebalancing methods might be useful:
* Keep a floor level of bonds, that is, once the total amount of bonds has dropped to a fixed amount, stop rebalancing into stocks.
* Only rebalance out of stocks, never into stocks.

==Estimating changes in asset allocation==
Normal market fluctuations do not frequently trigger rebalancing. For example, shifting the balance of a 50/50 portfolio by 1% requires a 4% change in the price of stocks relative to bonds.

All other portfolios are less sensitive, with 70/30 or 30/70 requiring a 5% change, 80/20 or 20/80 a 6% change, and 90/10 or 10/90 an 11% change. For example, a $10,000 60/40 portfolio will, after a 10% stock market drop, have $6,000 * 0.9 = $5,400 in stocks and $4,000 in bonds, for a stock allocation of $5,400 / ($5,400 + $4,000) = 57.45%, a 2.55% shift.

The concept of portfolio '''value tilting''' is intended for &lt;u&gt;advanced investors&lt;/u&gt;. Tilting is not recommended for new investors, as it ''intentionally deviates'' from investing in the total market- a Bogleheads' approach to managing your portfolio.
}}

==Background==
{{Quote
|quote = '''John Bogle on tilting''':&lt;br&gt;"Impressed both by the long-term performance (and recent performance) of value stocks and small-cap stocks, some investors hold the all-market (or S&amp;P 500) index fund as the core, and add a value index fund and a small-cap index fund as satellites. I'm skeptical that any kind of superior performance will endure forever. (Nothing does!) But if you disagree, it would not be unreasonable to hold, say, 85 percent in the core, another 10 percent in value, and another 5 percent in small cap. But doing so increases the risk that your return will fall short of the market's return, so don't push too far."

Financial experts&lt;ref&gt;See John Bogle, [https://personal.vanguard.com/bogle_site/sp20020626.html The Telltale Chart]&lt;/ref&gt; often recommend that investors should use index mutual funds to invest in entire markets, or, invest in funds that approximate the total market. Other portfolio theorists advise holding portfolios that tilt toward small and value stocks.&lt;ref&gt;Eugene Fama Jr., [http://www.dfaus.com/2009/05/the-new-indexing.html The New Indexing], July 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Truman A. Clark, [http://www.dfaus.com/2009/05/the-dimensions-of-stock-returns-2007.html The Dimensions of Stock Returns], September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; 
One popular way to analyze the stock market is to subdivide it into 3 levels of [[Market Capitalization | market capitalization]] and 3 [[Stock Basics#Style | styles]], resulting in a 3 x 3 "style" box. As defined in the style box for VTSMX&lt;ref&gt;[{{Vf | 0085}} Vanguard's Total Stock Market Index Fund (VTSMX)] approximates the total market by investing in over 3,000 stocks, which is representative of the whole U.S. market&lt;/ref&gt;, the majority of the US Market (the Total Stock Market or "TSM") is held in large caps. Therefore, this fund (representing the US Market, or the "Market") is defined as a "''cap weighted''" market.
&lt;center&gt;

The intent is that these distribution percentages, by definition, accurately represent the composition of the entire market. Gain and loss over time represents the movement of the market as a whole.

If you invest $1.00 in a total market index fund, each stock receives the same amount of your dollar in proportion to its cap weight. The largest stock gets 100 times the amount of a company 100th its size. Therefore, no company gets more or less than that determined by its market capitalization.

==Tilting==
Tilting is defined as any deviation (change) from the Total Stock Market distribution percentages as previously defined.

Historically, value stocks and small stocks have provided higher returns than large blend and growth stocks (in both domestic and foreign markets). The theoretical basis posited for these higher returns states that small stocks and value stocks are riskier than large and growth stocks, and that the higher returns compensate investors for higher risk.&lt;ref&gt; Rolf W. Banz, "The Relationship Between Return and Market Value of Common Stocks," Journal of Financial Economics, 9 (1981), pp. 3-18 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Davis, James L., [[Eugene F. Fama]] and [[Kenneth R. French]], "Characteristics, Covariances, and Average Returns: 1929-1997" (February 1999). Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP) Working Paper No. 471. Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=98678 or DOI: 10.2139/ssrn.98678 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Eugene F. Fama]] and [[Kenneth R. French]], "Value Versus Growth: The International Evidence" (August 1997). Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=2358 or DOI: 10.2139/ssrn.2358 &lt;/ref&gt; Based on theory and past performance, some investors choose to add additional value and small stocks to their portfolios. Many investors who tilt employ what is termed a 4x25 allocation consisting of equal parts of 25% large blend; 25% large value; 25% small blend; and 25% small value. Tilters employ blend indexes for growth stock exposure in response to the long term performance of small cap growth stocks.&lt;ref&gt; [[William Bernstein]], [http://www.efficientfrontier.com/ef/499/scg.htm Small Cap Growth Indexing and the Multifactor Threestep],''Efficient Frontier'', April, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; [[William Bernstein]], [http://www.efficientfrontier.com/ef/701/sg.htm The Small-Growth Indexing Anomaly], ''Efficient Frontier'', Summer 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Other tilters, valuing greater portfolio simplicity, overweight small value stocks by adding a small value fund to the market portfolio.&lt;ref&gt;Sample portfolios using small cap tilts are included in [[Lazy Portfolios]]:
*[[Lazy Portfolios#Bill Schultheis's "Coffeehouse" Portfolio]]
*[[Lazy Portfolios#William Bernstein's "Coward's" Portfolio]]
*[[Lazy Portfolios#Frank Armstrong's "Ideal Index" Portfolio]]&lt;/ref&gt; Overweight means increasing your holdings to more than is naturally in the market profile. 

As an example, the Small cap styles represent 9% (3 + 3 + 3) of the total market. ''Tilting to Small'' means overweighting your portfolio to hold more than 9% of Small cap stocks.

==Considerations==
===Asset allocation===
Bogleheads author [[Larry Swedroe]] suggests that tilting to stocks with higher expected returns, such as small-cap and value, can allow the investor reduce overall equity exposure while maintaining the same expected return for the portfolio. Holding a smaller allocation to stocks and a larger allocation to bonds reduces "fat tail" risk; i.e., the risk of unexpected events that have a large negative impact on the overall stock market.

===Duration===
Tilted portfolios require long holding periods as the market, value, and size factor returns often rotate over time.&lt;ref&gt; [[William Bernstein]], [http://www.efficientfrontier.com/ef/700/factors.htm Factor Rotation], ''Efficient Frontier'', Summer 2000. &lt;/ref&gt;
===Investor behavior===
The investor's behavior during bear and bull markets can influence results. An investor who tilts must be able to hold to the allocation during periods when the tilted equity portfolio underperforms the market portfolio. An investor should also resist the temptation to engage in "performance chasing", that is buying or selling a size or style tilt based on recent performance.
===Rate of return===
Although small-cap and value stocks may have higher expected returns than large-cap and growth stocks, investors should recognize that the record of realized returns does not assure a similar pattern in the future. The timing and magnitude of the small and value premiums will always be uncertain, i.e. past performance does not predict future performance.

===Taxes===
In a taxable account, value funds have an additional tax cost, because they tend to have higher dividend yields. Rebalancing between multiple funds may also add to the tax cost if the rebalancing cannot be done with new money. Small-cap and value index funds are more likely to realize capital gains, although tax-managed funds and [[ETFs]] reduce this tax effect. Much of the extra tax cost can be avoided by [[Principles of Tax-Efficient Fund Placement|tax-efficient fund placement]] for an investor with both tax-advantaged and taxable accounts if the value funds can all be held in a tax-advantaged account.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' means dividing your allocation within a given single [[Asset class | asset class]], such as [[Stock basics |stocks]]. Adding asset classes to a portfolio ([[Bond basics |bonds]],&lt;ref group="note"&gt;A bond is not a unitary asset class, because the segments of the bond market (that is, [[Treasury bonds|treasuries]], [[Corporate bonds|corporates]], [[Municipal bonds|municipals]], [[Asset-backed securities|asset-backed]], [[Mortgage-backed securities|mortgage securities]], [[Treasury Inflation Protected Securities|inflation indexed securities]], [[Zero-coupon bond|zero coupon]]) are all discrete. However, this restriction has been dropped over time (refer to the "[[#Usage|Usage]]" section).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gold |gold]], [[Commodities|commodities]]) is [[Asset allocation|asset allocation]], not slicing and dicing. ''Slice and dice'' portfolios are essentially diversified portfolios that aim to beat the broad market index by systematically overweighting various sectors.&lt;ref name="telltale"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://johncbogle.com/speeches/JCB_Morningstar_6-02.pdf| title=The Telltale Chart| author=John Bogle| author-link=John Bogle| date=June 26, 2002| accessdate=January 5, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its simplest form, the idea is to obtain excess returns by holding a portfolio that:&lt;ref name="telltale"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Paraphrased from the original text, as suggested by Barry Barnitz. See the [[Talk:Slice and dice | discussion tab]] above.&lt;/ref&gt;
:a) splits the market portfolio among sub-asset classes that are deemed likely to deliver superior returns;
:b) holds higher weightings of size and value sub-asset classes that have lower correlations with the market; and
:c) periodically rebalances each sub-asset class to its original weight. 

This contrasts with ''total stock market'' investing, which approximates the entire market as a single asset class.

The theoretical justification for ''slice and dice'' rests on the benefits of what is often called "diversification". However, in this context the word is used with a specific technical meaning. It refers to asset classes with low correlation coefficients. The benefit comes from the fact that a mixture of assets with low correlation will have better risk-adjusted returns than either of them taken by itself. A well-known example is that even though [[Domestic/International |international stocks]] are riskier than domestic stocks, adding a moderate amount of international stocks to domestic stocks slightly reduces the risk of the domestic stocks.&lt;ref name="nisi"&gt;{{forum link| p=853767| title=What is "Slice and Dice"?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
''Slice and dice'' is based on research by [[Eugene F. Fama]] and [[Kenneth R. French]] in their 1992 paper, ''The Cross Section of Expected Stock Returns'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.ivey.uwo.ca/media/3775518/the_cross-section_of_expected_stock_returns.pdf| title=The Cross Section of Expected Stock Returns| author1=Eugene F. Fama| author1-link=Eugene F. Fama| author2-link=Kenneth R. French| author2=Kenneth R. French| publisher=The Journal of Finance| date=June 1992| accessdate=January 5, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt; which introduced the [[Fama and French three-factor model | three factor model]]. By the mid and latter part of the nineties, investment advisors and some individuals began considering, and then implementing, portfolios based on the market, size, and value factors, compared to holding a "market cap" US stock index portfolio, such as the [[S&amp;P 500 index]] or a Total Market index.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;This section is based on an email from Barry Barnitz.&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally, the portfolio most widely used for theoretical discussion was the 4x25 ''slice and dice'', based on the "four corners" (quadrants) of the Fama and French three factor world: large growth, large value, [[Small caps | small growth, and small value]]. These quadrants are created by splitting the stocks as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.efficientfrontier.com/ef/702/3FM-10.htm| title=The Cross-Section of Expected Stock Returns| author=William Bernstein| author1-link=William Bernstein| publisher=Efficient Frontier| accessdate=January 5, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Split vertically: "Large" is size deciles one through five of the CRSP (Center for Research in Security Prices) database,&lt;ref group="note" name="crsp" /&gt; and "Small," deciles six through ten.
*Split horizontally: "Value" and "Growth" are defined as the bottom and top 30% of stocks sorted by price/book.

Advisors and portfolio theorists arguing for ''slice and dice'' (including [[William Bernstein]], [[Larry Swedroe]], and Jeff Troutner) considered market cap indexes as dominated by growth stocks and were used as the growth proxies in ''slice and dice'' portfolios.

As an example, a four quadrant ''slice and dice'' portfolio consisting of S&amp;P indexes (available in the late 1990s or early 2000s) would have consisted of the following:

*S&amp;P 500 (25%)
*S&amp;P 500 Value (25%)
*S&amp;P 600 (25%)
*S&amp;P 600 Value (25%)

This 4x25 allocation is the scheme [[John Bogle]] analysed in his "Telltale Chart" address to the [[Bogleheads® convention meetings#Diehards III - Chicago | Bogleheads reunion]] in 2002 (Morningstar Investment Forum at that time).&lt;ref name="telltale"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In practice, this original 4x25 allocation scheme shifted over time to allow more value tilted allocations, and allocations more closely tied to an individual's risk profile. The [[Talk:Slice and dice | discussion tab (above)]] contains a brief summary of ''slice and dice'' portfolios from several [[:Category:Bogleheads authors |bogleheads authors]], beginning in 1999.

The 4x25 allocation template shows up in some of the "expert" [[Lazy Portfolios | lazy portfolios]]. The following three portfolios all follow the 4x25 pattern, although one shows an increased value tilt.

*[[Lazy portfolios#Bill Schultheis's "Coffeehouse" portfolio | William Schulteis's "Coffeehouse" portfolio]]
*[[Lazy portfolios#William Bernstein's "Coward's" portfolio | William Bernstein's "Coward's" portfolio]] - note: Total Stock Market approximates 10% large, 5% mid/small
*[[Lazy portfolios#Frank Armstrong's "Ideal Index" portfolio | Frank Armstrong's "Ideal Index" portfolio]] - employs a modest value tilt

==Approach==
As mentioned previously, ''slice and dice'' breaks the total stock market into four segments defined as large growth, large value, small growth and small value stocks. Similar to the [[Stock Basics#Style Boxes | equity style boxes]], the vertical segments (large and small) are based on the decile rankings by the Chicago Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP) which breaks down the market into 10 slices containing equal numbers of companies.From &lt;ref group="note" name="crsp"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.crsp.com/products/capbased.html| title=CRSP Cap-Based Portfolio Indices| publisher=CRSP}}:{{dead link}}
# Ranks all NYSE companies by market capitalization and divides them into ten equally populated portfolios.
# Places Amex and NASDAQ stocks into the deciles determined by the NYSE breakpoints, based on market capitalization
# The series of 10 indices are identified as CRSP 1 through CRSP 10, where CRSP 10 has the largest population and smallest market-capitalization.
# CRSP portfolios 1-2 represent large cap stocks, portfolios 3-5 represent mid-caps, portfolios 6-8 represent small caps, and portfolios 9-10 represent micro-caps.
# The portfolios are rebalanced quarterly and total return, capital appreciation return, and income return are calculated on a monthly basis. 

[http://www.crsp.com/crsp/about/history.html About CRSP]:{{dead link}} The Chicago Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP), part of the University of Chicago’s Booth School of Business, maintains a database giving a strong foundation for economic forecasting, stock market research, and financial analyses to academic institutions, investment banks, brokerage firms, corporations, banks, and government agencies.

''Slice and dice'' is based on the approach that small cap stocks and value stocks are associated with risk premiums. Weighting a portfolio in favor of small cap stocks and value stocks increases its volatility and therefore return over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.indexfunds.com/articles/20000403_slice_com_veh_JT.htm| title=In Defense of "Slice and Dice"| author=Jeff Troutner| publisher=Index Funds Advisors| date=2004| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040803114618/http://www.indexfunds.com/articles/20000403_slice_com_veh_JT.htm| archive-date=August 3, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those advocating the ''total stock market'' approach emphasize tax efficiency, simplicity, and the advantages of owning the total market.&lt;ref&gt;{{forum link| p=853494| title=Dreman Criticizes Fama/French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, a "total market" investor might be satisfied with a two-fund portfolio that approximates the entire market; that is, Total Stock Market Index and Total Bond Market Index.

A ''slice and dice'' investor would use more than one stock fund, such as [[Lazy Portfolios#Bill Schultheis's "Coffeehouse" portfolio | William Schulteis's "Coffeehouse portfolio"]], which allocates stocks with six equal "slices": Small-Cap Value Index, REIT Index, Total International Stock Index, Index (S&amp;P) 500, Value Index, and Small-Cap Index.&lt;ref name="nisi" /&gt;

''Slice and dice'' is more complex than a "total market" approach, because ''slice and dice'' portfolios need more attention and more frequent rebalancing than simpler portfolios. The debate boils down to how large the benefit is, whether it is possible to prove unequivocally that there really is a benefit, and, even if so, whether it is worth the effort.&lt;ref name="nisi" /&gt;

==Usage==
The definitions above have evolved over time to include additional asset classes, such as commodities or non-investment-grade [[High yield bonds |("high-yield") bonds]]. The definition of "asset class" is flexible and varies from authority to authority.&lt;ref name="nisi" /&gt;

''Slicing'' is used to divide an asset class or portfolio in one dimension.&lt;ref&gt;{{forum link| p=854113| title=What is "Slice and Dice"?}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*A sliced portfolio: stocks, bonds, cash

''Slice and dice'' divides an asset in two or more dimensions.
*A diced portfolio: stocks (domestic and international); bonds (domestic and foreign); cash ([[CD]]s denominated in US and other currencies).

Stocks are divided into two dimensions in a manner similar to the [[Stock Basics#Style Boxes | equity style boxes]]. The vertical ''slice'' splits the asset into value and growth, the horizontal ''dice'' (second cut) splits the asset into size (market cap).

International stocks can be divided according to regions. For splitting allocations along regional axes see: [[Slice and dice international]]. International stocks can also be ''sliced and diced'' along the four quadrants of the Fama and French three factor model using exchange traded funds. iShares offers developed market funds based on MSCI international indexes with large blend, large value, small blend and small value splits.

On the bond side, investors can ''slice and dice'' a bond portfolio into different "term" and "credit" exposures relative to a total bond index (or hold them in the same percentages, but still hold them separately to better control their allocation to each dimension).&lt;ref group="note"&gt;From email send by member SmallHi.&lt;/ref&gt; (Refer to the [[Bond basics#Style boxes | fixed income style boxes]], which ''slice'' vertically as "credit risk" and ''dice'' horizontally as "term" or duration.)

What ''slice and dice'' is not: if you slice the total world market into pieces and hold each piece in the proportion it represents of the total world market, then you still hold the total world market. There is no tilt and no slice.&lt;ref&gt;{{forum link| p=854188| title=What is "Slice and Dice"?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tilt===
[[Value tilting - stock | Tilting]] is sometimes associated with ''slice and dice'', as both approaches overweight small cap and/or value stocks compared to the total stock market.&lt;ref&gt;{{forum link| p=853682| title=What is "Slice and Dice"?}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, tilting and ''slice and dice'' are completely different concepts.

Tilting does require allocation according to a ''slice and dice'' model. However, tilting alters the allocation across asset classes, while ''slice and dice'' only specifies that the asset classes are managed explicitly and are fixed.

Tilting means a preference for some asset classes or for some factor loading that is different from the total market of a particular asset class, usually US equities.&lt;ref&gt;{{forum link| p=853647| title=What is "Slice and Dice"?}}&lt;/ref&gt; Multifactor (multi-factor) investing uses this approach.

==John Bogle's own view==
[[John Bogle]] gives an interesting, nuanced, and skeptical view in "The Telltale Chart",&lt;ref name="telltale" /&gt; based on a 2002 speech, and included in his 2010 book ''Don't Count On It!'' The main point of the essay is that many popular investment approaches that are often believed to have superior performance, only do so for a while before succumbing to "reversion to the mean" (RTM). His examples include small-cap stocks, value stocks, and "slice and dice" portfolios. (It is commendable that he updated all the charts to 2009 for inclusion in the book, even though many of the assets and portfolios he charts did well recently, undercutting his point).

A '''three-fund portfolio''' is a portfolio which uses only basic asset classes &amp;mdash; usually a domestic stock "total market" [[index fund]], an international stock "total market" index fund and a bond "total market" index fund. It is often recommended for and by Bogleheads attracted by "the majesty of simplicity" ([[John Bogle]]'s phrase), and for those who want finer control and better tax-efficiency than they would get in an all-in-one fund like a [[Target date retirement funds | target retirement fund]].

There is no magic in the number three. The phrase is shorthand for a style of portfolio construction that emphasizes simplicity, and is related to [[Lazy_portfolios#Three-fund_lazy_portfolios|lazy portfolios]].

A three-fund portfolio is based on the fundamental asset classes, [[Stock basics |stocks]] and [[Bond basics | bonds]]. It is assumed that [[Money Markets | cash]] is not counted within the investment portfolio, so it is not included. On the other hand, it is assumed that every investor should hold both [[Domestic/International |domestic and international stocks]]. The task, then, is to take these three basic non-cash assets &amp;mdash; domestic stocks, international stocks, and bonds &amp;mdash; decide how much of each to hold (your [[Asset allocation|asset allocation]]). Choose where to hold each of these asset classes, and finally choose a mutual fund to use for each asset class.

===Choosing your asset allocation===
{{Main|Asset allocation}}
{{Notice| '''You must decide for yourself what percentage of stocks to hold''', based in part on your personal risk tolerance. There are no shortcuts and and it needs to be done no matter what investment approach you are using.}}

Even if you are going to use a single Target Retirement fund, you should not take the shortcut implied by the use of a retirement year in the name; you need to decide for yourself what percentage of your portfolio you want to invest in stocks, and choose the fund that matches it. Even if you are going to use a single [[Vanguard funds: life strategy funds vs target retirement funds | LifeStrategy fund]], you need to decide which of them to use, based on the percentage of stocks each you hold.

One traditional rough rule-of-thumb is "age in bonds," or percentage of stocks = 100 - age. This is a conservative rule, and leads to smaller percentages of stocks than Vanguard chooses for [[Vanguard target retirement funds |its Target Retirement series]].

The second decision is what percentage of your stock allocation should be U.S. (domestic) and what should be international. This is a much less critical decision because U.S. and international stocks have similar risk profiles and have similar long-term returns. In 2010, Vanguard increased the international allocation of its Target Retirement and LifeStrategy funds from 20% of the stock allocation to 30%, and increased it again to 40% in 2015.

&lt;!--

Author note -- as of 2023, this Vanguard tool no longer exists.

====Vanguard's tool====
As of 2020, Vanguard provides a tool that recommends a balanced portfolio similar to the kind discussed here (Vanguard recommends a [[Vanguard four fund portfolio|four fund portfolio]]), with percentages based on your responses to a short online questionnaire. The tool is entitled [https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/tools/recommendation?reset=true Get a recommendation to fit your goals]; you can navigate to it by way of Vanguard.com, Go to personal investors' site, What we offer: Mutual Funds, Get a Recommendation.

See [[Asset allocation]] for more details.
--&gt;
===Choosing your asset location===

Since your portfolio may be split between multiple locations (one or more tax-advantaged retirement accounts, and one or more taxable accounts) you should look at [[tax-efficient fund placement]] to determine which funds belong in each account. In general, the international fund should go into a taxable account, the bond fund should go into a tax-advantaged account, and the domestic equity fund should fill in the remaining space.

You may need to hold the same (or equivalent) funds in multiple accounts to have ideal asset allocation and asset location.

===Choosing three funds===

For Bogleheads, the answer for "which mutual funds" to use in a three-fund portfolio is "low-cost funds that represent entire markets." 

If you ask different people to choose funds for a three-fund portfolio, you will get different fund choices. The differences are usually of no fundamental importance, and are usually the result of a) making choices between nearly identical, almost interchangeable funds, and b) simplifying further by using combination package funds. Watch out for high expense ratios, particularly in the bond funds.

====Vanguard funds====

From Vanguard's list of "core funds," the funds that are best for a three-fund portfolio are:

* Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund (VTSAX)
* Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund (VTIAX)
* Vanguard Total Bond Market Fund (VBTLX)

So, a "three-fund portfolio" might consist of 42% Total Stock Market Index, 18% Total International Stock Index, and 40% Total Bond Market fund. For example, [[Taylor Larimore |Taylor Larimore's]] "[[Lazy portfolios|Lazy Portfolio]]" consists of these three funds based on the investor's desired asset allocation.

Of course, you could use [[Exchange-traded funds | ETF]]s rather than mutual funds. For example, you could use Total Stock Market ETF (VTI),&lt;ref group="note"&gt; See [[Vanguard US stock ETFs]] for information on VTI (Total Market Index).&lt;/ref&gt; Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund (VXUS)&lt;ref group="note"&gt; See [[Vanguard international stock ETFs]] for information on VXUS (Total International ETF).&lt;/ref&gt; for international, and Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF (BND).

====Other than Vanguard, Boglehead-style====

The building blocks of Boglehead-style investing are low-[[Expense ratios |expense-ratio]] [[Indexing |index]] mutual funds and/or [[Exchange-traded funds |ETFs]]. Vanguard fans would suggest that Vanguard has the best and most complete lineup of such funds, and that the most convenient place to hold Vanguard mutual funds is directly at Vanguard. As a result, the Bogleheads forum and Wiki tends to be Vanguard-oriented. But investing according to the [[Bogleheads investment philosophy | Boglehead philosophy]] certainly does not require you to invest at Vanguard or use Vanguard products. Here are some suggestions on how to do it with other funds. (Refer to the associated wiki article for additional information.)

Some brokerages such as [[Merrill Edge]] do not offer their own family of mutual funds so you will to consider different fund families. First ask your brokerage which mutual funds have no transaction fees. You typically will choose between two options: a) the lowest cost funds like Vanguard's but with a transaction fee, or b) higher cost funds like T. Rowe Price's but with no transaction fee. The best choice depends on how often you buy or sell and how much you invest over time.

====Other considerations====

A total stock market index fund represents the whole market, while an S&amp;P 500 fund does not. Now that total stock market funds exist and have expenses just as low as S&amp;P 500 funds, total stock market funds are preferable. In practice, the importance and magnitude of the difference is a subject of debate. In a 401(k) plan with limited choices you might very well opt for an S&amp;P 500 index fund to serve as the domestic stock component of a three-fund portfolio.

Alternatively, you can [[Approximating total stock market |approximate a Total Stock Market fund]] by combining an S&amp;P 500 index fund with one or more mid-cap and small-cap funds. There are "[[Extended market index fund|completion index]]" funds such as Vanguard's Extended Market fund (available as an open-end fund as VEXAX and as an ETF as VXF) which can be added to an S&amp;P 500 fund in a specified ratio to produce a hybrid which should perform like a Total Stock Market fund.

Vanguard perplexes investors by offering two virtually interchangeable international stock market index funds: Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund (VTIAX) and Vanguard FTSE All-World ex-US (VFWAX). See [[FAQ on Vanguard international funds#Should_I_buy_Total_International_or_FTSE_All-World_ex-US.3F|Should I buy Total International or FTSE All-World ex-US]] for the details.

For Vanguard, be aware of any minimum investment required by each fund; for instance, the Admiral shares of most Vanguard index funds require a minimum investment of $3,000. If you will have difficulty meeting these minimums, you may want to consider an all-in-one single-fund portfolio until you accumulate enough that this is not an issue.

The Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Fund, and those of several other firms, track the Barclay's U.S. Aggregate Index (in Vanguard's case, the Barclay's U.S. Aggregate Float-Adjusted Index). In Barclay's words, this index tracks the "investment grade, US dollar-denominated, fixed-rate taxable bond market." The "bond market" is a somewhat diffuse concept. Some people complain that the Aggregate index is not really the "total" bond market. Barclay's has a broader index, the Barclay's U.S. Universal Index. It includes "USD-denominated, taxable bonds that are rated either investment grade or high-yield." As of 2015, 87% of the Universal index is made up of bonds in the Aggregate index, but the other 13% includes "U.S. Corporate High Yield Index, Investment Grade 144A Index, Eurodollar Index, U.S. Emerging Markets Index, and the non-ERISA eligible portion of the CMBS Index." People who have strong feelings about wanting to be more "total" than the Vanguard Total Bond Index Fund might prefer the Barclay's Universal index. As of 2015, there is at least one product, the iShares Core Total USD Bond Market ETF, IUSB, that tracks the Barclay's Universal index, and with an 0.13% expense ratio, it qualifies as a "low-cost index fund." It could be used as the bond component of a three-fund portfolio.

====Combining domestic and international stocks====

The relative percentage of domestic and international stocks is a subject of intense discussion in the forum. One sensible option is to hold domestic and international stocks in the same proportions as they represent in the total world economy. As of October 2014, that would be about 50% U.S. and 50% international. This option is recommended by Burton Malkiel and Charles Ellis, both of whom have longstanding ties to Vanguard, in their book ''The Elements of Investing''. Other authorities suggest holding less than that, and Vanguard currently allocates 40% of stock to international in its [[Vanguard Target Retirement Funds |Target Retirement funds]], and in their research, advise holding 20-40% international allocations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.vanguard.com/pdf/flgiecr.pdf| title=International Equity: Considerations and Recommendations| publisher=Vanguard Investment Counseling &amp; Research| date=January 2, 2009| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200513135423/https://www.vanguard.com/pdf/flgiecr.pdf| archive-date=May 13, 2020| accessdate=June 5, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; If your own preference is for a "total world" weighting, then the portfolio can obviously be simplified using Vanguard's Total World Stock Index fund, which is exactly what Malkiel and Ellis suggest. Such a two-fund portfolio would use these funds:

* Vanguard Total World Stock Index Fund (VTWSX) for both domestic and international stocks
* Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Fund (VBTLX)

====Combining stocks and bonds====

The Vanguard Balanced Index Fund holds 60% Total Stock Market Index Fund and 40% Total Bond Market Index Fund. By adding an international stock fund, you could create a three-fund portfolio with two funds.

==Adequacy of a three-fund portfolio==

One Marketwatch article&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Jonathan Burton| date=December 5, 2006| url=https://www.marketwatch.com/story/story/print?guid=F047C5E4-3F49-451A-9A69-FD8FBF2D3A15| title=Three mutual funds that end the guesswork| publisher=Market watch| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210224224221/https://www.marketwatch.com/story/these-three-mutual-funds-may-be-all-youll-ever-need| archive-date=June 5, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; quotes various '''non'''-Boglehead commentators as saying such things as "You can make it really simple, be well-diversified, and do better than two-thirds of investors" and "That three-pronged approach is going to beat the vast majority of the individual stock and bond portfolios that most people have at brokerage firms... there is a certain elegance in the simplicity of it."

In her Forbes article, ''"How To Diversify With Just Three Funds"'', Boglehead [[Laura Dogu | Laura F. Dogu]] describes this approach and comments "With only these three funds (Vanguard Total Stock Market Index fund, Vanguard Total International Stock Market Index fund, and the Vanguard Total Bond Market fund), investors can create a low cost, broadly diversified portfolio that is very easy to manage and rebalance.... Some investors may be uncomfortable with holding only three funds and will question whether they are truly diversified. With these three holdings the answer on diversification is a resounding 'YES'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Laura Dogu| date=January 28, 2011 |url=https://blogs.forbes.com/thebogleheadsview/2011/01/28/three-funds-to-own-now| title=How To Diversify With Just Three Funds| publisher=Forbes| accessdate=June 5, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2015 article, ''"The only funds you need in your portfolio now"'', Walter Updegrave commented: "Of course, some advisers will suggest that you're missing out unless you spread your money among all manner of exotic investments (which they're more than happy to sell you). But the more complicated your portfolio is, the more expensive and more prone to blow-ups it is likely to be -- which also increases the odds that it will generate subpar returns," and suggested a "three-fund diversified portfolio: simply invest in the following three funds (or their ETF equivalents): a total U.S. stock market fund, a total international stock market fund and a total U.S bond market fund."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Walter Updegrave| date=December 30, 2014| url=https://money.cnn.com/2014/12/30/retirement/portfolio-funds/| title=The only funds you need in your portfolio now| publisher=CNN Money| accessdate=June 5, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some would argue that a three-fund portfolio is good enough and that there is no real proof that more complicated portfolios are any better. Others would argue that the evidence for superiority of [[Slice and dice|slice and dice]], "[[Value tilting - stock |small value tilting]]," and inclusion of classes like [[REIT]]s is too strong to ignore.

==What about bonds?==

As of 2016 when this is being written, bond interest rates are near historic lows and there is a good deal of buzz to the effect that the "thirty-year bull market in bonds has ended" and that investing strategies that have worked for decades should be changed to reflect new realities. Should the three-fund portfolio be modified? No definitive answer can be given to this controversial question, but we can sketch out some of the prevalent '''and conflicting''' opinions on the matter.

# Some would say that advocates of complex investing strategies '''always''' have reasons why simple approaches "once worked but do not work any more." Advocates of simplicity might say to ignore the noise and continue to stay the course; it may turn out that something else does better--something always does--but that a three-fund portfolio is still good enough.
# In 2013, Vanguard altered the composition of its Target Retirement funds; from 2010 to 2013, most of them were literally three-fund portfolios as described here. Now, the bond portion has been modified to include international bonds; specifically, the bond allocation is now 70% Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Fund and 30% Total International Bond Index Fund. Nothing Vanguard has published would lead you to believe that this is a big change or that it will have a big effect. Some may find it appealing to follow Vanguard's lead.
# Some well-informed Bogleheads make a strong case that the "bond" component of a three-fund portfolio might well be filled with non-[[Certificate_of_deposit#Brokered_CDs|brokered]] bank CDs instead of a traditional bond fund.
# Suggestions 2 and 3 are adjustments that do not radically change the risk of the bond component. For the record, it should be stated that Burton Malkiel and Charles Ellis, in the 2013 edition of their book ''Elements of Investing,'' made a controversial and much more radical suggestion, which shocked many forum members. But, because they were early champions of indexing, each with long associations with Vanguard, their suggestion should be noted. They seemed to be recommending the replacement of a traditional high-grade bond fund with a 50/50 mix of emerging markets bonds and a high-dividend stock fund. Using Vanguard's "risk potential" categories, that means they are recommending replacing a holding in risk potential category 2 with a mix of holdings in categories 3 and 4.

Following the resurgence of inflation in 2021, [[Treasury Inflation Protected Securities]] (TIPS) have now become more popular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://blbarnitz4.wordpress.com/2016/12/04/a-three-fund-portfolio-tailored-for-stable-retirement-spending/#more-4071| title=A Three Fund Portfolio tailored for stable retirement spending| publisher=Bogleheads® blog| accessdate=August 2, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contrasts with other approaches==

There are single, all-in-one, "funds of funds" that are intended to be used as an investor's whole portfolio. Vanguard funds in this category include the Target Retirement funds, the LifeStrategy funds; perhaps the actively-managed Wellington and Wellesley funds would qualify, too.

On the one hand, a three-fund portfolio involves a do-it-yourself aspect that makes it more complicated than using an all-in-one fund. For example, because different assets grow at different rates, any investor who chooses a do-it-yourself approach needs to "[[Rebalancing |rebalance]]" occasionally &amp;mdash; perhaps annually &amp;mdash; in order to maintain the desired percentage mix. 

On the other hand, three-fund portfolios are simpler than the genres called "Coffeehouse portfolios" ([[Bill Schultheis |William Schultheis's]] term), "couch potato" portfolios, or "[[Lazy portfolios |lazy portfolios]]," which are intended to be easy for do-it-yourselfers but are nevertheless slice-and-dice portfolios using six or more funds.

==The LifeStrategy and Target Retirement funds are four-fund portfolios==
{{Main|Vanguard four fund portfolio}}

The Vanguard Target Retirement funds and LifeStrategy funds use a four fund allocation.&lt;ref group="note"&gt; The Vanguard Target Retirement Income fund, and Target funds nearing target dates add a fifth fund, the Vanguard Short Term Inflation Indexed Bond Fund, to the allocation. &lt;/ref&gt; The funds include:

*Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund
*Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund
*Vanguard Total Bond Market II Index Fund
*Vanguard Total International Bond Index Fund

Some see advantages in holding a do-it-yourself four-fund portfolio rather than a LifeStrategy fund or Target Retirement fund, even if the same four funds are used. The advantages are small but meaningful to some, and include:

* Improved tax efficiency for taxable investors by placing each fund in its best location
* Direct control over allocation percentages
* Independence from Vanguard's small course changes in the Target Retirement funds (as when they increased stock allocation in 2006, and changed domestic-to-international ratio in 2010, and added international bonds in 2013)
* Availability of slightly-lower-cost Admiral shares in the individual funds, but not the Target Retirement or LifeStrategy funds

==Lazy portfolios==
{{main|Lazy portfolios}}

Lazy portfolios are ''specific'' portfolio suggestions, designed to perform well in most market conditions. Most contain a small number of low-cost funds that are easy to rebalance. They are "lazy" in that the investor can maintain the same asset allocation for an extended period of time, as they generally contain 30-40% bonds, suitable for most pre-retirement investors.

The term has been popularized by Paul B. Farrell, who writes MarketWatch columns about various simple portfolios. Instead of going through the step of deciding on your own asset allocation, you accept the suggestion that, say, 2/3 stocks to 1/3 bonds and half-and-half domestic and international is a good enough, one-size-fits-all allocation.

==Other variations==
{{See also|Variations on Bogleheads® investing}}

A three-fund combination can serve as the core of a more complex portfolio, where you add a small [[Variations on Bogleheads® investing#Having a play money account|play money allocation]] or a [[Tilt|tilt]] to some corner of the market that interests you.

==Historic notes==

* Scott Burns wrote a 1991 article, "Exactly How To Be A Couch Potato Portfolio Manager". The original "basic, humble, couch potato portfolio" consisted of two funds, "the Vanguard Index 500 fund, which mimics the S&amp;P 500 index, and the Vanguard Fixed Income Short Term Government Bond Fund."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Scott Burns| date=October 1, 1991| url=https://assetbuilder.com/knowledge-center/articles/scott-burns/exactly_how_to_be_a_couch_potato_portfolio_manager| title=Exactly How To Be A Couch Potato Portfolio Manager| publisher=Asset Builder| url-access=limited}} (limited access)&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Taylor Larimore]] was an early advocate of this approach, which he described in 1999 in a Morningstar posting, "[https://web.archive.org/web/20210307193847/http://socialize.morningstar.com/NewSocialize/ViewPost.aspx?apptype=0&amp;PostID=17632 Which is better, 15 funds or 4?]" He stated that "It is no longer necessary to own large portfolios. Now, with only four funds, it is possible to own all the securities in every asset-class, style, and cap-size, in exact proportion to their market weight. These four funds are: Total Stock Market Fund, Total Bond Market Fund, Total International Fund and a Money-Market Fund."

Over time the meaning has been extended.&lt;/ref&gt; DCA is an alternative to lump sum investing, which is to make the entire investment immediately. It is a technique to overcome fear in investing by mitigating the risk of loss over the short term. 

For any sequence of constant-dollar purchases&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Equal parts means that the amount (dollars) is constant, hence the term "constant-dollar".&lt;/ref&gt; of an asset whose price fluctuates, you would purchase more shares when prices are lower than when prices are high.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dollarcostaveraging.asp| title=Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) Explained With Examples and Considerations| publisher=Investopedia| date=April 26, 2023| accessdate=August 12, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the average cost per share will be lower than the average price per share over the same period.

This consequence of DCA provides an argument to persuade investors to make systematic, periodic fixed dollar amount investments regardless of market prices. 

The term DCA is also encompasses similar investment concepts such as [[#Automatic investment|periodic automatic investment]] (used almost universally by individual investors to fund retirement accounts out of earned income).

A variant on the idea of DCA is "[[#Reverse dollar cost averaging|reverse dollar-cost averaging]]", which relates to periodic automatic withdrawals made during retirement.&lt;ref name="Hebeler"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.analyzenow.com/Articles/Investments/Investment%20Articles/ReverseDollarCostAvg1-1-01.pdf| title=Reverse Dollar Cost Averaging| author=Henry K. Hebeler| date=January 2, 2001| accessdate=August 12, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, [[value averaging]] closely resembles dollar-cost averaging but differs in that the investor selects a target growth rate or amount on their asset base or portfolio each period, and then adjusts the next period's contribution according to the relative gain or shortfall made on the original asset base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/value_averaging.asp| title=Value Averaging: What it Means, Examples| publisher=Investopedia| date=May 5, 2022| accessdate=August 12, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dollar-cost averaging versus lump sum==
When you are ready to invest money, a common question is whether you should invest it as a '''lump sum''' or '''dollar-cost average (DCA)''' by splitting your investment across several payments. The answer depends on the degree to which you are willing to accept lower expected returns in exchange for lower potential losses (aversion to possible loss).

In most cases, you are moving your money from cash (or the equivalent, a low-yielding [[Money markets | money market]]) to some mix of [[Stock basics | stocks]] and [[Bond basics | bonds]]. The expected return of both stocks and bonds is higher than cash. However, their volatility is higher as well. The risk is that just after making your investment, the market could crash, causing your investment to quickly lose value due to the unfortunate timing of your purchase. 

Of course, according to [[Bogleheads® investment philosophy | Bogleheads investment philosophy]], you should only be investing in the first place into a diversified asset allocation. Also, you should only be holding volatile funds like stocks and bonds if your investing horizon is long enough to ride out their volatility.

Lump sum investing will always carry a higher expected return, because it immediately moves your funds from asset classes with lower expected returns to ones with higher expected returns. Note that higher ''expected'' returns do not guarantee that your ''actual'' returns will be higher. A Vanguard study&lt;ref name=":0"&gt; {{cite web| url=https://pressroom.vanguard.com/nonindexed/7.23.2012_Dollar-cost_Averaging.pdf| title=Dollar-cost averaging just means taking risk later| publisher=Vanguard| date=July 23, 2012| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121107195530/https://pressroom.vanguard.com/nonindexed/7.23.2012_Dollar-cost_Averaging.pdf| archive-date=November 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; concluded that lump sum investing has historically produced higher returns two thirds of the time when the DCA plan was implemented over 12 months. Lump sum was also more favorable when the analysis used risk-adjusted returns.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; DCA plans with longer timelines have worse results. A related Vanguard publication notes that if a DCA plan was implemented over 36 months, lump sum investing produced higher returns approximately 92% of the time. In addition, over a 12-month period, the maximum downside potential of DCA was higher than the maximum upside potential.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Berkowitz|first=Daniel B.|date=2016|title=Invest now or temporarily hold your cash?|url=https://www.optimizedportfolio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/vanguard-invest-now-or-temporarily-hold-your-cash.pdf|publisher=Vanguard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some investors are willing to sacrifice some expected return in order to reduce their potential loss, knowing that higher expected return come with higher potential loss. For those investors, dollar-cost averaging is superior because it reduces the chances of investing all the money just prior to a market drop. Instead, as the price fluctuates each month, you will buy more shares when the price is low and less when it is high. In such volatile markets your actual return can be higher than the return of the lumpsum which will match the return of the assets. 

Many new investors are more interested in minimizing their potential loss, and it is important that an ill-timed market drop does not scare them off from investing in the future. Many experienced investors are more interested in maximizing their expected returns. You can also decide to split the difference, where you invest half immediately and the other half over 6 or so months.

=== Costs===

Most no-load mutual funds allow small, regular investments with no fees. However, most investors pay a commission to purchase a load-fund or an [[Exchange-traded fund]] (ETF). Depending on the size of the commission and the investment, dollar-cost averaging into a load-fund or an ETF could be far more expensive than purchasing as a lump sum. For ETFs, the [[bid/ask spread]] is the same between DCA and lump sum.

==Automatic investment==

Most investors make regular contributions through their [[401(k)]] plans or by having a set amount auto-deducted from their bank account into an [[IRA]] or taxable account. When this money is automatically invested, it has the same benefit of dollar-cost averaging that you buy more shares when prices are low and less when they are high. However, this form of investing is not dollar-cost averaging. It is called '''periodic investing'''. The difference is that periodic investing is maximizing expected return, because you are investing the money as soon as you have it. DCA applies when you have the money to invest, but delay doing so.

===Switching to a more conservative portfolio===

Some investors who are new to a [[Bogleheads® investment philosophy | Bogleheads investment philosophy]] may find their portfolios contain too much equity. Even worse, some investors have a large portion of their net worth held in a single stock, such as through an employee purchase plan. They generally want to sell some of their equities and buy bonds. In these cases where an investor wants to move from high risk and volatility assets to lower risk and volatility assets, a lump sum transaction makes more sense than DCA. That is because lump sum both immediately moves to the expected return and volatility the investor wants, while also minimizing potential regret.

==Reverse dollar-cost averaging==

Investors who regularly add to their investment portfolios with '''periodic investing''' purchase more shares when prices are low and less shares when prices are high. Author Henry K. Hebeler&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Henry K. Hebeler |title=Getting Started in A Financially Secure Retirement| publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons| date=April 27, 2007| isbn=978-0-470-11778-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; points out that investors ''' periodically distributing''' retirement income from their portfolios experience the reverse action, redeeming more shares when prices are low and less shares when prices are high. Hebeler terms this process, "reverse dollar-cost averaging" with results that should, on average, reduce expected returns.

Examining rolling 20 year investment periods from 1927 to 1995 for a portfolio consisting of 50% large cap stocks ([[S&amp;P 500 index|S&amp;P 500]]); 40% long term [[Corporate bonds|corporate bonds]]; and 10% [[Treasury bill|treasury bills]], with expense loadings of 1.50% for stocks; 0.50% for bonds; and 0.30% for cash), Hebeler provides average real returns for four scenarios: the portfolio; the accumulating investor (saving for retirement); the distributing investor (withdrawal during retirement); as well as the results of 80% percentile returns (reflecting desires for portfolio survivability for retirement distributions). Indexing the portfolios would add 0.70% to each portfolio's returns simply due to reduced costs.&lt;ref name="Hebeler" /&gt;

''Value Averaging'' is for experienced investors. You may need to hold funds in reserve, such as a money market fund, to cover additional contributions needed during market declines. Managing this cash flow adds further complications. Please ask in the forum for assistance.
}}
'''{{PAGENAME}}''' uses a formula, shown below, to guide how much you invest into a given investment at a specific time. The emphasis is on establishing a portfolio target value or "value path". Value averaging aims to periodically increase the investment's value by this calculated amount.

Whenever a portfolio under-performs, you will have to make a larger investment to make up for the under-performance. The converse is also true, so that if the portfolio outperforms its targeted rate of return, then then you do not purchase more shares. You can think of value averaging as a combination of [[dollar cost averaging]] and portfolio [[rebalancing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.valueaveraging.ca/research/The%20Value%20Averaging%20Investment%20Strategy.pdf| author=Bruce Ramsey| title=The Value Averaging Investment Strategy| publisher=VA Investment Software| accessdate=August 13, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former Harvard professor Michael E. Edelson introduced value averaging in his book ''Value Averaging'', published by Wiley in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Michael E. Edelson| title=
Value Averaging: The Safe and Easy Strategy for Higher Investment Returns| publisher=Wiley| date=2006| isbn=978-0-470-04977-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==How value averaging works==
The key idea is to create a ''Value Path'' which will describe the investment’s target level for each time period. You must simply make the proper investment or sale at each period so that the holdings are equal to the target value. 

The variables and the formula for the Value Path are as follows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.sigmainvesting.com/advanced-investing-topics/value-averaging| title=Value Averaging| publisher=Sigma Investing| date=2007| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210508133532/http://www.sigmainvesting.com/advanced-investing-topics/value-averaging| archive-date=May 8, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Variables: 
*'''t''' =	Time period (can be months, quarters, years, etc.)
*'''V&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;''' =	Target value of investment at time period '''t'''
*'''C''' =	Target initial contribution per period
*'''r''' =	Expected rate of growth per period of investment
*'''g''' =	Expected rate of growth per period of contribution
*'''R''' =	Average rate of growth of investment and contribution

To simplify the calculation, we will set '''R''' = ('''r''' + '''g''') / 2. Thus, '''R''' is just an average of the growth rates of the investment and the contribution amount.

Now, the formula for the Value Path:
:'''V&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;''' = '''C''' * '''t''' * (1 + '''R''')'''&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;'''

Now, you can simply use this formula to generate a Value Path for your investment. There are two different approaches for this depending on your needs. If you have a specific goal in mind, for example you need $100,000 in 10 years for your son’s college expenses, you can start with the final value of the Value Path and use that to determine the required value of your initial contribution ('''C'''). So, for our example, if we were working with monthly time periods, we would want '''V&lt;sub&gt;120&lt;/sub&gt;''' = 100,000. Then, we solve '''V&lt;sub&gt;120&lt;/sub&gt;''' = '''C''' * 120 * (1 + '''R''')'''&lt;sup&gt;120&lt;/sup&gt;'''.

On the other hand, if you have no specific savings goal but do know the amount of initial contribution that you are comfortable with, then you can plug in a value of '''C''' and solve for all the values of '''V&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'''.

It is a good idea to use a spreadsheet to create your Value Paths and track your progress. An important thing to remember about the Value Path is that you should remain flexible and update your Value Path if circumstances change. For instance, if the rate of growth for your investment or your ability to contribute changes, you should re-calculate the Value Path from your current point.

The Value Path formula depends heavily on your estimates of the rate of growth of the investment asset. Because of this, it is very important to provide as realistic rates as possible.

==Example==
The following spreadsheet table compares value averaging with [[dollar cost averaging]]:

{{#widget:Google Spreadsheet

}}&lt;br /&gt;
{{trim|{{Spreadsheet|key=1sqEPSLZUCSvNxVyO5D4Dg_gSAL56gfL7Jia4mBRxGmo}}}}

==Cautions and qualifications==
*Value averaging adds a growth factor (by formula, consisting of estimates of both the investment's return as well as growth in the contribution level) to the regular periodic investment of savings flows. If your contribution amount is not expected to grow, you should set this factor at 0% so that investment growth is the only growth variable. 
*Value averaging may need both purchases and sales of the underlying investment, based on the investment performance of the investment. It requires a cash account for prospective purchases as well as any sales proceeds.
*Value averaging sales can realize taxable capital gains. You might want to restrict it to tax advantaged accounts; or alternately, adopt a policy constraint forbidding or delaying sales in the taxable account.
*You have to be careful in a declining market, as you will need to have additional funds available for investment. As time progresses and the account value grows, you may need even more funds to reach the amount required for the chosen period. If the market is volatile near the end of the investing time frame, you will need a lot of additional funds. This may catch investors unprepared for this additional savings requirement.
*Value averaging most often provides a lower average cost per share than does DCA, and also provides for a higher internal rate of return (IRR). This does not, however, mean that value averaging will result in a higher realized profit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://ssrn.com/abstract=1606347| author=Simon Hayley| title=Value Averaging and the Automated Bias of Performance Measures| date=March 11, 2011| accessdate=August 13, 2023}}.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is when investors make regular, equal payments into a [[Mutual fund|mutual fund]], trading account or [[Employer Retirement Plans Overview|retirement account,]] such as a [[401(k)]]. Systematic investing encourages you to establish a regular savings habit, and because you make purchases at various market prices, in essence you [[Dollar cost averaging|dollar-cost-average]] the average purchase price of your investments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/systematicinvestmentplan.asp| title=Systematic Investment Plan (SIP): Definition and Example| publisher=Investopedia| accessdate=September 17, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The way most investors invest systematically is in employer-provided contributory retirement plans. However, investment firms generally offer programs that let you set up individual systematic investment. These programs include [[#Automatic investment plans|Automatic investment plans]] and [[#Contractual investment plans|Contractual investment plans]].

==Automatic investment plans==
Many providers offer an '''Automatic Investment Plan''' (AIP), an investment program that lets you contribute small amounts of money in regular (monthly, quarterly, semiannual, or annual) intervals. Funds are automatically deducted from your checking/savings account or paycheck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/automaticinvestmentplan.asp| title=Automatic Investment Plan: How it Works, Different Types| publisher=Investopedia| accessdate=September 17, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt; AIPs most commonly offer [[mutual fund]]s (both in [[Principles of Tax-Efficient Fund Placement|taxable accounts]] and [[Traditional IRA|IRA]] accounts), [[Variable Annuity|variable annuity]] subaccounts, and [[529 plans|529 savings plan]] funds.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;For an example of AIP, see: {{cite web| url=https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/personal-finance/automate-savings| title=Automated investing: How to save and invest more| publisher=Fidelity| accessdate=September 17, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If you want to establish an AIP following the [[Bogleheads' philosophy]], consider establishing AIP programs with low cost no-load mutual funds, no-load low cost variable annuities, and direct sold [[529 cost comparisons|low-cost 529 plan]] portfolios.

==Contractual investment plans==
{{Warning|In an investor alert regarding contractual plans FINRA offers the following advice:&lt;ref name="FINRA"/&gt;
{{blockquote|For a specific type of systematic investment plan—sometimes referred to as a "contractual plan" or "periodic payment plan"—an investor must make a long-term commitment of 10 or 15 years. While the majority of these plans are sold to military personnel, they are also sold to civilians. These plans come with high upfront costs and are expensive if the full term of payment is not completed. If your goal is to save for retirement, most employer savings and retirement plans allow you to save through payroll deduction. Military personnel can make long-term periodic investments in the U.S. Thrift Savings Plan. This plan has no up-front load and low on-going expenses}}}}

Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs) in the US are regulated as Periodic Investment Plans under the federal securities laws. A typical SIP contractual plan lets you accumulate shares of a mutual fund indirectly by making small regular monthly payments, usually as little as $50, over a period of 10, 15 or 25 years. Historically, the majority of contractual plans have been sold to [[Military finances|military personnel]]. These plans impose high upfront commission costs, as much as 50% of the first year payments, and are especially expensive if the full term of the plan is not completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/investor_protection_guide_systematic_investment_plan_%28sip%29| title=Investor Protection Guide: Systematic Investment Plan (SIP)| publisher=Legal Information Institute| accessdate=September 17, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contractual plans have the following characteristics:&lt;ref name="FINRA"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.finra.org/Investors/ProtectYourself/InvestorAlerts/MutualFunds/p012785A| title=Systematic Investment Plans—Educate Yourself Before You Enlist| publisher=FINRA| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190117214257/http://www.finra.org/investors/alerts/systematic-investment-plans| archive-date=January 17, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''High first-year cost'''. You are required to pay a creation and sales charge equal to as much as 50 percent of the first 12 monthly investments. If you increase the amount of your monthly payments, you may owe an additional creation and sales charge on the new investment.
*'''Long-term investment'''. Typically, systematic investment plans require 180 fixed monthly payments over a 15-year period, with the option of making payments for up to 25 years (300 investments).
*'''No direct mutual fund ownership.''' Investments in a contractual plan are placed in a trust. The trust invests your regular payments, minus fees and expenses, in shares of a mutual fund.
*'''Missed Payments'''. The sponsor may terminate your plan if you fail to make investments for a period of 6 or 12 consecutive months.
*'''Fees and expenses'''. Plan expenses include creation and sales charge fees, mutual fund management and distribution expenses, and various custodial and service fees. The following table shows the cost burden of the creation and sales charge:
:{| class="wikitable" align="center"
|+ Contractual plan creation and sales fee expense
|-
! Contributions discontinued after !! Creation and sales fee as percentage of investment
|-
| 12 payments || 50%
|-
| 18 payments || 31.6%
|-
| 24 payments || 25%
|-
| 60 payments || 10%
|-
| 180 payments || 5%
|-
| 360 payments || 3.3%
|}
*'''Cancellation and Refund Rights'''. An investor in a contractual plan can cancel the contract with the following rights:
**'''45-Day Cancellation Right'''. You will receive a notice of your cancellation rights within 60 days after your first investment in the plan. You can cancel your plan within 45 days of the mailing date of that notice. If you choose to cancel your plan, you will receive a cash refund equal to (1) the current value of your investment and (2) the total sales and creation charge you paid. The current value of your shares may be more or less than your original investment. 
**'''18-Month Cancellation Right.''' You are also able cancel the plan within 18 months after your first investment in the plan. If you choose to cancel your plan after the 45-day cancellation period, you will receive a cash refund equal to (1) the current value of your investment and (2) the amount of the sales and creation charge you paid that exceeds 15 percent of the total investments you have made in the plan. You should receive a notice of your 18-month cancellation right if you miss (1) three or more of your monthly investment payments during the first 15 months of the plan or (2) one or more payments after the first 15 months.
:If you cancel your plan after 18 months, you will not be entitled to a refund of any creation and sales charge. This charge can be up to 50 percent of your periodic investments.

{{Notice|
If you are considering hiring an investment adviser (financial adviser, broker, or investment firm) it is important that you '''check their background credentials''' and any complaints on file. The SEC and FINRA offer free tools to help with this, discussed [[#Background checks | below]].
}}
'''Investment Advisers''' (IA)&lt;ref group=note&gt;U.S. financial law spelling uses ''adviser'', while elsewhere the spelling is ''advisor''.&lt;/ref&gt; are people or firms who are paid to give advice on investing in securities such as stocks, bonds, [[mutual fund]]s, or [[exchange-traded fund]]s (ETFs). Depending on their classification, ''Investment Adviser'' are regulated. For example, an ''Investment Adviser'' who registers with the [http://www.sec.gov/ Securities and Exchange Commission] (SEC) must follow a fiduciary standard to act in their client's best interest. An adviser registered with the SEC is known as a ''Registered Investment Adviser'' (RIA).

== Investment advisers ==
Although many of the people who work at advisory firms fall under the definition of "investment adviser," the SEC generally does not require them to register individually as advisers with the SEC. Instead, the advisory ''firm'' itself must register with the SEC. The firm's registration covers its employees ''and'' other people under its control, provided they are working on the firm's behalf.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.sec.gov/about/offices/oia/oia_investman/rplaze-042006.pdf| title=The Regulation of Investment Advisers| publisher=SEC.gov| date=November 22, 2006| accessdate=August 31, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, only firms can be ''Registered Investment Advisers'' (RIA), while its employees can only be ''Investment Adviser Representatives'' (IAR).&lt;ref&gt;{{forum link| p=1198928| title=A Firm is an RIA, Not a Person| date=October 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Registered Investment Advisers'' may not use the term “registered investment adviser” unless they are registered, nor can they use it to suggest a level of professional competence, education or special training. The term "RIA" should not appear after a person’s name, because using initials after a name usually indicates a degree or a licensed professional position requiring qualifications, and there are no federal qualifications for becoming an SEC-registered adviser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.sec.gov/divisions/investment/advoverview.htm| title=Information for Newly-Registered Investment Advisers| publisher=SEC.gov| date=November 23, 2010| accessdate=August 31, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, someone could not use "RIA" on their business card.&lt;ref&gt;{{forum link| t=83550| title=A Firm is an RIA, Not a Person| date=October 3, 2011| author=[[Rick Ferri]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Investment advisers who manage less than $100 million in assets must register with the state securities agency in the state where they have their principal place of business.&lt;ref name="RIA"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Registered_investment_adviser| title=Registered investment adviser| publisher=Wikipedia| accessdate=August 31, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anyone registered with the FINRA typically makes commissions and fees from the products they sell (brokerage or mutual fund company). They must provide their clients with products that are "[[#Suitability|suitable]]" (the suitability standard), but not necessarily the cheapest or the best.&lt;ref name="SECFin"&gt;{{forum link| p=1189157| title=Investment Advisor or do it ourselves| date=September 26, 2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulations==
Section 202(a)(11)(C) of the [[wikipedia:Investment Advisers Act of 1940|Investment Advisers Act of 1940]] exempts&lt;ref name="RIA" /&gt; from the definition of an ''Investment Adviser'' (and therefore the associated fiduciary standard){{blockquote|... any ''broker or dealer'' whose performance of such services is solely incidental to the conduct of his business as a broker or dealer and who receives no special compensation therefor.}}

In [https://www.sec.gov/file/release-nos-34-51523 Release 34-51523], the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) (the US Securities Self Regulatory Organization (SRO) with authority over ''Brokers and Dealers'') determined that Broker-Dealers are "not to be deemed investment advisers" and therefore are not required to follow the same fiduciary standards as ''Investment Advisers'' when recommending investments to clients (as are ''Registered Investment Advisers'' (RIA)).

Registered Representatives (RRs) affiliated with a [[wikipedia:Broker-dealer|Broker-dealer]] must therefore recommend securities that are deemed "[[#Suitability|suitable]]" for non-institutional clients.

===Suitability===
''Suitability'' means that a broker can sell ''any'' fund or any investment as long as it fits the purpose. For example, if stocks are suitable for an investor, then it does not matter if a broker advises an 8% load stock fund that has 3% in annual fees because it is agreed that stocks in general are a suitable, and so any diversified stock mutual fund will do.&lt;ref name="RF"&gt;{{forum link| p=1192950| title=Ameriprise employees sue firm for lousy 401k choices| date=September 30, 2011| author=[[Rick Ferri]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Suitability is entirely different from fiduciary standard. Under a fiduciary standard, an investment adviser must not only recommend suitable investments, but they must also recommend funds that are in the best interest of their client. Clearly, a fund with an 8% load and 3% in fees is not in the best interest of anyone. Low-cost index funds are in the best interest of clients.&lt;ref name="RF" /&gt;

This is the difference between a broker's investment recommendations under a ''suitability'' standard, and an investment adviser's recommendations under a ''fiduciary'' standard.&lt;ref name="RF" /&gt;

===Fiduciary standard===
On April 8, 2016, the Department of Labor issued revised regulations which widens the definition of a ''fiduciary'' for advisers who have control over retirement plans. This aims to avoid a conflict of interest between an adviser (including a broker-dealer) and the client. Firms must have complied with these new rules by July 1, 2019. Before July 1, 2019, advisers could ''intend'' to comply with these rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ebsa/ebsa20171127-0| title=U.S. Department of Labor Extends Transition Period For Fiduciary Rule Exemptions| publisher=US Department of Labor| accessdate=August 31, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Before July 1, 2019, the Department of Labor did not pursue claims against fiduciaries who worked diligently and in good faith to comply with the Fiduciary Rule.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background checks==
If you are considering hiring an investment adviser (financial adviser, broker, or investment firm) it is important that you '''check their background credentials''' and any complaints on file. The SEC and FINRA offer free tools to help you do this.

It is a good idea for you to use both tools. If you cannot find a financial adviser in the SEC's Investment Adviser Public Disclosure (IARD) database, but you do find them in FINRA's Broker Check, you can consider this adviser to be a product salesperson.&lt;ref name="SECFin" /&gt;

===SEC Investment Adviser Public Disclosure===
The SEC's Investment Adviser Public Disclosure (IAPD) database provides information about current and former Investment Adviser Representatives (IARs) and Investment Adviser firms registered with the SEC and/or state securities regulators.&lt;ref name="IAS"&gt;[http://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=1188999#p1188999 Investment Advisor or do it ourselves], forum discussion, direct link to post.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[https://adviserinfo.sec.gov/ Investment Adviser Search], from the [http://www.sec.gov/ SEC]
Choose either ''Individual'' or ''Firm'' to start. Be sure browser cookies are enabled. The results will contain links to "Investment Adviser Firm" or "Brokerage Firm" as applicable.

====Brokerage firm====
The Brokerage Firm link will launch into the FINRA's BrokerCheck ([[#FINRA BrokerCheck |below]]) which provides additional information such as a state-by-state breakdown where a broker is licensed to practice, or if any complaints have been filed.

====Investment adviser firm====
The "Investment Adviser Firm" link goes to Form ADV (Uniform Application for Investment Adviser Registration), each section appearing in a menu on the left-hand side. Among other items, you can use Form ADV to see if a firm offers [[Financial planning | financial planning]], as opposed to providing investment advice.&lt;ref name="Kennedy"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://simplesmartinvesting.com/?p=175| title=How to select an investment adviser| date=March 10, 2013| author=Ian Kennedy| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313201150/http://simplesmartinvesting.com/?p=175| archive-date=March 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Go to "Item 5 Information About Your Advisory Business" in the ADV form and look for:

*5F(1): Do you provide continuous and regular supervisory or management services to securities portfolios? 

If the answer to 5F(1) is ''No'', this firm is not in the investment advisory business. It might give investment advice and sell investment products, but that does not make it an investment adviser that you want to manage your money.

Critically important is "Item 11 Disclosure Information." Every "No" box on this page should be checked, because a "Yes" indicates that the firm has violated some of the laws and regulations governing registered investment advisers.

Where a "Yes" is present, the firm must detail on form ADV the date and nature of the infraction, and how it was settled. A minor infraction, perhaps from some administrative error involving small amounts of money, may be forgiven, but you want to closely scrutinize any "Yes" on this page.&lt;ref name="Kennedy" /&gt;

===FINRA BrokerCheck===
The [http://www.finra.org/index.htm Financial Industry Regulatory Authority], known as FINRA, is the largest non-governmental regulator for all securities firms doing business with the United States public—more than 5,000 firms employing more than 660,000 registered representatives. FINRA was created in 2007, consolidating NASD and NYSE Member Regulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.finra.org/AboutFINRA/| title=About the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority| publisher=FINRA| accessdate=August 31, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FINRA BrokerCheck is a free tool to help investors check the professional background of current and former FINRA-registered securities firms and brokers. It should be the first resource you turn to when choosing whether to do business with a particular broker or brokerage firm. Note that financial advisers can also be registered brokers.
*[https://brokercheck.finra.org/ BrokerCheck]
Enable browser cookies. At the report summary, select "View Full PDF Report" (upper right corner) to get the full details. If applicable, the FINRA report will show any complaints filed against the adviser.

==Investment advisory fees==
Some advisers may not charge for managing money market funds. If the exclude money market funds in the total portfolio value, you may be paying a different fee than you expect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Forum link| title=Wiki - Investment adviser - Advisory fees may not include money market funds| t=393371| author=LadyGeek| date=December 27, 2022}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Please check your adviser's service agreement for this exclusion.

=== Tax deductions ===
Before 2018, you could deduct fees paid to investment advisers for portfolio management ("investment counsel and advice") on your taxes, if the fees exceeded 2% of your adjusted gross income (AGI).&lt;ref group="note"&gt;You used to categorize investment advisory fees, sometimes known as "wrap fees", as a miscellaneous itemized deduction. Miscellaneous itemized deductions have been removed from the tax code. See: [[Outline of tax law changes]].&lt;/ref&gt;

After 2018, you can no longer deduct advisory fees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.schwab.com/learn/story/investment-expenses-whats-tax-deductible| title=Investment Expenses: What's Tax Deductible?| publisher=Charles Schwab| date=December 6, 2022| accessdate=August 31, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 6, 2013 Vanguard announced the creation of '''four fund portfolios''' by adding a strategic allocation of [[Developed market bonds|international hedged bonds]] to the firm's series of target date ([[Vanguard Target Retirement Funds|Target Retirement]]) and target risk ([[Vanguard LifeStrategy Funds|LifeStrategy]]) funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://pressroom.vanguard.com/content/press_release/2013.02.06_Vanguard_to_Further_Diversify_Target_Retirement_Funds.html| title=Vanguard to Further Diversify Target Retirement Funds| date=February 6, 2013| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190117081102/https://pressroom.vanguard.com/content/news/2013.02.06_Vanguard_to_Further_Diversify_Target_Retirement_Funds.html| archive-date=January 17, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; These funds are commonly offered by [[Employer Retirement Plans Overview|employer provided plans]], where they are often default investment options; in [[529 plans|529 college savings plans]]; and in [[IRA|individual retirement arrangements]].

The allocation plan adds the Vanguard International Bond Index fund to the portfolio asset mix. This bond fund is hedged to reduce currency risk.

==Three fund and four fund portfolios==

Prior to the addition of an international bond fund to the target date and target risk funds, the allocation of these balanced portfolios were versions of the very popular [[Three-Fund Portfolio|three fund portfolio]],&lt;ref&gt;{{forum link| t=88005| title=The Three Fund Portfolio}}&lt;/ref&gt; which consists of three broad asset class index funds:
* Total U.S. stock market index fund
* Total international stock index fund
* Total U.S. bond index fund

The four-fund portfolio that Vanguard is now using consists of the following broad asset class index funds:
* Total U.S. stock market index fund
* Total international stock index fund
* Total U.S. bond index fund
* Total international bond index fund

From 2013 - 2015 Vanguard allocated 30% of a portfolio's stock allocation to international stocks and allocated 20% of a portfolio's nominal bond allocation to international bonds.

Beginning in 2015, Vanguard increased the international allocations to the four fund portfolios. International stock allocations increased from 30% to 40% of a portfolio's stock allocation. International bonds increased from 20% to 30% of a portfolio's nominal bond allocation. The allocation changes began in the second quarter of 2015 and were completed before year-end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://institutional.vanguard.com/VGApp/iip/site/institutional/researchcommentary/article/NewsInstinfo022615QA| title=2015 changes to Target Retirement Funds, Q&amp;A| publisher=Vanguard Institutional| date=February 26, 2015| accessdate=28 February 2015}}{{dead link}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://institutional.vanguard.com/VGApp/iip/site/institutional/researchcommentary/article/NewsInstinfo022615| title=Expanded target-date lineup, more diversification| publisher=Vanguard| date=February 26, 2015| accessdate=August 9, 2015}}{{dead link}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==MATLAB clones==
MATLAB® (MATrix LABoratory) is a high-level language and interactive environment for numerical computation, visualization, and programming. It is neither open source nor free. However, it's an industry standard and open source clones have been developed which strive to emulate MATLAB functionality.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;See [http://www.dspguru.com/dsp/links/matlab-clones Matlab Clones] for a detailed overview.&lt;/ref&gt;

Below are examples which run in [http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/ Octave] or MATLAB. Bogleheads forum member camontgo developed and maintains this code at [http://www.calculatinginvestor.com/ The Calculating Investor].

===Efficient frontier (mean-variance optimization)===
This is a 3-part series which calculates the efficient frontier for a set of securities.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The example covariance matrix could be replaced with a real covariance matrix. For example, the R-script for downloading Yahoo Finance returns could be used to get returns for a set of assets, and the covariance matrix could be calculated and used as the input to these scripts...though the scaling would probably need to be changed.&lt;/ref&gt; These efficient frontier calculations are not very practical. The results are too sensitive to small changes in the inputs, but it is educational since a lot of financial theory builds on some of the ideas underlying Markowitz.&lt;ref name="PM"&gt;camontgo PM to LadyGeek.&lt;/ref&gt;

*Calculating the Efficient Frontier: [http://www.calculatinginvestor.com/2011/06/07/efficient-frontier-1/ Part 1], [http://www.calculatinginvestor.com/2011/06/14/efficient-frontier-part-2/ Part 2], [http://www.calculatiginvestor.com/2011/06/21/efficient-frontier-3/ Part 3], from [http://www.calculatinginvestor.com/ The Calculating Investor]

===Rebalancing bonus===
This is a replication of an analysis by [[William Bernstein]] which performs a Monte Carlo analysis of two portfolios to determine the ''rebalancing bonus''. This simulation adds some math which allows simulation of rebalancing with correlated assets. Bernstein's original analysis assumed no correlation.&lt;ref name="PM" /&gt;

===Market timing===
In 1975, Nobel laureate William Sharpe published a study titled “Likely Gains from Market Timing”. In this paper, Sharpe reportedly found that a market timer who switches between 100% stocks and 100% T-bills on an annual basis must be correct about 74% of the time (on average) to beat the market.&lt;ref name="Mkt"&gt;[http://www.calculatinginvestor.com/2011/02/21/market-timing/ Market Timing: How good is good enough?], from [http://www.calculatinginvestor.com/ The Calculating Investor]&lt;/ref&gt;

This Monte Carlo simulation uses a simple market timing strategy to determine the market timing accuracy required to outperform buy-and-hold. A comparison of market timing to buy-and-hold in terms of both total returns and risk-adjusted returns (measured by the Sharpe Ratio) is performed. The analysis shows that a surprisingly high (and unlikely) degree of accuracy is necessary to beat the market return through market timing.&lt;ref name="PM" /&gt;
*[http://www.calculatinginvestor.com/2011/02/21/market-timing/ Market Timing: How good is good enough?], from [http://www.calculatinginvestor.com/ The Calculating Investor]
The factor data is obtained from the [http://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/data_library.html Kenneth R. French - Data Library], under [http://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/ftp/F-F_Research_Data_Factors.zip  Fama/French Factors] (direct link). Be sure to remove the file headers and the extra data sets (starting around row 1046). Save the file as F-F_Factors_annual.txt.

This simulation takes a long time to run. To start, reduce the number of iterations from 10,000 to a lower number (such as 100) and ensure that the analysis is functioning correctly.

==Python==
[http://www.python.org/ Python] is a rapid development scripting language that is suitable for many tasks.  Using add in libraries like [http://www.numpy.org/ NumPy] and [http://pandas.pydata.org/ pandas] make it easy to do financial analysis. There are many [https://wiki.python.org/moin/IntegratedDevelopmentEnvironments IDEs]

The asset correlation analysis described [[#Asset correlation | above]] is available in Python. See [[finiki:Using open source software for portfolio analysis#Python | finiki]] for the source code.

=== I savings bonds ===
Forum member AnonJohn, with modifications by several members, has developed a script which creates a spreadsheet containing helpful [[I savings bonds|I-Bond]] information, such as keeping track of penalty amounts and interest rates.

The script inputs a spreadsheet containing the bonds' issue data and price. It scrapes rates directly from the Treasury website, so (until that changes format) there is no need for manual updating. This is more convenient than a complex spreadsheet and more complete than the Treasury tool.

This article will address how to incorporate the investment options in [[Employer retirement plans overview | employer retirement plans]] to create a [[Lazy portfolios | lazy portfolio]].&lt;ref group="note"&gt;This technique will work for any list of funds. However, assistance with employer plans is a common request by new investors in the Bogleheads forum; so we will focus on this aspect.&lt;/ref&gt;

The process starts by deciding on a stock / bond asset allocation, reviewing the available funds, then selecting the appropriate funds to create the portfolio. 

The article illustrates two asset allocation plans using a 60% / 40% stock to bond allocation:
*For total market investors: A three-fund indexed portfolio;
*For multifactor ([[Slice and dice |"slice and dice"]]) investors: The seven-fund indexed Coffeehouse portfolio.

==Asset allocation==
{{Main | Asset Allocation}}
The first step when starting an investment program is to choose your [[Asset allocation|asset allocation]], basically your allocation to [[Stock basics|stocks]], [[Bond basics|bonds]], and [[Money markets|cash]]. Be sure to consider this in the context of your entire [[Portfolio|portfolio]]. When beginning participation in an employer's retirement plan, this means incorporating both the plan investments and your existing investments in your overall allocations. The allocations should reflect your return needs balanced against your [[Risk tolerance|tolerance for risk]]. For most investors this will mean hopefully gaining returns that, in the long run, outpace [[CPI|inflation]], while reducing the magnitude of short term investment losses to a level that allows the investor to remain invested without panic selling.

Document your chosen asset allocation in your [[investment policy statement]], if you would not yet have completed it.

==Sample portfolios==
{{main|lazy portfolios}}
The following sample portfolios depict two different asset allocation plans. For illustrative purposes, each portfolio holds a 60 / 40 equity / bond allocation.

===Three-fund portfolio (for total market investors)===
[[File:Newchart.png|thumb|right|Three-fund portfolio with a 60/40 asset allocation]]
The [[Three-fund portfolio |three-fund portfolio]] attempts to simplify the investing process by using three total market [[Indexing|index]] funds holding broadly diversified stock and bond investments. The portfolio is meant to be a buy-hold-and [[Rebalancing|rebalance]] portfolio. The three asset classes required for this portfolio are listed below:&lt;ref group="note"&gt; For example, [http://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=1&amp;t=122957 Forum discussion 401k investment] offers the options displayed in the table below. The plan contains Vanguard target retirement funds and standalone fund selections, which are suitable for creating a three-fund portfolio. (''Open table to view fund options and expense ratios.'')

==Multiple accounts==
{{main|Asset allocation in multiple accounts|Tax-efficient fund placement}}
A frequently encountered situation is that the investment portfolio is allocated to a multiplicity of accounts. For example, a husband and wife may both have employer provider plans, both have personal retirement plans, both have taxable accounts. This equals six accounts.&lt;ref group="note"&gt; In addition to the doubling of marital investment accounts (employer provided retirement accounts, personal retirement accounts, and taxable accounts), it is possible to have even more potential accounts. These additional accounts may include:
* Supplemental employer retirement plans , such as a [[457(b)|457(b) plan]]. 
* Inherited non-spousal IRAs, which, by law, cannot be mingled with other IRA accounts.
* [[Health savings account|Health savings accounts]].
* [[Fixed annuity|Fixed]] or [[Variable annuity|variable]] deferred annuities.
* College savings plans, such as a [[529 plans|529 plan]] or a [[Coverdell Education Savings Account]].
* A [[Charitable remainder trust|charitable remainder trust]] or a [[Charitable pooled income fund|charitable pooled income fund]]. &lt;/ref&gt;

Even if you are a single individual, it is possible to accumulate accounts over an investing lifetime. For example an individual might accumulate a current employer provided plan, a rollover IRA holding the assets from a past job's 401(k) plan, a Roth IRA, and a taxable account.
 
In this situation you would need to repeat the actions over the different accounts:

# Determine our overall asset allocation.
# Perform the checklist on the employer retirement plan as mentioned in the next section.
# Gather the expense ratio for each fund in each account, as well as the tax efficiency. 
# If some accounts do not offer an asset class, or close alternative, then the accounts which do have that asset class should be filled first, with lower expense ratios taking priority.
# Fill in remainder of your total asset allocation with the lowest expense ratios from each account, taking into account the tax considerations. 
# Add up the total amount for each asset class and ensure that your asset allocation is as desired.

==Selecting the funds - Employer plan checklist==
For the chosen asset allocation you then need to review the available funds and select the appropriate ones.

Employer plans can have many investment options, presenting investors with a long list of unfamiliar names. The following checklist can help you find the offerings that can help fill your desired asset allocations. For our sample portfolios, we would be looking for index funds matching our targeted asset classes.

=== Employer plan checklist ===

For each item in the plan fund list, find the available asset class exposure that the funds provide and their [[Expense ratios|expense ratios]].&lt;ref group="note"&gt; 401(k) plans can impose administrative costs on employees in addition to fund expense ratios. Many 401(k) and 403(b) plans are funded with variable annuity contracts which can impose fees in addition to the funds' expense ratios. Make sure you are aware of the total costs. &lt;/ref&gt; This information can usually be found in the fund's fact sheets.&lt;ref group="note"&gt; Hint: Put everything in a spreadsheet. It's easier to make updates and will help when calculating percentages and fund amounts later on.&lt;/ref&gt;

Look for the major asset class categories, such as [[Stock basics|US stock]], [[Domestic/International|international stock]], [[Small caps|small cap stocks]], [[Value tilting - stock|value stocks]] and [[Bond basics|US bonds]]. Fixed income (cash reserves) counts as bonds; company stock funds count as stock. Some bond funds may be listed as "inflation protected." 

Since our desired portfolios are indexed, seek out the plan's index funds, such as the "SSgA S&amp;P 500 Index" (US stocks) or "SSgA US Bond Index" (US bonds) or "SSgA Global Equity Ex US Index" (International stocks, which sometimes have an alphabet soup of acronyms like [[MSCI EAFE index|MSCI EAFE]]). The fund's fact sheet will list the asset allocation information.&lt;ref group="note"&gt; For an example of a plan with a mixture of index funds and active funds on the plan fund menu, see the fund options in the plan revealed in [http://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=1&amp;t=123516 Any good funds in this list], forum discussion.

Employer provided plans typically contain at least one or two index funds. Some plans may have a [[Self directed brokerage account|brokerage window]] that provides access to a wider selection of indexed investment options, but be sure to calculate the expected cost of using this service, taking into account all fees that would apply and compare it to the cost of using the fund choices in the qualified plan in order to help guide the decision. 

The plan may not provide total market index funds. A common example is a plan offering only an [[S&amp;P 500 index]] fund. You may want to approximate the total market by using funds that "complete" the S&amp;P 500 index. Similarly, plans often provide international exposure with a developed market index fund, which lacks the [[Emerging market stocks|emerging market stocks]] and small cap international stocks included in international total market funds. (You may not need to replicate a total market fund for every asset class if you can hold total market funds in other accounts.) 

If you decide to reconstitute a total market fund using multiple funds, you can find detailed information on how to approximate total market allocations at:
*[[Approximating total stock market]] 
*[[Approximating total international stock market]]

The plan may only contain actively managed funds. In this circumstance you should select the lowest cost stock funds and highest grade bond funds that approximate the targeted assets classes.&lt;ref group="note"&gt; For example, 
[http://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=1&amp;t=123565 401k Choices Seem Expensive], forum discussion reveals a 401(k) plan offering only active funds. (''Open table to reveal fund options and expense ratios'').

|} &lt;/ref&gt; (''Extended illustration in footnotes'').

Note that if you hold [[#Multiple accounts|multiple accounts]], you need not hold each of your portfolio's asset classes ''within'' the employer plan, unless you prefer to mirror the allocation in each account. The allocations can be spread across accounts (as an example: holding the bond allocations in an employer plan; the US stock investments in a personal IRA, and holding international investments in a [[Principles of tax-efficient fund placement|taxable account]].)

==Target date retirement funds==

A good default option for employer provider plans is to place your contributions and employer matches into a [[Target date retirement funds|target date retirement fund]]. 

Some plans may provide you with target retirement plans with indexed target date funds which can provide you with a variant of the three-fund portfolio. Examples would include plans holding Vanguard target retirement funds and the [[Thrift Savings Plan]] target retirement fund series.

If you are thinking of using a target date fund be aware that many plans offer retirement date funds that invest in a large number of actively managed funds. You need to carefully check the underlying funds to see if they truly match your desired allocation.&lt;ref group="note"&gt; For example, Fidelity Freedom 2035 Target Date fund employs 24 actively managed funds as the underlying investments for the fund (see [https://fundresearch.fidelity.com/mutual-funds/composition/315792655 Analyze the Fidelity Freedom 2035 Fund (FFTHX) composition]). American funds employ 17 active funds in its [https://americanfundsretirement.retire.americanfunds.com/about/funds/details.htm?ticker=AAFTX target fund]. T. Rowe Price uses 17 active funds and one index fund in its [http://www3.troweprice.com/fb2/fbkweb/composition.do?ticker=TRRJX 2035 fund]. American Century uses 13 active funds in its [https://ipro.americancentury.com/ipro/product/mf/holdings/954.jsp#ARYIX 2035 target fund]&lt;/ref&gt;

An advantage of tax-deferred accounts is that you can transfer among the different funds without paying taxes on the gains. In other words, you are not stuck with this decision. There is no penalty for changing your mind later. If you feel more confident about lowering your expenses by going to separate low-cost funds at a later time, you are free to do so.

===Using a target date fund to approximate a lazy portfolio===
{{Main | Approximating Vanguard target date funds}}
If you are a novice investor seeking to use a three-fund or four fund portfolio, Vanguard's [[Target date retirement funds]] can provide models for your portfolio since they are nothing more than lazy portfolios, using total market index funds, designed and managed by investment professionals. Your decision is to simply align your desired asset allocations with the appropriate target retirement fund.

Refer to the [[Approximating Vanguard target date funds|main article]] for a comprehensive overview. 

==Inflation-protected securities==
Bond funds identified as inflation-protected, like [[Treasury Inflation Protected Security | TIPS]], are somewhat different than a conventional bond fund. Their purpose is to help diversify your portfolio further by providing some protection against inflation.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Inflation-protected securities actually protect against ''unexpected'' inflation, which is not discussed here.&lt;/ref&gt;

One Boglehead approach is to add inflation-protected securities to the bond portion of your portfolio, perhaps up to 50% of the bond allocation. The choice is arbitrary - from not using any inflation-protected fund up to 50% (or more). The decision is based on a level of comfort (can you sleep well at night) rather than one based on theory.

Note that some of the examples and references date back to 2013, and the applicable values may no longer be accurate.  Nonetheless the methodology should still be applicable.}}
'''{{PAGENAME}}''' aims to help you if you are saving and investing in an [[Employer retirement plans overview|employer provided plan]] and want to approximate a Vanguard target date fund based on the funds in your plan. 

If you are lucky enough to have an employer plan with a wide selection of low-cost asset class index funds, you can probably closely approximate a target date fund with a limited number of funds. 

However, you may find that your plan has high costs, offering a lot of funds but few of which are index funds. For you, creating a simple, low cost approximation can be more difficult. You might need to use other accounts to reach the asset allocation you are aiming for.

This article describes the how to approximate a target date fund, and include a comprehensive example. It also shows several cases where approximating target retirement funds is suitable.

==Principles of approximating Vanguard target date funds==
[[File:Fourfunds.png|thumb|right| Four-fund portfolio&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The above graphic represents that there are four primary components to a target date fund. It does not indicate that a typical allocation is 25% in each.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The [[Vanguard target retirement funds|Vanguard target date retirement funds]] are '''[[Vanguard four fund portfolio|four-fund portfolios]].''' The four asset class index funds making up this buy-hold-and rebalance portfolio are:
* A US total stock market index fund
* A total international stock market index fund
* A US total bond market index fund
* A total international bond market index fund
The Vanguard Target Retirement Income fund, as well as the funds that are closing in on their target dates add a fifth fund, the Vanguard Short-Term Inflation Indexed Bond Index. 

Target date funds change allocations over time. If you approximate a target retirement fund you will need to '''change allocations regularly''' to follow changes in the target retirement fund you are approximating. See table [[Vanguard target retirement funds#Detailed fund allocations|Vanguard target retirement funds - Detailed fund allocations]].

Before Vanguard added international bonds, target funds held the [[three-fund portfolio]] without international bonds. If you want to approximate a target retirement fund, but you do not want to hold international bonds, you can replace these international bonds with domestic bonds.

==Constituent total market funds==
The three-fund and four-fund portfolios have one thing in common: Every index fund name contains "total." This section shows the "total" index fund compositions.

===US total stock market funds===
{| class="wikitable" style="float:right; margin-left:10px"

| {{MStarStylebox|26|22|24|6|6|7|3|3|3}}

These funds invest in the investable US public stock markets, weighting stocks according to their [[Market capitalization|market capitalization]]. They will include large-cap, [[Mid caps|mid-cap]], and [[Small caps|small-cap]] stocks. A [https://www.morningstar.com/content/dam/marketing/apac/au/pdfs/Legal/Stylebox_Factsheet.pdf style box] shows the percentage of stocks in each weighting category. Summing all categories equals 100%.  The weighting of these components can change over time. Current Vanguard and Fidelity total US stock market fund weightings are available [https://www.morningstar.com/funds/xnas/vtsax/portfolio here] and [https://www.morningstar.com/funds/xnas/fskax/portfolio here]. 

====Approximating US total stock market funds====
{{main|Approximating total stock market}}
It is likely that you will find only an [[S&amp;P 500 Index|S&amp;P 500 index]] fund in your retirement plan. In this case, for total market coverage you need to add a [[Extended market index fund|completion index]] fund, or a combination of mid cap and small cap index funds. 

In some cases, you may have these funds in your plan. The [[Thrift Savings Plan]], the federal workers retirement savings plan, for example, offers both an S&amp;P 500 index fund and an extended market completion index fund. Some plans may also offer a mid cap index fund and a small cap index fund in addition to the S&amp;P 500 index fund, which makes it possible to approximate the US total market. 

====Without suitable options for US total stock market funds====
If your plan lacks suitable options to capture the rest of market, you may be able to do this by:
* Investing in these completion indexes in a personal retirement plan or taxable account;
* Forgo investing in the S&amp;P 500 fund and hold the total market fund allocation in a personal retirement plan or taxable account.
* If married, invest in these completion indexes in your spouse's accounts.
* If married, forgo investing in the S&amp;P 500 fund and hold the total market fund allocation in one of your spouse's accounts.

===Total international stock market index fund===
The most complete total international index funds invest in both developed market and emerging market stocks, and hold market allocations to large-cap, mid-cap, and small-cap stocks. 

===Approximating total international stock market index fund===
{{main|Approximating total international stock market}}
Some international index funds will only cover developed markets, and many international index funds only include large-cap and mid-cap stocks. In these cases, you can consider adding emerging market and small cap international index funds. Depending on the specific indexes used for developed markets and emerging markets, completely replicating the total market could mean that you need to add Canadian and South Korean index funds.

The approximate breakdown between developed market, emerging market, and global-ex US small cap stocks is:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://institutional.vanguard.com/investments/product-details/fund/0113| title=Vanguard Total International Fund| publisher=Vanguard}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Developed market: 65%
*Emerging market: 20%
*Global ex-US small cap: 15%

Depending on the availability of emerging market and small cap international index funds, you might be able to add them in your employer's plan, in your individual retirement plans or taxable accounts, or if married, in your spouse's accounts. An additional option is to forgo investing in a developed market index fund and hold a total international index fund in another account (if married, this can also include a spouse's account).

===Total US bond index funds===
In the US, a total bond index is commonly benchmarked to the [[Bloomberg US Aggregate Bond Index]], which benchmarks investment grade taxable bonds. These include [[Treasury bonds|treasury]] and [[Government agency bonds|government agency]] bonds, investment grade [[Corporate bonds|corporate bonds]], [[Mortgage-backed securities|mortgage-backed securities]] and [[Asset-backed securities|asset-backed securities]]. The index does not include [[Treasury Inflation Protected Securities|Treasury inflation protected securities]], [[High yield bonds|high yield]] bonds, [[Floating rate bonds|floating rate]] bonds, or [[Municipal bonds|municipal]] bonds. The total US bond market index has an intermediate term duration.

===Total international bond index funds===
Most forum investors will be considering the Vanguard international bond index fund, which is hedged against currencies, and invests in international government, agency, and corporate bonds, primarily from developed countries. The index has an intermediate term duration.

==Example of approximating a Vanguard target date fund==
Below is an illustrative example, as of August 31, 2013, which builds a target date fund asset allocation from a 401(k) plan's list of available funds.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;See {{forum link| t=122977| title=First 401(k) Advice}}. Disclaimer: The examples have no relation to the member's situation and are only illustrative.&lt;/ref&gt; The plan has:
*A lot of choices.
*Target retirement funds, but in this case these are inappropriate because they are [https://www.fidelity.com/mutual-funds/asset-allocation-funds/freedom-funds/overview Fidelity Freedom® Funds] that use 24 active funds.&lt;ref group="note"&gt; Actively managed target retirement funds often are a compilation of a large collection of actively managed funds. Here are the fund tallies from four large mutual fund complexes for target date 2035 funds:

*A Balanced fund, [https://fundresearch.fidelity.com/mutual-funds/summary/31634R109 Fidelity® Multi-Asset Index Fund], which approximates three quarters of the Vanguard target retirement fund (lacks international bonds) but comes with the limitation of having only one asset allocation (85% stocks/ 14% bonds).
*U.S. and international stock total market indexes and a US bond index that match three quarters of the Vanguard target retirement fund and fulfill the requirements for a three-fund portfolio.
*A developed international market index.
*Additional bond indexes.

===Goal===
The following examples use an asset allocation of 60% / 40% stocks to bonds. By design, Vanguard allocates 28% of a target date fund's stock allocation to international stocks and allocates 20% of a portfolio's bond allocation to international bonds. The [{{Vf | 0682}} Vanguard Target Retirement 2020 Fund (VTWNX)] is the closest match and holds the following total market index funds:&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The allocations below represent the Vanguard 2020 fund as they were in 2013.  The allocations as of today have significantly changed, as indicated in the above link, with a lower stock allocation and a higher bond allocation.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Approximating the U.S stock market allocation===
This plan holds a total U.S. stock market index fund. Replace the Vanguard funds as shown in the spreadsheet under "A total US stock market fund is available." Because it lacks a total international bond market index, one option is to use the US bond index fund in place of the international bond index fund. Round the asset allocations to the nearest 5%.

The following scenarios show how to approximate the U.S. total market segment, if we assume that the plan ''did not provide'' a total U.S. stock market index.

====No U.S. total stock market index fund is available (completion index)====
If the plan lacks a U.S. total stock market index fund, you can use the available completion index fund and reconstitute the total US market slice of the portfolio as follows:

S&amp;P 500 index fund with completion index fund. The total market approximation split would be: 
* S&amp;P 500 index: 80% of the US stock allocation
* Completion index: 20% of the US stock allocation.

Refer to in the spreadsheet under "If a total US stock market index fund is not available (Completion index)."  In this case, entering FXSIX (holding value of 80%) and FSEVX (holding value of 20%) will result in a Total US Stock style box that's very close to the one shown [[#US total stock market funds|above]].

Split the US total stock market index share by these percentages as shown:

*S&amp;P 500 index: 34.8% = 80% of 43.6%
*Completion index: 8.72% = 20% of 43.6%

This example uses extra precision (more decimal places) to show the methodology. In practice you round the final asset allocations to the nearest 5%. Rounding the example percentages gives this allocation:

*S&amp;P 500 index: 35%
*Completion index: 10%

====No U.S. total stock market index fund is available (small-cap and mid-cap)====
If the plan lacks both the U.S. total stock market index and a completion index fund, you could use the available small-cap and mid-cap index funds to approximate the US total market index:

S&amp;P 500 index fund with a mid-cap index fund and a small-cap index fund. The total market approximation split would be:
*S&amp;P 500: 80% of the US stock allocation
*Mid cap index: 5% of the US stock allocation
*Small cap index: 15% of the US stock allocation.

Refer to in the spreadsheet under "If a total US stock market index fund is not available (Mid-cap, small-cap)." As stated previously, use Morningstar's [https://www.morningstar.com/instant-x-ray Instant X-Ray]. In this case, entering FXSIX (holding value of 80%), FSCKX (holding value of 5%), and VSCIX (holding value of 15%) will result in a Total US Stock style box that's very close to the one shown [[#US total stock market funds|above]].

Split the US total stock market index share by these percentages as shown:

*S&amp;P 500: 34.88 % = 80% of 43.6%
*Mid cap index: 2.18 % = 5% of 43.6%
*Small cap index: 6.54% = 15% of 43.6%

This example uses extra precision (more decimal places) to show the methodology. In practice you round the final asset allocations to the nearest 5%. Rounding the example percentages gives this allocation:

*S&amp;P 500: 35%
*Mid cap index: 5%
*Small cap index: 5%

====No U.S. total stock market index fund is available (S&amp;P 500 index only)====
The plan only has an S&amp;P 500 index fund and neither of the above funds are available. In this case, you would need to use a completion index fund, or a combination of small-cap and mid-cap index funds held in ''other'' accounts (personal retirement accounts, a taxable account, or if married, one of your spouse's accounts) to approximate a total market position.

Otherwise, use the S&amp;P 500 index fund.

In addition, you might decide to totally forgo investing in the plan's US stock funds, by holding the US stock allocation in another account (or if married, in your spouse's account.)

===Approximating the international stock allocation===
This plan holds a total international stock market index fund; which is shown in the spreadsheet under "A total US stock market fund is available."&lt;ref group="note"&gt; Note that the plan's total international index fund tracks the MSCI All-World ex-US index, which covers the world's large-cap and mid-cap stocks. To more completely approximate the Vanguard target date fund allocations, you would need to add a global ex-US small cap fund. &lt;/ref&gt;

The following scenario shows how to approximate the international total market segment if the plan ''did not provide'' a total international index fund.

====No total international stock market index fund is available====
The plan has developed market index fund (SPTN International Index ADV (FSIVX)).

To partially approximate the total international fund, you would invest in the developed market index fund (FSIVX) but would need to add an emerging market index fund to the portfolio in another account. For a closer approximation, you would also need to add a global-ex U.S. small cap international index fund in another account. In this particular scenario, because the plan's developed market index tracks the [[MSCI EAFE index]], the allocation lacks exposure to Canada. If the added emerging market index does not include South Korea, this nation would also be missing from the allocation.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;For a precise replication of a Vanguard retirement date fund allocation to total international markets, see [[Approximating Total International Stock Market]]&lt;/ref&gt; 

In addition, you might decide to totally forgo investing in the plan's international stock funds, by holding the international allocation in another account (or if married, in your spouse's account.)

===Approximating the U.S. bond allocation===
This plan holds a U.S. total bond market index fund; which is shown in the spreadsheet under "A total US stock market fund is available."

The following scenario shows how to approximate the U.S. total bond market index, if we assume that the plan ''did not provide'' a total U.S bond index.

Refer to [[How to build a lazy portfolio#Inflation-protected securities |Inflation-protected securities]] for suggestions on incorporating inflation-protected bonds.

====No U.S. total bond market index fund is available====
The plan has a U.S. intermediate-term Treasury bond index fund available that provides the portfolio with an investment grade intermediate bond allocation. If you want to diversify the bond allocation, you can do it by holding additional bond funds in other accounts.&lt;ref group="note"&gt; If you must hold the total bond market index fund allocation in a taxable account, consider substituting a low-cost intermediate tax-exempt bond fund if this gives you better after-tax returns. &lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, you might decide to totally forgo investing in the plan's US bond funds, by holding the US bond allocation in another account (or if married, in your spouse's account.)

===Approximating the international bond allocation===
This plan does not provide an international bond allocation. You need to add an international bond allocation in another account.

Alternatively, if you do not want to hold international bonds, you could fill this allocation with a U.S. total bond index, U.S. Treasuries, [[How to build a lazy portfolio#Inflation-protected securities |Inflation-protected securities]] or, in taxable accounts, tax-exempt bonds.

[[Bogleheads investment philosophy|Bogleheads]] generally accept that the best portfolios use passive management, low costs, wide diversification and aim for tax efficiency. The simplest way to achieve these is to use a low-cost passive [[Indexing|index fund]]. However, you may find that constructing your own portfolio of individual [[stock]]s offers some cost or tax advantages, and these advantages may be enough to overcome any potential disadvantages from a less diversified portfolio.

In ''Common Sense on Mutual Funds'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=John Bogle| author-link=John Bogle| title=Common Sense on Mutual Funds| pages=373-401| isbn=978-0-470-13813-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Bogle]] suggests that a reasonable alternative to an index fund for some investors would be to hold a well-diversified portfolio of individual stocks, as long as they are held long-term, and minimizing trading costs. This article outlines some suggestions for how to build a portfolio of individual stocks to cover at least part of your overall stock allocation. It also aims to summarize the advantages and possible pitfalls of doing this.

The discussion here assumes that you are not trying to beat the market, but instead '''passively managing individual stocks''' to create your own "DIY index fund."

==Advantages==
Holding a well-diversified portfolio of passively managed individual stocks instead of index funds may give you some cost advantages, and more opportunities for [[Tax loss harvesting|tax-loss harvesting]] and for [[Donating appreciated securities|donating appreciated assets]].

[[Taxation as a US person living abroad|US citizens living abroad]] can have [[US tax pitfalls for a US person living abroad|special difficulties]] using index funds, and these may also make holding individual stocks a suitable option. 

===Costs===
One obvious advantage that individual stocks have over an index fund is an [[Expense ratio|expense ratio]] (ER) of zero. Depending on what class of stocks you are trying to cover, this may or may not be a significant advantage in itself. For example, index funds for single-country or single-industry stocks often have expense ratios of 0.5% or more, and here the saving from using individual stocks would be more substantial than for the broader [[S&amp;P 500 index]].

A hidden cost in mutual funds is the [[Mutual funds: additional costs#Transaction costs|impact of turnover]], because those costs are not reflected in the expense ratio. If you have a lower turnover than a comparable index fund, you will probably have lower turnover costs. And an index fund may be forced to trade, to track companies removed from or added to the index, while someone with a limited portfolio is not forced to make as many changes.

===Taxes===
Individual stocks offer many more opportunities for tax-loss harvesting than index funds. Estimates put the potential advantage at about 0.5%/year, depending on your tax bracket.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author1=Robert D. Arnott| author2=Andrew L. Berkin Ph.D| author3=Jia Ye Ph.D| url=https://www.firstquadrant.com/downloads/The_Management.pdf| title=Tax Management and Mismanagement of Taxable Assets| date=2000| publisher=First Quadrant| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061018073306/http://www.firstquadrant.com/downloads/The_Management.pdf| archive-date=October 18, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author1=Robert D. Arnott| author2=Andrew L. Berkin Ph.D| author3=Jia Ye Ph.D| url=https://www.firstquadrant.com/downloads/Tax_Management_Loss.pdf| title=Tax Management, Loss Harvesting, and HIFO Accounting| date=2003| publisher=First Quadrant| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061018072846/http://www.firstquadrant.com/downloads/Tax_Management_Loss.pdf| archive-date=October 18, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If you have individual stocks you can find additional tax management benefits through donations, gifting and dividend yield management. The [[#Tax management| tax management section]] below discusses these in more depth.

====US taxpayers abroad====
In particular, if you are a US taxpayer living outside the US (but still subject to citizenship-based taxation):
* US tax law treats almost all locally-domiciled and non-US domiciled index funds as a [[passive foreign investment company]] (PFIC), and this creates extremely unfavorable taxation; and
* US-domiciled funds may not be available to you, or they may have unfavorable or double taxation in your country of residence, or they may have high expense ratios (for example, single-country funds covering your country of residence).
Given these constraints, US taxpayers living outside the US may find that a portfolio of individual stocks is the best way to invest.

==Disadvantages==
Although creating a portfolio of individual stocks has some advantages, keep the following in mind. An individual stock portfolio will be less diversified than the market portfolio, and will be exposed to the problem of market skewness. Also, a portfolio of individual stocks is likely to need more bookkeeping than investing in a total market index fund. Finally, empirical studies have shown that investors are susceptible to [[behavioral pitfalls]] that result in poor performance. 

===Diversification===
By definition, any subset of stocks is less diversified than the whole market, and so exposes you to greater [[Risk and return: an introduction#Specific_types_of_risk|unsystematic risk]].

===Skewness===
Individual stocks generally exhibit positive [[skewness]], meaning that most stocks will have a somewhat lower return than the market average, with a few having much higher return. As noted by Bernstein&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=William Bernstein| author-link=William Bernstein| url=http://www.efficientfrontier.com/ef/900/15st.htm| title=The 15-Stock Diversification Myth| date=2000| publisher=Efficient Frontier| accessdate=November 13, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many others, any subset of stocks is likely have a lower return than the whole market, due to failing to include some of the highest performers; that is, the median return is lower than the mean return.

Skewness is more pronounced in smaller stocks, so that a strategy of investing only in Large Capital individual stocks (and using mutual funds for diversification in other areas) tends to be less exposed to this issue.

===Documentation===
You will have to track more cost bases (see [[Passively managing individual stocks#Record keeping|below]]) for a collection of individual stocks than for a single index fund, depending on how you made the purchases (for example, single lump-sum into the index instead of monthly purchases). In addition, individual stocks sometimes create taxable or other paperwork-generating events such as going private, getting bought out, going bankrupt and splitting. This is particularly the case with smaller cap stocks.

===Behavioral effects===
Owning individual stocks instead of an index fund is like seeing how the proverbial sausage is made.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;This is an idiomatic phrase, meaning that knowledge of the underlying process may be unpleasant.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of your stocks will rocket up, some will go out of business, and, because of the skewness mentioned [[#Skewness |above]], the majority will underperform the market as a whole. Of course, the same things happen inside an index fund, but hidden from view. While these gyrations can give you opportunities to save tax, they also take some getting used to. Not everyone wants to watch the sausage production process in their portfolio with equanimity. Know yourself.

These difficulties are evident in empirical studies of the stock trading [[Behavioral pitfalls|behavior]] of individual stock market investors. [[Terrance Odean|Odean]] and [[Brad M. Barber|Barber]] have studied individual performance (beginning in 1991)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author1=Brad M.

==How many stocks?==
There are several different ways to estimate the minimum number of stocks you should aim to hold. A few approaches found in the academic literature are discussed here. While none of the papers discussed below provide a definitive answer to that question, they may help to give you some ideas.

===Meir Statman===
[[Meir Statman]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Meir Statman| author-link=Meir Statman| url=https://ssrn.com/abstract=365241| title=How Much Diversification is Enough?| date=October 2002| accessdate=November 13, 2023}} Available at SSRN.&lt;/ref&gt; provides the following formula for the benefit &lt;math&gt;B_{nm}&lt;/math&gt; in terms of risk-adjusted return gained by moving from &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; stocks to &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; stocks:
:&lt;math&gt;
B_{nm} = \left(\sqrt{\frac{\frac{1}{n}+\frac{n-1}{n}\rho}{\frac{1}{m}+\frac{m-1}{m}\rho}}-1\right)EP
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the expected correlation between any pair of stocks, and &lt;math&gt;EP&lt;/math&gt; is the expected equity premium. (In his paper, he uses &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; = 0.08,&lt;ref group="note"&gt; Estimate for 1997 from p. 23 of John Y. Campbell, Martin Lettau, Burton G. Malkiel, and Yexiao Xu, [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/0022-1082.00318/pdf Have Individual Stocks Become More Volatile? An Empirical Exploration of Idiosyncratic Risk](2001).&lt;/ref&gt; and &lt;math&gt;EP&lt;/math&gt; = 8.79%/year.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The "mean realized equity premium during 1926-2001." But, he also notes, "today there is little agreement that it is a fair estimate of the expected equity premium. Fama and French (2001) estimated the expected equity premium based on P/E ratios and dividend yield. The average of the two is 3.44%." See Fama, Eugene F. and French, Kenneth R., ''[http://ssrn.com/abstract=236590 The Equity Premium]'' (April 2001). EFMA 2001 Lugano Meetings; CRSP Working Paper No. 522. Available at SSRN. &lt;/ref&gt;)

This formula assumes simple Gaussian return distributions with zero skewness (which is known not to be correct, as noted [[#Skewness |above]]), and requires the use of some assumptions about correlation and equity premium, but with those caveats in mind, it is useful to get a ballpark idea of the minimum number of stocks to aim for.

Taking as an example an investor in Canada who is a US taxpayer, for whom the best non-PFIC alternative for covering Canadian stocks might be the [https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239615/ishares-msci-canada-etf iShares MSCI Canada ETF (EWC)]. EWC has &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; = 97 stocks, and an ER of 0.49%/year. If the investor holds at least &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; individual Canadian stocks such that &lt;math&gt;B_{nm}&lt;/math&gt; &lt; 0.49%/year, that investor will have a higher expected risk-adjusted return by holding those individual stocks than by holding the ETF.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;This considers only the difference in ER, and ignores any difference in commissions between buying individual stocks and buying EWC, currency exchange costs incurred to buy EWC (which itself incurs hidden exchange costs internally), any unfavorable tax implications there may be on the Canadian side due to holding an offshore-domiciled ETF, weighting differences, skewness effects, tax loss harvesting, etc.&lt;/ref&gt; Using the somewhat bold assumption that &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;EP&lt;/math&gt; for the Canadian market are similar to the values Statman uses above for the US market, the investor expectantly comes out ahead over EWC after about 50 stocks.

For another example, a US taxpayer in Japan might consider [https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239665/ishares-msci-japan-etf iShares MSCI Japan ETF (EWJ)] for Japanese equities, which has 317 holdings and 0.49%/year expense ratio. That investor would have a higher expected risk-adjusted return than EWJ after about 75 individual Japanese stocks.

For the above two investors, the minimum required number of stocks would go down if possible savings due to tax-loss harvesting are taken into account. However, since they both have to pay taxes to two different governments, based on gains and losses calculated in two different currencies that float relative to each other, the tax-loss harvesting opportunities would likely be considerably reduced as compared to a taxpayer subject only to one country's tax code.

A US-based investor, on the other hand, might instead expect for tax-loss harvesting to provide a bigger benefit than ER savings. In comparison to an S&amp;P 500 index fund such as the [{{Vf | 0968}} Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF (VOO)] with ER of 0.05%/year, if the expected tax savings from tax loss harvesting are 0.5%/year, that investor would expect to come out ahead of VOO on a risk-adjusted basis after about 75 stocks. If the expected tax savings are 1%/year, that number falls to about 40 stocks. Similar considerations would apply to any investor based outside the US who is not also a US taxpayer.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Or, perhaps, an Eritrean taxpayer, Eritrea being the other country, besides the US, that taxes its non-resident citizens.&lt;/ref&gt;

Note that the minimum number of stocks according to this formula goes down for lower values of &lt;math&gt;EP&lt;/math&gt;, and higher values of &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;.

Meir Statman's formula implicitly assumes portfolios of equally-weighted stocks. For a capitalization-weighted index, the effective number of stocks would be less than the actual number, because the fluctuations of the largest capitalization stocks contribute much more to the overall portfolio volatility than to those of the smallest capitalization stocks (though this would be partially counterbalanced by the higher individual volatilities of smaller-capitalization stocks). If you are comparing a roughly equal-weighted portfolio to a capitalization-weighted index fund, substituting the effective number of stocks in the index for the actual number would produce a somewhat lower suggested minimum number of individual stocks to hold. On the other hand, accounting for skewness should lead to an increase in the suggested minimum number of stocks to hold.

===Ronald Surz and Mitchell Price===
Ronald Surz and Mitchell Price (2000)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author1=Ronald J. Surz| author2=Mitchell Price| url=https://ppca-inc.com/articles/DiversByNumbers.pdf| title=The Truth About Diversification By Numbers| date=2000| publisher=Journal of Investing| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231201153807/https://ppca-inc.com/articles/DiversByNumbers.pdf| archive-date=December 1, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; examine diversification measures such as R-squared and [[Tracking error|tracking error]] for US individual stock selections over the January 1986 - June 1999 period.

Over this period the overall market experienced a [[Standard deviation|standard deviation]] of 14.5%. A single stock portfolio provided an average standard deviation of 45.0%; a fifteen stock portfolio averaged 16.5% (range 14.3% - 19.2%); a thirty stock portfolio averaged 15.4% (range 13.9% - 17.5%); a sixty stock portfolio averaged 15.2% (range 13.6% - 17.2%).

While one individual stock has a standard deviation of 45% and the entire market has 14.5%, portfolios of 30 stocks are shown to eliminate 97% of the excess (diversifiable) standard deviation. A 60 stock portfolio eliminates 98% of excess standard deviation.

Ronald Surz and Mitchell Price found that increasing the number of stocks in a portfolio increased the portfolio's R-squared and reduced portfolio tracking error.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Ronald Surz and Mitchell Price find that for random 15-stock portfolios R-squared averaged 0.76 (range 0.63 - 0.86); for 30-stock portfolios the average was 0.86 (range 0.76 -0.91); for 60-stock portfolios, an average of 0.88 (range 0.79 - 0.94).&lt;br&gt; Tracking errors for random portfolios: 8.1% for 15-stock portfolios; 6.2% for 30-stock portfolios; 5.3% for 60-stock portfolios.&lt;br&gt; Tracking errors for optimized portfolios: 5.4% for 15-stock portfolios; 4.2% for 30-stock portfolios; 3.5% for 60-stock portfolios.&lt;br&gt; Tracking errors for portfolios selecting the largest stocks: 7.5% for 15-stock portfolios; 5.2% for 30-stock portfolios; 4.1% for 60-stock portfolios.&lt;/ref&gt; The authors suggest two methods for reducing tracking error over random stock selection:
# Professional money managers can use portfolio optimization.
# A less sophisticated approach can invest in the largest capitalization stocks.

===David Ikenberry, Richard Shockley and Kent Womack===
David Ikenberry, Richard Shockley and Kent Womack&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author1=David L. Ikenberry| author2=Richard L. Shockley| author3=Kent L. Womack| url=http://www-2.rotman.utoronto.ca/kent.womack/publications/publications/skewness.pdf| title=Why active fund managers often underperform the S&amp;P 500 index: The impact of size and skewness}}{{dead link}}&lt;/ref&gt; use historical backtesting over the 34-year period from 1962 through 1995 to examine the impact of skewness, which they measure as the difference between the mean and median yearly average return for an n-stock portfolio, for several values of n from 15 to 150. They found that for 35-stock portfolios, where the stocks are randomly chosen from the S&amp;P 500 index and equally weighted, the average yearly median portfolio return lags the mean by 0.22%. This number goes down to 0.14% for 50-stock portfolios, 0.09% for 75-stock portfolios, 0.06% for 100-stock portfolios, and 0.03% for 150-stock portfolios. The skewness cost is somewhat lower for capitalization-weighted portfolios, and for equal-weighted portfolios where the probability of selecting a stock is proportional to its market capitalization. For more details, see Table V and Figure 2 of their paper.

They do not find evidence of any systematic return penalty for sub-sampling the S&amp;P 500 index. (However, they are not comparing risk-adjusted returns, just straight returns, so their results cannot be directly compared with, for example, Meir Statman's formula.) They find that for the portfolios where the holdings are capitalization weighted, or equally weighted but selected with a probability proportional to capitalization, the yearly mean and median returns slightly exceed the return of the S&amp;P 500 index itself, though not by statistically significant amounts (about 1-sigma in standard deviation of the mean, if calculated using the yearly numbers in their Table II). They also find that equal-probability, equal-weighted portfolios show about a 2.5% boost in mean and median returns compared to the capitalization-weighted portfolios, and slightly more compared to the S&amp;P 500 index itself. This is only a little over a 2-sigma effect (again, calculating from their yearly numbers in Table II), but suggests the presence of a measurable small-cap premium even within the confines of the S&amp;P 500 universe.

===Dale Domian, David Louton and Marie Racine===
Dale Domian, David Louton and Marie Racine&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author1=Dale L. Domian| author2=David A. Louton| author3=Marie D. Racine| url=https://ssrn.com/abstract=906686| title=Diversification in Portfolios of Individual Stocks: 100 Stocks are Not Enough| date=April 2006| accessdate=November 13, 2023}} Available at SSRN.&lt;/ref&gt; use historical backtesting over the 20-year period from Jan 1985 to Dec 2004 to study the effect of the number of stocks in a portfolio on [[Risk_and_return:_an_introduction#Specific types of risk|shortfall risk]]. They created equal-weighted portfolios from a universe of 1000 stocks, consisting of the 100 largest companies in each of 10 industries, covering 82% of the capitalization of the total market. They calculate ending wealth distributions for random buy-and-hold portfolios of varying numbers of stocks. Using a 1% chance of underperforming US Treasuries over that time period as criterion, they state that at least 164 stocks are needed.

In the context of the present discussion, a more apt comparison might be with the return of a cap-weighted index fund covering that universe. For nearest comparison purposes, the 20-year cumulative return of the MSCI US Large and Mid cap index&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.msci.com/our-solutions/indexes/index-resources/index-performance| title=Index Performance| publisher=MSCI}}&lt;/ref&gt; turned one dollar invested over that same period into $11.96, for an annualized return of 13.2%. Looking at Figure 3 of their paper (Wealth per dollar of initial investment), it can be seen that a 30-stock portfolio had just over a 50% chance of beating the index, a 50-stock portfolio over 55%, and a 100-stock portfolio about a 65% chance. These results presumably reflect the effect of a small-cap premium within the 1000-stock universe.

These results do not consider costs. If a cost advantage of 0.5%/year is expected from individual stocks over an index fund tracking the index, the ending value of one dollar in the index with an annualized return of 12.7% (= 13.2%-0.5%) becomes $10.94, at which point a 20-stock portfolio has a greater than 50% chance of beating the index fund. A 30-stock portfolio then has close to a 60% chance of coming out ahead, a 50-stock portfolio better than 65%, and a 100-stock portfolio has better than 75% chance of outperforming the index fund.

Of course, the magnitude of possible shortfalls should also be taken into consideration. Figure 3 shows how that magnitude grows with decreasing numbers of stocks.

===Summary===
In general, the answer to "how many stocks are recommended?" is, of course, as many as practically possible. Holding fewer stocks increases unsystematic risk and the effect of skewness on final portfolio value. Holding stocks in equal weights can pick up some small-cap premium, but remember that this also increases volatility. There is no free lunch.

As a rule, reducing the number of stocks held is always a negative when it comes to risk/reward ratio. Lower costs, from reduced expense ratios and increased tax savings, are the only guaranteed benefit. The trick is to figure out where the benefit balances out the increased risk. This is a personal decision.

==Portfolio construction==

===How to choose stocks?===
Some potentially useful factors to consider in choosing stocks are:
* Size (capitalization)
* Value (book-to-market ratio)
* Industry (at least early on)
* Liquidity (for smaller stocks)
* Dividend rate (for tax management purposes)

Size and value loadings and industry classification are of interest if you are trying to match or tilt away from market weights. Size and value are established [[Fama-French three-factor model analysis|Fama-French risk factors]], which some investors like to [[Value tilting - stock|tilt]] towards or away from. Dale Domian, David Louton and Marie Racine (see [[#Dale Domian, David Louton and Marie Racine|above]]) found that diversification across industries helped reduce dispersion of returns for small portfolio sizes, though it becomes less important for larger numbers of stocks held. Industry classification may also be of interest if you already have too much exposure to the risk of a certain industry through work, and want to reduce your portfolio's exposure to that industry. Low liquidity can be a problem in very small-cap stocks, leading to larger bid-ask spreads. Dividend yield may be of interest if you want to minimize your current taxable income.

Some other factors which have support in the academic literature are momentum, profitability, and low-beta. If you are interested in pursuing these tilts you may find individual stocks can do this, in the absence of easily-available index funds that incorporate those tilts.

If the Efficient Market Hypothesis holds, then reading balance sheets, shareholder reports and analyst recommendations is unnecessary and a complete waste of time. The strategy you use for deciding which exact stocks to hold should not matter -- you can neither help nor hurt yourself through choice of strategy. Random selection is a perfectly valid strategy, although it is not much trouble to select stocks from different industries so that you have a reasonable diversification across sectors and industries.

===Weighting===
The easiest way for you to buy stocks is in roughly equal weights -- for example, by buying equal-sized amounts of new stocks every month with new money. This will typically lead to a significant small-cap tilt in the portfolio if you choose stocks more or less at random. If you do not want exposure to the size factor, then David Ikenberry, Richard Shockley and Kent Womack found that weighting your stocks by relative market capitalization to yield median returns very close to the overall (capitalization-weighted) index (see [[#David Ikenberry, Richard Shockley and Kent Womack|above]]). As a practical matter, this leads to huge disparities in stock holding sizes for an individual investor, and is difficult to maintain as new money is added to the portfolio. An alternative is to buy equal dollar amounts of each stock, but weight the probability of buying a stock in proportion to its market capitalization; David Ikenberry, Richard Shockley and Kent Womack found that this generates results that are statistically indistinguishable from weighting individual holdings in proportion to market cap.

===Tracking error===
With smaller portfolios, you will experience "tracking error". This is the effect in which your returns in any one period differ from the entire market. While your long-term returns should be similar to the market, in any individual period you will see differences. The best example of this is when comparing US stock returns to international stock returns. Both may have the same long-term returns, but in any one year the returns will certainly differ.

If you compare international returns to a US benchmark index, you will see a difference each year and that would be tracking error. If you build a portfolio of US large cap stocks and compares the yearly results to the S&amp;P 500, you will see a difference each year. Over the long-term the cumulative results should be similar, but in any given year there will be a difference. Ronald Surz and Mitchell Price address tracking error and they indicate that random portfolios of 15 stocks should expect a tracking error of 8.1%, which reduces to 6.2% for a 30-stock portfolio and 5.3% for a 60 stock portfolio. They also indicate that by constructing the portfolio with a focus on balance among industries will reduce the tracking error to 5.4% (15 stocks), 4.2% (30 stocks) and 3.5% (60 stocks).

Tracking error is harmless to the disciplined long-term investor. Over time, you will generate the same cumulative returns as your benchmark index since your portfolio has the same risk characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.indexuniverse.com/publications/journalofindexes/joi-articles/12927-index-variation-and-overall-portfolio-performance.html| title=Looking at how different indexes affect performance| author=Craig Israelsen| publisher=JOI| date=October 2012| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190117214451/https://www.etf.com/publications/journalofindexes/joi-articles/12927-index-variation-and-overall-portfolio-performance.html| archive-date=January 17, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some investors may be alarmed to see tracking error, especially in years when their small portfolio underperforms the benchmark index.

===Transaction costs===
To minimize transaction costs (commissions and bid-ask spreads), it is best to avoid turnover as much as possible. For example, if you are considering [[tax loss harvesting]] then you should only do this if your tax benefit significantly outweighs your transaction costs.

One of the results that Dale Domian, David Louton and Marie Racine ([[#Dale Domian, David Louton and Marie Racine|above]]) found was that rebalanced portfolios have lower terminal wealth dispersions. However, besides incurring extra transaction costs, rebalancing systematically would create immediate taxable gains, so it is probably best avoided outside of a commission-free and tax-free situation. An exception might be if a single stock grows to become a significant fraction of the size of the portfolio all by itself; in this case, selling off some losing positions along with paring down the excess position can help minimize the tax impact.

==Tax management==
{{See also | Specific identification of shares}}

If you have individual stocks, you can cherry-pick the big winners and the big losers for tax management, while the index fund investor can only choose to buy, sell or donate the fund at today's [[net asset value]] (NAV) (which reflects the net of winners and losers). The individual stock investor will cherry-pick out the largest gainers and use those for more tax-efficient donations.

For example, if you plan to donate $2,000 to a charity, you can donate shares worth $2,000 (with a cost basis of $500) and pay no capital gains tax on that appreciation. The alternative is to sell the shares, realize a capital gain of $1,500 and pay $225 in income tax, leaving less money for charity or other purposes.

Another alternative is to gift highly appreciated shares to children. The child can often sell the shares and pay no capital gains tax, or pay tax at a lower rate than the parent. Donating or gifting the biggest gainers helps to [[Rebalancing|rebalance]] the portfolio, so that the largest holdings do not further impair diversification.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;US investors with charitable desires have a number of additional options for bequests outside of direct gifting. These can include establishing s [[Donor advised fund|donor advised fund]]
 for deferred gifting, or if an income from the contributed asset is still desired, from a [[Split-interest gifts|split-interest gift]], which could include the following:
* [[Charitable gift annuity]]
* [[Charitable pooled income fund]]
* [[Charitable remainder trust]] &lt;/ref&gt;

When death is imminent or foreseen, holding appreciated stocks may be useful, because appreciated assets qualify for a [[Step-up in basis| step-up in basis]] to market value, which greatly reduces, or even eliminates, the beneficiary's tax liability upon sale. 

If you hold taxable accounts, you may want to minimize the [[Dividend|dividend yield]] for tax efficiency, as realizing appreciation through capital gains is often more tax efficient than realizing the stock returns through dividends.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;For US passive investors in the lower tax brackets, like capital gains, annual streams of qualified dividends are taxed at zero percent. However, these dividends are still subject to state income tax. Capital gains can be deferred until the stock is sold.&lt;/ref&gt; An index investor must accept the dividend from the portfolio held by the index fund, while an individual stocks investor might prefer low-dividend or no-dividend stocks for their portfolio (as a general proposition, value stocks pay higher dividends than growth stocks).&lt;ref group="note"&gt; Vanguard value and growth index funds show the basic tendency of value stocks to provide higher dividends than growth stocks. See [[Principles of tax-efficient fund placement#Notes | Principles of tax-efficient fund placement]] for data. &lt;/ref&gt; A note of caution - it is not realistic to construct a portfolio with a 0.0% dividend yield, since there are not enough no-dividend companies in diverse industries and sectors to build a reasonably diversified portfolio. 

As noted above, the most powerful tax management tool is [[tax loss harvesting]], and if you hold individual stocks you can cherry-pick the losers from your portfolio and sell them for tax losses. You can use tax losses to offset capital gains, or (preferably) as a deduction against ordinary income of up to $3,000 per year. If your tax losses are greater than $3,000, you can carry over the remainder to be used in the following years. Unused carryover tax losses only expire after the death of the stockholder.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Capital losses and carry over losses (the $3,000 annual limit) must be deducted on a decedent's final tax return and remaining carryover losses cannot be carried over in the following years. See [http://www.irs.gov/publications/p544/ch04.html#en_US_publink100072659 Publication 544, Sales and Other Dispositions of Assets], IRS &lt;/ref&gt;

Controlling - meaning avoiding or minimizing - capital gains is also a tax management strategy. Tax losses are most valuable when you use them to reduce your ordinary income. These tax loss benefits typically accrue at higher tax rates, up to the maximum tax rate. When and if you generate any capital gains, these gains cancel out your banked tax losses, and this benefit is only at the capital gains rate (typically only 15%). 

You can minimize capital gains using several tactics. An index mutual fund must sell shares when the company is removed from the benchmark index, but an individual investor is not forced to sell for that reason. As a result, an individual stock investor can realize a lower turnover and lower capital gains. If you use charitable donations to help rebalance, this also serves to minimize realized capital gains. Using new money to help rebalance is another strategy to minimize realizing capital gains.

Although it is possible to manage realizing gains, it is probably not practical to assume the individual stock investor will never have capital gains, as companies are periodically taken over in cash transactions. In addition, it may be worth realizing capital gains if rebalancing is truly necessary and there are no other viable alternatives (such as using new money or charitable donations). 

After many years of tax management, you might end up with a portfolio with some shares that have little appreciation and some with greater appreciation. Those with little appreciation are perfect candidates to use in situations where you have a cash flow need, but want to avoid moving into a higher tax bracket. You can sell shares with little or no gain for cash flow without any impact on income taxes. In that sense, selling those stocks is identical to withdrawing funds from a Roth IRA.

==Record keeping==
The minimum records that you need to keep are the same as those for index funds: cost basis and date of each purchased lot, for eventual tax reporting purposes. For tax management purposes, it is also helpful to track your current unrealized gain or loss. The records your brokerage maintains may be enough.

If you want to track your performance against an index fund, it is straightforward to add an automatic lookup for the current price of that fund, and have the spreadsheet calculate how much a particular lot is worth as compared to what the same amount of money invested in the index fund would have been worth.

What is not so straightforward is accounting for dividends. If your dividend yield is similar to that of the fund, then comparing prices only may be sufficient. Otherwise, differences in dividend yield between the portfolio and the index fund will contribute to (apparent) tracking error. If this is a concern, you may need to manually account for dividends.

===US taxpayers abroad===
A US taxpayer abroad will need to keep this information in two different currencies. A convenient way to do this is to set up a spreadsheet with a line for each lot, with columns for purchase date and cost in the currency used for purchase, number of shares, exchange rate, and a calculated column for the purchase price in the other currency. Current prices and exchange rates can generally be automatically updated from the internet, and current gain or loss for each position automatically calculated in both currencies.

A little knowledge of spreadsheet programming is required, but once set up, the majority of the ongoing maintenance is just to add a new line whenever a new purchase is made. When a stock is sold or is delisted, the "current price" can be frozen to the sale or final price, and the line moved to a different area of the spreadsheet for historical tracking purposes. If a stock splits, you will need to update the number of shares.

The concept applies for savings towards any goal, such as retirement, purchasing a home, or saving for an education. The longer the timeframe, the larger the impact of the power of compounding.

If you start late, you can still catch up. However, you will need to invest more money, as compounding has much less time to have an effect.
{{blockquote|Compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world. He who understands it, earns it ... he who doesn't ... pays it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/76863-compound-interest-is-the-eighth-wonder-of-the-world-he |title=Quote by Albert Einstein: "Compound interest is ..."| accessdate=February 4, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;|Albert Einstein}}

==Compound interest==
{{See also|Wikipedia:Compound interest|l1=Compound interest - Wikipedia}}
Compound interest is interest added to the principal of a deposit or loan so that the ''added interest'' also earns interest from then on. This addition of interest to the principal is called ''compounding''. A bank account, for example, may have its interest compounded every year: in this case, an account with $1,000 initial principal and 5% interest per year would have a balance of $1,050 at the end of the first year, $1,102.50 at the end of the second year, $1,157.63 at the end of the third year, and so on.

==How much more will you get if you start early?==
If you invest $6,000 at the beginning of each year&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141128141326/http://vanguardblog.com:80/2011/12/12/need-proof/|archive-date=2014-11-28|title=Need proof? | publisher=Vanguard Blog|author=Charu Chander Gross|date=December 12, 2011|url=http://vanguardblog.com:80/2011/12/12/need-proof/|access-date=2023-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; (the equivalent of $500 per month, but placed at the beginning of the year for easier calculations), and start at age 55, assuming 4% annualized nominal return,&lt;ref group="note"&gt; The 114-year historical record of global stock and bond returns suggests that a globally balanced stock/bond portfolio will likely provide an annualized compound real return between 3% and 4%, assuming minimal expenses and no tax expense. See [https://blbarnitz4.wordpress.com/2015/02/12/global-investment-portfolios-2015-update/ Global investment portfolios 2015 update], from our site's unofficial (transferred) blog.&lt;/ref&gt; your balance at age 65 will be about $75,000. If you start at age 40, you will end up with about $260,000. And if you start at age 25 your balance at age 65 will be about $593,000.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Calculations are done as:&lt;br&gt;
Starting at age 25: 592,959.22 = FV(4%, 65-25, -6000,0,1)&lt;br&gt;
The last parameter of FV has Type set to 1, which represents a payment due at the beginning of the period.&lt;/ref&gt; The graph below illustrates this.

[[File:Saving-early-graph6.jpg|600px|border]]

To better understand what is going on, we can separate the amount invested in total from the growth of the invested money at 4% interest. Refer to the figure below.

Going from right to left, the lower (gray) bars represent your contributions. The sooner you start to invest, the more money you will have at retirement.

Now, look at the top (black) bars. Going from right to left, the sooner you start to invest, compounded interest has more time to work. Stated another way, the effect of compounding at age 20 will contribute much more significantly to your savings than contributions made later on.

[[File:Saving-early-graph2.jpg|600px|border]]

==What does it take to catch up if you start late?==
Suppose you want $100,000 at age 65, and the interest rate is again 4%. If you start at age 25, you will need to save only about $1,000 a year. At age 40, you will need to save about $2,300 a year. And if you start at age 55, the amount needed is over $8,000 per year.

[[File:Saving-early-graph4.jpg|500px|border]]

The total amount needed to reach $100,000 at age 65 also increases as the saving period gets shorter:

      <text bytes="9702" sha1="toga18y1rl6dejuwuuginc7xh3okoxm" xml:space="preserve">'''{{PAGENAME}}''' has some specific challenges. The objective (what the money is for) and its time horizon (when you will need it) affect which securities to use.

Your [[investment policy statement]] should document your medium-term goals (like a new car, a home purchase, starting a business, and education expenses for children) next to the long-term goals like retirement. You need to understand your [[Asset_allocation#Ability.2C_willingness.2C_and_need| need, willingness and ability]] to take investment risk related to each specific goal, and choose appropriate securities. Many investors use the term "saving" instead of "investing" for anything which is not long-term investing. 

Often, investors divide their investments into buckets according to the goals and timelines, and manage each with a specific strategy. Goals with a shorter timeline need safer investing, which will restrict investments to short-term instruments such as (high yield) savings accounts, bank CDs, money market funds, and short-term treasury securities that mature by the time the funds are needed. Longer term goals can include asset classes that fluctuate in price.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.finra.org/investors/set-time-frame-your-financial-goals| title=Set a Time Frame for Your Financial Goals| publisher=FINRA| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190118081745/http://www.finra.org/investors/set-time-frame-your-financial-goals| archive-date=January 18, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==

Suppose you want to invest money for goals with a medium-term timeline in a vehicle with better return than cash, to give this money a chance to grow without taking too much risk. 

Goals with a medium-term timeline are very diverse:
* Saving for regular or anticipated purchases that you cannot easily fund from cash flow, such as expenses for household appliances, a new car, marriage, or children. 
* Medium-term investing for specific projects that are some years away. For example, a down payment for a house or setting up a small business.
* Saving for education. This is very specific; for more, see: [[:Category: Education savings| Education savings]].
* Saving for unanticipated needs for cash, such as medical bills or job loss, uses an [[emergency fund]]. The goal of the emergency fund is to give you some liquidity to cover unexpected expenses or unemployment.

When setting your [[asset allocation]] (AA) and asset location for medium-term investing, the generic guidance of the [[Bogleheads® investing start-up kit|Bogleheads investing start-up kit]] and the [[Bogleheads® investment philosophy|Bogleheads investment philosophy]] certainly applies if you correctly take the [[Asset_allocation#Ability.2C_willingness.2C_and_need| need, willingness and ability]] to take risk into account. The specific characteristics of a security will determine its suitability for a given goal.

== Elements to take into account when determining how to invest for medium-term ==

The characteristics of the project for which you are saving constrains your investment choices. What is the [[Asset_allocation#Ability.2C_willingness.2C_and_need| need, willingness and ability]] to take risk on these medium-term timeline?
* Is capital preservation crucial? Or can you risk capital to strive for higher return?
* What flexibility do you need? How firm is your project's timetable? Might you need to start the project earlier than initially planned? Can you delay it if the investment does not cover it at the target date, because of lower return or loss of value? Can you put the project off until the investment recovers? 
* What is the savings rate? Could you make up the shortfall before the target date if the value of the investment fails to perform as expected?
* What is your general approach to investing? What is your current asset allocation? 
* What particular tax considerations might you have that woul also limit (or extend) your investment choices?

== Saving/investing asset allocation options ==
Some asset classes are particularly suitable for the medium-term timeline. You need to control the duration of the investments to match the due dates of your projects, and ensure the quality is very high to avoid loss of principal. 

* '''Cash like''': Very liquid and super easy to access, guarantee on the capital (if federally insured), lower return. Examples include a checking account, money market fund, and (High Yield) (insured) savings account.
* '''Reward checking account''' (RCA): Somewhat higher return, if you are willing to put in the effort to set up and maintain to get the higher APR. 
* '''Fixed income instruments''':
** [[CD]]s and similar: Can be federally insured, will have early withdrawal penalty (EWP) if not kept to term. Buy multiple sizes to avoid breaking the full CD and paying EWP on them.
** [[EE savings bonds|US savings bonds]]: These have a one-year lockout, and an annual purchase limit.
** Short term [[United States Treasury security]] 
** Tax-Exempt [[municipal bonds]] Funds 
** [[I savings bonds]] 
* '''Funds and ETFs''': For longer timelines you can use safe (quality short-term) bond funds or ETFs, or even safe equity funds or ETFs if you can bear the risk.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;In {{forum link| p=2686420| title=Buying a house in 2-4 years; what do I do with my mutual funds}}, 
White Coat Investor commented on the transfer from an existing investment in equity to a safer option for a house down payment:
{{blockquote|
The main thing is to consider your options in the event of a huge bear market. If the market drops 50%, what will you do? Here are some choices:

# Don't buy the house and just keep renting until the stocks recover and future savings gets you back to where you want to be.
# Maybe houses will be cheaper in an economic downturn and you can still buy it with your decreased amount.
# Maybe houses will be cheaper and you can use a mortgage with &lt; 20% down, leaving your investments intact.
# Maybe you won't buy a house at all.

For some people, for whom these options aren't good choices, should sell their stocks now and put the money in CDs. But there are many people for whom these other options are very realistic alternatives. For them, keeping some or all of the money in stocks is probably okay. The expected return is higher, even if the actual return may not be.}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Looking at the timeline, it is best to convert as the due date nears, from equity to bonds, to safe fixed income instruments, and finally to cash. It may be a good idea to do this gradually.

You can also use the ideas mentioned in the [[Emergency fund#Multi-tiered emergency fund|multi-tiered emergency fund]] for medium-term investing.

== Using taxable or tax advantaged accounts ==
==== General practice: use taxable accounts ====
It is best to save for short and medium term goals in a taxable account (checking, savings, CDs, and so on). Taxable accounts do not have an annual contribution limits, and they are refillable. You can readily take out and replace money.

It is not a good idea to save for known short or medium term needs or goals in a tax-advantaged account. These accounts have annual contribution limits. While you might be able to withdraw money under special considerations,&lt;ref group="note" name="contrib"&gt;You can withdraw Roth contributions at any time, free of taxes and penalties. This is not true of gains. See: [[Roth IRA]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note" name="earning"&gt;Earnings of contributions withdrawn before the due date of that year will be taxed. See IRS Publication 590-B: [http://www.irs.gov/publications/p590b/ch02.html#en_US_2014_publink1000231057 Are Distributions Taxable?].&lt;/ref&gt; they are not refillable. That is, you cannot put the money back after an early withdrawal.

==== When to use tax advantaged account ====
{{See also|Placing cash needs in a tax-advantaged account}}
It might be advantageous and possible to use ''non-used'' tax-advantaged space with extra contributions that have a medium-term timeline. This takes advantage of valuable Roth IRA contribution space that could be lost forever if you do not contribute. Compound interest requires time and money to work. Tax-advantaged space is better than taxable space. More tax-advantaged space is better than less, so use all you can every year. The advantages are more likely if the mid-term goal is not certain. At the time of the purchase you could withdraw the extra contributions&lt;ref group="note" name="contrib" /&gt; but not the earnings&lt;ref group="note" name="earning" /&gt; from the account. (See also the description in the wiki page on [[Emergency fund#Roth IRA as an emergency fund | Roth IRA as an emergency fund]]). 

If you have a sizable taxable account, you might be able to put a cash needs requirement, such as a home down payment, in a tax-advantaged account, and so improve the overall tax efficiency of your investment portfolio.

      <text bytes="19711" sha1="bv7ulfggikhs0qsjir8oq35qkapum61" xml:space="preserve">A '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an online application that provides automated investment advice.

Most robo-advisers collect information about your [[Investment policy statement|financial goals]], investment horizon, income and other assets, and your [[risk tolerance]], by asking you to complete an online questionnaire. Based on your answers, it creates and manages an investment portfolio for you.

Robo-advisers usually aim to offer investment advice at a lower cost than traditional advisers, and in some cases require lower account minimums than traditional [[Investment adviser|investment advisers]]. There is a lot of variation in the services that robo-advisers provide, and their approaches to investing.&lt;ref name="SEC"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.sec.gov/oiea/investor-alerts-bulletins/ib_robo-advisers.html| title=Investor Bulletin: Robo-Advisers| publisher=SEC.gov| date=February 23, 2017| accessdate=August 30, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal interaction==
The amount of human interaction available to you varies from one robo-adviser to another. Some robo-advisers may let you contact an investment professional to discuss your investment needs (this hybrid of both automated and personal advice is sometimes referred to as "bionic" advice). Other robo-advisers might only offer technical support, which will limit you to relying on the information on their websites or other sources you find to answer your questions about investing.&lt;ref name="SEC" /&gt;

As with any adviser, it is very important you take the time to learn about the robo-adviser’s services, including the level of interaction with a person, and find out answers to any questions you may have. Here are a few questions to consider:
* '''Human interaction:''' How much human interaction is important to you?
** Would you like to be able to ask a person questions about your investments, the investment strategy being used, and potential risks?
** Would you like to be able to speak with a person during market events, such as periods of exceptional volatility or downturns?
** Do you prefer being able to talk in person or on a phone, or is electronic communication okay?
* '''[[Bogleheads® financial literacy project| Financial literacy]]:''' What is your level of financial literacy, especially when it comes to investing? Your ability to ask a person questions about investing (for example, about the robo-adviser’s investment strategy) may be limited and you may need to rely almost entirely on the robo-adviser’s online disclosures or other sources of information that you find on your own.
** Are you comfortable using online resources?
* '''Follow-up:''' As with a traditional adviser, you may be interested in how often you will have contact with the robo-adviser. For example, how often does the robo-adviser follow-up with clients to confirm any changes that would affect their investment choices?
** Would you have to contact the robo-adviser with any updates to your financial situation? 

==Creating a recommendation==
A robo-adviser uses information you provide to create a recommendation. As a result, a robo-adviser’s recommendation is limited by the information it requests and receives from you, typically through an online questionnaire. It is important to keep in mind that some robo-advisers may obtain and consider only limited information about you. In addition, as with traditional advisers, in many cases it will be up to you to update this information. Here are a few questions to consider:

* '''Financial goals:''' Would you use the robo-adviser for a specific financial goal (for example, retirement, buying a home, or investing for your children’s education), or to meet your overall financial needs more broadly?
** Does the robo-adviser’s recommendation take into account your purpose in using the robo-adviser?
* '''Financial situation:''' Does the robo-adviser’s recommendation take into account relevant personal financial information, given your goal?
** For example, does the robo-adviser ask for information about high interest credit card debt or student loans you may have?
** Does it take into account your bank and savings accounts?
** Does it take into account your real estate holdings, such as your home, or other investments such as retirement accounts?
** Does it take into account other assets that you have?
* '''Risk tolerance:''' How does the robo-adviser take into account your tolerance for risk? How you respond to the robo-adviser’s questions about risk can affect what portfolio the robo-adviser recommends.
**In addition to the initial makeup of your portfolio, how does your risk tolerance impact how the robo-adviser might rebalance your portfolio (for example, in the event of a market decline)?

==Investing approach==
Different robo-advisers have different approaches to investing, including different investment styles and different products offered. Some have several pre-determined portfolios of investments that they will recommend for you that you may or may not be able to customize. Some robo-advisers focus solely on a limited range of investment products, such as broad-based [[Exchange-traded fund|exchange-traded funds]], or ETFs.&lt;ref name="SEC" /&gt;

Take the time to understand how the robo-adviser develops a portfolio recommendation, and what pieces of information it uses &amp;ndash; or does not use &amp;ndash; to develop a portfolio. Here are a few questions to consider:

* '''Investment products:''' Does the robo-adviser offer a limited range of investment products, such as only ETFs?
** Are the investment products used by the robo-adviser appropriate for your goals?
* '''Portfolio limitations:''' Does the robo-adviser only offer certain limited portfolios within those investment products?
** How many different portfolios could your money possibly be invested in?
** What portfolio does the robo-adviser recommend for you and why?
* '''Account types:''' What type of accounts does the robo-adviser manage? For example, does the robo-adviser manage [[Traditional IRA|individual retirement accounts (IRAs)]]? Taxable accounts? [[401(k)|401(k) accounts]] or [[529 plan|college savings plans]]?
* '''[[Tax loss harvesting]]:''' Does the robo-adviser use tax loss harvesting? Tax loss harvesting means selling investments that have experienced losses in your account, and this may have tax implications. The value of tax loss harvesting can depend on your particular tax situation in a given year. You also have to watch out for [[Wash sale|wash sale]] rules. Make sure you understand the tax implications of any sales, and consider whether you may wish to consult a tax adviser.&lt;ref name="SEC" /&gt; Tax loss harvesting does not apply to tax-deferred accounts, such as an IRA.

==Fees and other costs==
[[Mutual funds: additional costs|Fees and other costs]] can greatly impact your return on investment. One of the main benefits of a robo-adviser is usually lower fees and costs – so it is very important that you understand what you would be charged. A robo-adviser may offer lower-cost investment advice, but if the robo-adviser uses investment products with high costs, your total overall costs could still be high. It is important to understand your total costs.

An adviser's SEC filing will show their fees (see [[#Licensing and registration|below]]).

==Licensing and registration==
Firms that provide advisory services in the U.S. are typically registered as investment advisers with either the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) or one or more state securities authorities. Although the services that they provide are automated, robo-advisers in the U.S. must comply with the securities laws applicable to SEC or state-registered investment advisers. Use the SEC’s [https://adviserinfo.sec.gov/ Investment Adviser Public Disclosure] (IAPD) database to research the background, including registration or license status and disciplinary history, of any individual or firm recommending an investment.

Like traditional investment advisers, robo-advisers are also required to file a Form ADV.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Investment advisers file Form ADV to register with the SEC and/or the states. Some advisers that are exempt from registration (Exempt Reporting Advisers) also complete a portion of the questions in Form ADV for reporting to the SEC and/or the states. All investment advisers must periodically update the information in their filings. Form ADV contains information about an investment adviser and its business operations. Form ADV also contains disclosure about certain disciplinary events involving the adviser and its key personnel. Source: [https://adviserinfo.sec.gov/ Investment Adviser Public Disclosure], from the SEC.&lt;/ref&gt; Robo-advisers may also offer certain information about their advisory business on their websites or in communications with clients. Check the robo-adviser’s website regularly to see if there is any updated information.

==Risks and limitations==
While automated investment tools may offer clear benefits &amp;ndash; including low cost, ease of use, and broad access &amp;ndash; it is important to understand their risks and limitations before using them. Investors should be wary of tools that promise better portfolio performance.&lt;ref name = "ToolTips"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.sec.gov/investment/investor-alerts-and-bulletins/autolistingtools| title=Investor Alert: Automated Investment Tools| publisher=SEC| date=May 8, 2015| accessdate=August 30, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Understand any terms and conditions.''' Review all relevant disclosures for an automated investment tool.
**Understand any terms and conditions, such as the fees and expenses associated with using the tool or with selling or purchasing investments.
**Find out how you can terminate any agreement or relationship, and how long it may take to cash out any investments if you decide to stop using the tool. If anything is unclear or you need additional information, directly contact the automated tool sponsor.
**Ask an automated investment tool sponsor whether it receives any form of compensation for offering, recommending, or selling certain services or investments. 
*'''Consider the tool’s limitations, including any key assumptions.''' Be aware that an automated tool may rely on assumptions that could be incorrect or do not apply to your individual situation. For example, an automated investment tool may be programmed to use economic assumptions that will not react to shifts in the market. If the automated tool assumes that interest rates will remain low but, instead, interest rates rise, the tool’s output will be flawed.
**In addition, an automated investment tool, like other investment programs, may be programmed to consider limited options. For example, an automated investment tool may only consider investments offered by an affiliated firm.
*'''The tool’s output directly depends on what information it seeks from you and what information you provide.''' Which questions the tool asks and how they are framed may limit or influence the information you provide, which in turn directly impacts the output that an automated investment tool generates.
** If any of the questions are unclear or you do not understand why the information is being sought, ask the tool sponsor.
** Be aware that a tool may ask questions that are over-generalized, ambiguous, misleading, or designed to fit you into the tool’s predetermined options. 
** In addition, be very careful when inputting your answers or information. If you make a mistake, the resulting output may not be right for you.
*'''The tool’s output may not be right for your financial needs or goals.''' An automated investment tool may not assess all of your particular circumstances, such as your age, financial situation and needs, investment experience, other holdings, tax situation, willingness to risk losing your investment money for potentially higher investment returns, time horizon for investing, need for cash, and investment goals. Consequently, some tools may suggest investments (including [[asset allocation]] models) that may not be right for you. 
** For example, an automated investment tool may estimate a time horizon for your investments based only on your age, but not take into account that you need some of your investment money back in a few years to buy a new home. In addition, automated tools typically do not take into account that your financial goals may change. 
** If the automated investment tool does not allow you to interact with an actual person, consider that you may lose the value that human judgment and oversight, or more personalized service, may add to the process. 
* '''Safeguard your personal information.''' Be aware that an automated tool sponsor may be collecting your personal information for purposes unrelated to the tool. Understand when and with whom your personal information may be shared. If you have questions that are not answered in the tool’s privacy policy, contact the tool’s sponsor for more information.

==Robo-adviser reviews==

==Portfolio performance==
A portfolio's performance (return over time) depends on your asset allocation, which is a balance of your [[Asset allocation#Ability, willingness, and need | ability, willingness, and need]] to take risk. The selection process is no different with a robo-adviser portfolio than one based on a "conventional" portfolio from, for example, [[Fidelity]], [[Charles Schwab|Schwab]], or [[Vanguard]].

Robo-adviser portfolios typically hold more funds than a [[Lazy portfolios|lazy portfolio]], but that does not guarantee a better return. There is a comprehensive discussion in this {{Forum post|t=224764|title=Backtesting some robo-advisers asset allocations}}.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;If you are uncomfortable using a robo-adviser, but still wish to manage your own investments, consider a [[Target date funds|target date fund]] instead. These "Set and forget" type funds have been performing "automated" investment management for quite some time - well before the advent of robo-advisers.

      <text bytes="16083" sha1="g09k5fp2c55pvtk8q2cduvsfnmkz5dj" xml:space="preserve">'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a free and open-source personal and small-business financial accounting software. GnuCash allows you to track bank accounts, stocks, income and expenses. It uses double-entry accounting to ensure balanced books and accurate reports.&lt;ref name=official&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gnucash.org/|title=GnuCash offical website|accessdate=December 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; GnuCash's data file format is fully open and stores data in either an XML file (the default) or an SQL database.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wiki.gnucash.org/wiki/FAQ#Q:_Where_is_my_GnuCash_data_file.3F|title=FAQ - GnuCash|accessdate=2017-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GnuCash has versions that run on Windows, macOS, and many different flavors of Linux and BSD.&lt;ref name="GNU"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://wiki.gnucash.org/wiki/GnuCash| title=GnuCash Wiki| accessdate=December 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Programming on GnuCash began in 1997, and its first stable release was in 1998. Small Business Accounting was added in 2001. A Mac installer became available in 2004. A Windows port was released in 2007.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gnucash.org/oldnews.phtml |publisher=gnucash.org |title=GnuCash - Older Announcements|accessdate=December 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; An Apple Silicon version was made available on July 16, 2024.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lists.gnucash.org/pipermail/gnucash-devel/2024-July/046942.html |publisher=gnucash.org |title=Announcement: GnuCash 5.8 For Apple Silicon |accessdate=July 23, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2012, the development of GnuCash for Android was announced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.codinguser.com/2012/05/gnucash-mobile/| title=Gnucash Mobile| date=May 10, 2012| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120516071603/http://www.codinguser.com/2012/05/gnucash-mobile/| archive-date=May 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is an expense-tracking companion app for GnuCash, as opposed to a stand-alone accounting package.

== Main features ==
GnuCash's main features include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gnucash.org/features.phtml|title=GnuCash Features|accessdate=December 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Double entry accounting. Every transaction must debit one account and credit others by an equal amount. This ensures the books balance, so that the difference between income and expenses exactly equals the sum of assets and liabilities.
* A checkbook-style register, including split transactions, autofill and the ability to mark a transaction cleared or reconciled.
* Scheduled transactions.
* Reports and graphs. An integrated module to display graphs of your financial data as barcharts, pie charts,  and scatter plots. GnuCash also comes complete with a full suite of standard and customizeable reports, including a balance sheet, profit and loss statement, and portfolio valuation.
* Statement reconciliation. This lets you compare the transactions entered in an account against a bank statement.
* [[Stock]], [[bond]], and [[mutual fund]] accounts.
* Small-business accounting.
* Quicken Interchange Format (QIF) and Open Financial Exchange (OFX) import. If you are migrating from other financial software, GnuCash can import Intuit® Quicken® QIF files using a practical assistant.

==Quicken to GnuCash conversion==
{{Cleanup section|small=no|reason=Does not conform to wiki standards (reference [[w:Wikipedia:Manual of Style|Wikipedia:Manual of Style]]).}}
[https://www.quicken.com/ Quicken] is a commercial personal finance management program. This section describes how Quicken owners can import their existing data into GnuCash.

The following are steps recorded while converting an existing Quicken 2016 file (with a 20-year history) into GnuCash so that the account hierarchy and account history transfers from Quicken to GnuCash. These steps may not apply to everyone (they depend on how you used Quicken in the past). If you find any information that is inaccurate, or if you have new information, please post a suggestion in this {{Forum post | t=234157|title=Experiences with Quicken to GNUCash Conversion}}.

=== Before you start ===
Before you start, it might be good to learn about GnuCash and its accounting philosophy (double entry accounting). The [https://www.gnucash.org/viewdoc.phtml?doc=guide GnuCash Tutorial and Concepts Guide] is a great resource to start.
* The key concept to digest is the fact that &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; is an account in GnuCash, and &lt;em&gt;every transaction&lt;/em&gt; is a transfer from one account to another. For example, if you spend $100 on clothes, it is recorded as a transfer from your credit card account to the Expenses/Clothing account. Similarly, a paycheck is a transfer from your "Income/salary" account to other accounts specified on your paycheck.

=== Preparations for conversion ===
On the Quicken end, save a copy of your QDF file ("Save a copy as ..." option) and use that copy as the source for your conversion. Make sure to not run any updates (including Quote Updates) on that QDF copy. This is a good way to ensure that you do not accidentally update your QDF source file during the whole conversion process. If you update the QDF file before completing the conversion, you will have no way to check if the account balances and transactions match between Quicken and GnuCash.

As of November 2017, the GnuCash QIF importer does not handle the following cases correctly, and must be fixed in Quicken first:
* If the input QIF file has stock option transactions such as vest, expire, exercise, and so on, the QIF importer errors out with an exception. The workaround would be to modify the account in question to remove these transactions and convert them to "regular" stock transactions like sold or bought. This may look a bit strange, because you are buying stock out of thin air (your cash balance will be negative after the bought transaction), but in the end it works out (the cash balance becomes positive after the stock is sold off at a profit). 

GnuCash can import Quicken data using the QIF format. To ensure that you have &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; (including categories and payees) in your Quicken account exported, use the "File-&gt;File Export-&gt;QIF File ..." menu in Quicken and check that:
* Everything is checked under "Include in Export" box.
* "All Accounts" is selected in the "Quicken Account to Export From" box.
* The date range covers your entire history on Quicken.
An example is shown below:

[[File:quicken-qif-export.png]]

You can use the saved QIF file for GnuCash import.

=== Conversion ===
The following are steps that worked for me. The conversion wizard may take a different path depending on your individual situation and account types -- use your best judgement on such cases:
* Open GnuCash, create a new file ("File -&gt; New File"), and cancel the "New Account Hierarchy Setup" wizard.
* Select "File -&gt; Import -&gt; Import QIF" and click "Forward" on the wizard.
* In the next screen, select the QIF file that was exported from Quicken and click "Forward".
* Click "Start". The converter would start parsing transactions from the QIF file. Keep monitoring the text box beneath for any warnings. No warnings means your input file is good. Otherwise, you might need to adjust the source Quicken data file in such a way to make the warnings go away (one example was the stock option exercise or vest transactions that was pointed out in the previous section). Click "Forward" once the processing is complete.
* In the next two screens, Quicken will show account names for each individual account &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; category in the incoming Quicken file. Check if everything is OK and click "Forward".
** GnuCash will also call out uncategorized transactions and will request you to find the matching GnuCash account names (that is, "categories" in Quicken). Fix as needed.
* Select "USD" for currency and click "Forward".
* In the next few screens, GnuCash will ask you to enter information about all tradeable securities it found in the Quicken file. Just make sure that the name, ticker symbol and exchange (NYSE, NASDAQ, FUND ...) are correct and fix if incorrect. This will be useful once we start auto-updating quotes.
** Note: This may take a while depending on how many securities there are in your Quicken account.
* In the final dialog that comes up after all securities are entered, you can either choose to leave everything at default, or go over the options and change anything as needed.
* Finally, you will see a "QIF Import" dialog with a "Start Import" button. Click to start importing.
** This is the core part of the conversion process, where GnuCash will create new accounts and try to match transactions across accounts. This may take a while depending on the length of your Quicken history.
* Click "Apply" once the process is done. This will conclude the import Wizard.
The account balances and net worth shown by GnuCash is unlikely to be correct (that is, it probably will not match Quicken balances and net-worth). Go over the post conversion notes to fix issues with the import.

==== Troubleshooting ====
In any step above, if the QIF importer abruptly fails or crashes, one option to proceed would be to enable tracing and running GnuCash in "debug" mode; this generates a lot of helpful logging information. See [https://wiki.gnucash.org/wiki/Tracefile Tracefile - GnuCash] for more information about trace file logging and locations.

=== Post-conversion notes ===
As of November 2017, because of unresolved issues with the QIF importer, you may need the following post-conversion actions (these are what I found, but there may be more depending on how complex or long your Quicken history is).
* If the input QIF file has stock option transactions such as vest, expire, exercise, and so on, the QIF importer errors out with an exception. The workaround would be to modify the account in question to remove these transactions and convert them to "regular" stock transactions like sold or bought. This may look a bit strange, because you are buying stock out of thin air (your cash balance will be negative after the bought transaction), but in the end it works out (the cash balance becomes positive after the stock is sold off at a profit). 
* The QIF importer does not handle "Empty-ish" paychecks correctly. These are paychecks where the entire incoming salary is transferred out to other accounts (via paycheck deductions), so that there is no balance left to deposit into the primary checking account which has the paycheck transactions recorded. For such paychecks, the QIF importer completely reverses the direction of all the split transactions in the paycheck. These need to be fixed post import.
** These errors are actually easy to detect. We just need to look at the "Salary" ledger and review any items in the "Charge" column. Ideally, all the items in the "Salary" account's ledger must be in the "Income" column. Identify any transactions in the "Charge" column and fix them on a case-by-case basis.
* Load accounts are incorrectly initialized. Ideally, the House "Asset" account must have the transfers from the bank (for down payment), and from the Mortgage Loan account (for the loan amount). At the end of import, in the "Loan" accounts ledger the loan's initial balance is categorized as "Retained Earnings" which does not make any sense at all. Fix the initialization to match the ideal expectation of initializing a house purchase and mortgage loan.
* At the end of import, the prices of all imported securities will be $0. This will cause a big difference between the Quicken and the GnuCash balance. Go to each security, find the corresponding price in Quicken and do a manual update of the price in GnuCash. 
* At this point, all account balances between Quicken and GnuCash would match unless there is another problem that isn't covered by the above.
* One more weird thing I noticed that needed fixing was the fact that all "investor" -&gt; "admiral" share conversions were handled by transfers into "Equity::Retained Earnings" account. Following the GnuCash convention, the "Equity::Retained Earnings" account is used to record account opening balances (that is, balances that existed before starting GnuCash accounting and had no history). The "sale" of the investor shares were recorded as direct share transfer (without a price) while the "purchase" of the admiral shares were recorded as "buy" transactions (with an associated price) with the Equity::Retained Earnings account as the source of funds. This caused an imbalance in the final Equity::Retained Earnings balance.
** There are multiple ways to fix this. For simplicity, since I do not care about the cost basis of these shares (they are in retirement accounts), I simply deleted the existing transactions that recorded the conversion and used a single "sell" transaction in the investor share account and a single "buy" transaction in the admiral share account (the prices should be available in the transaction history provided by the custodian). Once I was done with this, the "Equity::Retained Earnings" account had a very small final balance that only reflected the account opening balances for accounts that were open prior to starting any kind of Quicken/MS Money/GnuCash accounting.

=== Account organization ===
Once import is complete, it may be worth spending some time to organize accounts into an account hierarchy. First, decide on what account hierarchy makes sense in your case. The following is one example:
{| class="wikitable"
|
* Assets
** Real Estate
*** House
** Investments
*** Retirement
*** Taxable
*** 529
* Banking
** Checking
*** Bank of America
** Savings
*** Ally Bank
* Credit Cards
** American Express
* Equity (GnuCash creates this automatically).
* Expenses
** Bills
** Dining Out
** ...
* Income
** Salary
** Dividends
** Capital Gains
* Loans
** Mortgage
|}
Then, start creating accounts at each level matching the hierarchy (note: &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; is an account is GnuCash). Once you have created the top-level accounts, right-click on the top-level account, select "New Account ...", fill in the details for the account and save it. You can also move existing accounts imported from Quicken, by right-clicking on them, selecting "Edit Account" and then choosing an appropriate parent account in the account hierarchy. You can modify the account hierarchy any number of times without any side-effects.

One more thing to ensure when organizing accounts would be to make sure all accounts are of correct type (refer to the GnuCash tutorial for types and descriptions).

==Quickbooks to GnuCash conversion==
A guide on converting from quickbooks to GNUCash is available at Github: [https://github.com/erikmack/qb-escape QuickBooks -&gt; GnuCash migration scripts from LWN].

One Boglehead forum user's experience is that the sample.QIF file provided did not work and created only a lock file and no output, but it does work on exports from Quickbooks 2021 Desktop for Windows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://github.com/erikmack/qb-escape/issues/5| title=Scripts not working with Python 3.11.9 on MacOS 14.5| publisher=GitHub| accessdate=July 26, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text bytes="5056" sha1="c8d74y47l1rnccxpvpofpii3tb95h69" xml:space="preserve">'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a method to value the asset. It is similar to moving average method. The moving average method takes the arithmetic average 5 days of market value. The result 'moves' depending on the valuation date. Linear smoothing instead recognizes the gains and loss due to investment return over time. Over 4 years, it would recognize 25% from last year, 50% from two years prior, 75% from three years prior and 100% from 4 years prior. The purpose of the method is two folds. It reduces overreliance on current market value and it reduces the volatility of the resulting valuation. 
==Calculation==
The linear smoothing as approved by ERISA (automatic Approval 15 &lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |url=http://www.soa.org/library/newsletters/pension-forum/2002/september/pfn0209.pdf |title=Asset Valuation Methods under ERISA |date= September 2002 |website= |publisher= Society of Actuaries, Pension forum, volume 14, number 1|access-date= |last= Paulette Tino and Edward Sypher|first= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;) adjusts for a single year of expected returns. The example below use 7% expected returns and contributions at mid-year using compounded interest. The gains and loss at 12/31 for Year 1 is (-8,480) = 196,500 – 204,980. Of this, 75% is recognized and 25 % is unrecognized (-2,120) = (-8,480) * 25%. The linear smoothed value is the Market value at Year 4 less the sum of past unrecognized gains and loss 287,704 = 228,000 – (-2,120 + -5,781 + -51,803).

==Desirable characteristics==
There are many types of method to value asset each with their own merits and faults. For example, current market value, book value or moving average. The desirable characteristics of an asset valuation method should be&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cia-ica.ca/docs/default-source/2014/214100e.pdf |title=Guidance on Asset Valuation Methods |date=September 2014  |website= |publisher=Canadian Institute of Actuaries |access-date= |last= |first= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Achieves objectives
* Tracks to market value
* Does not unduly deviate from market value
* Has a reasonable and logical relationship to market value
* Is generally free of any bias
* Has no undue influence on investment transaction decisions or vice versa
* Is consistent with the length of typical economic cycles

==Phase-in==
Making change in a valuation method is not to be taken lightly. It should only happen infrequently and with care. Instead of retroactively applying the method to year before the valuation method is change, we can apply a phase-in period. Say in the previous example year 2 was when the linear smoothing valuation method was selected. Year 2 market value as of 1/1 would be fully recognized. The linear smoothing with phase-in as of Year 2 would rather be 285,584 = 228,000 – (-8,480 * 0% + -11,563 * 50% + -69,071 * 25%).

==Corridor==
In order to keep a closer relationship to market value, corridor can be implemented. Any linear smoothed value above 120% of the current Market Value(MV) and under 80% would be capped at 80% * MV or 120% * MV. This corridor strategy will help achieve better tracking to market value and recognize faster major change in market valuation.

==Controversy==
The smoothing of asset is the subject of many articles against it&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |url=http://sfmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sfarchive/2003/08/Provocative-Pension-Accounting.pdf |title=Provocative Pension Accounting |date=August 2003  |website= Strategic Finance Magazine|publisher=Institute of Management Accountants |access-date= |last=Hope |first=Ole-Kristian |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://iveybusinessjournal.com/publication/pension-accounting-the-end-of-smoothing/ |title=Pension accounting the end of smoothing|date=April 2005  |website= Ivey Business Jouranl|publisher=Ivey Business School |access-date= |last=Wiedman|first=Christine |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The main concerns are : transparency issue, time lagging issue, manipulation issue. The method is less transparent than market value. It can confuse the unaware observer. Any gains and loss are recognize through time. This means that the 2008 crash is recognized between 2009 to 2014. During 2010-2014, it surprises the unaware observer that the value of asset diminish while investment were up during the last year.  Finally, actively changing the valuation method to best fit our objective as time past, brings an unwanted bias in our asset valuation.

'''Lazy portfolios''' are designed to perform well in most market conditions. Most contain a small number of low-cost funds that are easy to [[Rebalancing|rebalance]]. They are "lazy" in that the investor can maintain the same [[Asset allocation|asset allocation]] for an extended period of time, as they generally contain 30-40% [[Bond basics|bonds]], suitable for most pre-retirement investors.

==Canadian versions of lazy portfolios==
{{Main|finiki:Simple index portfolios}}
Below are a few examples of lazy portfolios (also called simple portfolios) that Canadian domiciled investors can use.

===Three ETFs===
The three-ETF portfolio is recommended for its simplicity and diversification.

Three-ETF portfolios consist of Canadian bonds, Canadian stocks and global stocks. Here is an example using TSX-traded ETFs from Vanguard Canada:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.financialwisdomforum.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=528931#p528931| title=Re: Simple Portfolios 2014}} Financial Wisdom Forum discussion.&lt;/ref&gt;

|}
Suitable alternatives from other vendors for two of the three ETFs in the table above are mentioned in the following pages: [[finiki:Conventional_bonds#Bond_indexes.2C_index_funds_and_ETFs|Canadian bonds]] and [[finiki:Common_shares#Mutual_funds_and_ETFs|Canadian equities]]. For global stocks, VXC currently has few competitors on the TSX. There are US-listed options for the global equity ETF, such as [{{Vf | 3141}} VT], but they include a small percentage (3-4%) of Canadian equities.

This three-fund portfolio may appear overly simplistic. Certainly the brokerage statements will look very boring. Yet this portfolio has the following characteristics:
* Exposure to over 500 Canadian bonds (terms of 1 to over 25 years; credit ratings covering the full investment grade spectrum, include government and corporate bonds)
* Exposure to nearly 250 Canadian stocks covering large-, mid- and small-capitalizations
* Exposure to thousands of large- and mid-capitalization stocks from other developed and emerging markets
* Will be very easy to rebalance 
* Weighted average management fee of 0.14% (December 2014), full MER will be a few basis points higher 
* No currency exchange fees for ETF transactions using Canadian dollars
* No currency hedging of global equities

Model portfolios maintained by [https://canadiancouchpotato.com/model-portfolios/ Canadian Couch Potato] use the same three ETFs as in the example above, with a range of fixed income from 10 to 70% of the portfolio. For equities, his Canadian:Global mix is 1:2 instead of 1:1.

===Four index funds===
If you do not want to open a brokerage account, a four index fund portfolio is available.

Simple index portfolios with four index funds include Canadian equities, US equities, EAFE Equities, and Canadian bonds. The following table is an example of a simple index portfolio built with [[finiki:Benchmarks#FPX_Indexes|"FPX Balanced"]] allocations, using four [https://www.tdcanadatrust.com/products-services/investing/mutual-funds/td-eseries-funds.jsp TD e-funds] as a example of low-cost index mutual funds:

Model portfolios maintained by [https://canadiancouchpotato.com/model-portfolios/ Canadian Couch Potato] use the same four index funds as in the example above, with a range of fixed income from 10 to 70% of the portfolio. For equities, his Canadian:US:International mix is 1:1:1. The model with 40% bonds is traditionally known as the '''Global Couch Potato''' portfolio from [https://www.moneysense.ca/ MoneySense]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Dale Roberts| publisher=MoneySense| url=https://www.moneysense.ca/save/investing/ultimate-couch-potato-portfolio-guide-overview/| title=New for 2022: The Ultimate Couch Potato Portfolio Guide| accessdate=August 19, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Dale Roberts| publisher=MoneySense| url=https://www.moneysense.ca/save/investing/couch-potato-guide-core-portfolios/| title=Core Couch Potato portfolios| accessdate=August 19, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Four ETFs===
Simple index portfolios with four ETFs include Canadian equities; US equities; EAFE Equities; and Canadian bonds. Sticking with a 50:50 mix of equities and fixed income, using the FPX Balanced index to allocate equities, and using BMO ETFs for illustration purposes, produces:

Investors who want a simple [[asset allocation]] portfolio often use a '''two-fund portfolio'''. This consists of one equity [[index fund]] and one fixed income fund. The fund selections can vary depending on asset class (global equity or domestic equity, and bond type), and asset type ([[Mutual fund|mutual fund]], [[exchange-traded fund]] (ETF), and [[Collective investment trust|collective investment trust]] (CIT)).

==Global two-fund portfolios==
[[Rick Ferri]] has proposed a [[Lazy portfolios#Two fund portfolio|two-fund portfolio]] consisting of the following asset classes:
* A global stock market index fund/ETF
* A US intermediate term bond index fund/ETF

He suggests a US total market bond index fund/ETF for the fixed income selection. However, you can substitute a global bond index fund/ETF, a US intermediate-term bond index fund/ETF, a US intermediate-term [[treasury bond]] index fund/ETF, or a US [[Municipal bonds|municipal bond]] index fund/ETF for the fixed income allocation. You may also find that employer-provided retirement plans will use collective investment trusts as investment vehicles.

You can adjust Rick Ferri's two-fund portfolio to reflect any stock/bond allocation. The charts below show suggestions for different asset allocations.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==US-only two-fund portfolios== 
Both [[John Bogle]] and Warren Buffett have recommended portfolios for investors who want to invest in US domestic stocks and bonds. 

===John Bogle's two-fund portfolio===
[[John Bogle]] has often suggested that an investor can use one total US stock market index fund and one total US bond index fund.{{#tag:ref|In chapter 18 of ''The Little Book Of Common Sense Investing'', [[John Bogle]] wrote:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=The Little Book of Common Sense Investing| chapter=Chapter 18 - What Should I Do Now?| author=John Bogle| author-link=John Bogle| date=2007| isbn=978-0-470-10210-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Blockquote|Deep down, I remain absolutely confident that the vast majority of American families will be well served by owning their equity holdings in an all-U.S. stock-market index portfolio and holding their bonds in an all-U.S. bond-market index portfolio.

You can allocate the portfolio in various stock/bond allocations, as shown in the charts below.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Warren Buffett's two-fund portfolio===
[[File:Buffett two-fund portfolio.png|150px|thumb|Warren Buffett's two-fund portfolio]]
Warren Buffett has suggested a two-fund portfolio consisting of a 90% allocation to an [[S&amp;P 500 index|S&amp;P 500]] index fund and a 10% allocation to [[treasury bills]].{{#tag:ref|In his 2013 letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders, Warren Buffett wrote:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/2013ltr.pdf| title=2013 Letter to the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc| author=Warren Buffett| date=February 28, 2014| accessdate=June 8, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Blockquote|What I advise here is essentially identical to certain instructions I’ve laid out in my will. One bequest provides that cash will be delivered to a trustee for my wife’s benefit. (I have to use cash for individual bequests, because all of my Berkshire shares will be fully distributed to certain philanthropic organizations over the ten years following the closing of my estate.) My advice to the trustee could not be more simple: Put 10% of the cash in short-term government bonds and 90% in a very low-cost S&amp;P 500 index fund. (I suggest Vanguard’s.) I believe the trust’s long-term results from this policy will be superior to those attained by most investors – whether pension funds, institutions or individuals – who employ high-fee managers.}}|group="note"}}

You can purchase treasury bills in a brokerage (or Treasury Direct) account, where investors tender a noncompetitive bid at auction. You can also use a treasury money market fund, or an ETF investing in 1 to 3 month bills for access to the treasury bill market. 

However, you are free to substitute an intermediate bond fund (total bond, intermediate bond, treasury bond, or municipal bond) for the t-bill allocation if desirable. Many employer-provided retirement plans offer S&amp;P 500 index funds or collective investment trusts.

You can also choose to allocate the Buffett two-fund portfolio to various stock/bond allocations.

==One balanced index fund portfolio==
You can also build a two-fund portfolio by investing in a single [[Balanced fund|balanced]] index fund. For example, [[Vanguard]], [[Fidelity]], and [[Schwab|Charles Schwab]] offer [[Target date retirement funds|target date retirement index funds]] that provide access to global stocks and intermediate bonds. Vanguard also offers global target risk balanced index funds (the [[LifeStrategy]] funds). Vanguard's funds provide access to both global stocks and global bonds. Fidelity and Schwab's target date offerings provide access to global stocks and US bonds.

Vanguard offers a US Balanced Index Fund, consisting of a 60/40 stock/bond allocation using a total US stock market index allocation and a total US bond market index allocation.

Because of [[Tax-efficient fund placement#Tax efficiency of balanced funds| tax implications]], it is often recommended that balanced index funds are used in tax-deferred and tax-free investment accounts.

      <text bytes="6449" sha1="95sfpkq1oa0kbra9qt35s9vy208wb0n" xml:space="preserve">'''{{PAGENAME}}''' compares a '''saving rate''' with Return on Investment (ROI), to understand its impact on your financial goals.

Investors often focus primarily on [[asset allocation]], expenses associated with investments (such as transaction fees and [[expense ratios]]), tax efficiency (types of account), sector allocation, active vs passive, and so on, to maximize their return on investment to reach a financial goal. The [[importance of saving early]] is also well documented.

Beyond these, though, achieving your financial goals relies on a combination of market returns and the amount you save over time (that is, your ''saving rate'').

==Saving rate==
Your saving rate is the percentage of your income that you save towards a financial goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/savings-rate.asp |title=Savings Rate: Definition, Influences, History in the U.S.| date=May 12, 2023 |publisher=Investopedia| accessdate=August 25, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To put the saving rate into perspective, suppose two investors Alice and Bob each have $100,000 in income, and each saves a percentage of their income consistently for 30 years.
* Alice saves 4% of her income ($4,000), and her return on investment on saving is 6%. After 30 years, she has $316,233.
* Bob saves 6% of his income ($6,000), but his return on investment on saving is only 4%. After 30 years, he has $336,510. His higher saving rate has more than overcome his lower return on investments.

Increasing your saving rate is particularly important when the return on investments is low. However if return on investments is very high, then the impact of saving rate becomes relatively less important. Alternately, if your saving rate is less than 4%, the saving rate you use has a huge impact on the end balance, when compared the rate of return.

Table 1 below helps to show the relationship between ''saving rate'' and ''return on investment'' for a given saving rate. For example, with a saving rate of 1%, you need a 12% return on investment to save $241,334. In contrast, for a saving rate of 2%, a return slightly over 8% is enough to achieve the same end balance of $241,334.

When starting out, your saving rate has the most impact on increasing your portfolio value.

In investing, we make personal choices about how much [[Risk and return: an introduction|risk]] we are willing to take if we think we can get higher return in exchange. '''{{PAGENAME}}''' compares historical performance of similar funds that are appropriate for [[short-term]] savings.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt; John Bogle, in his 1994 classic, ''Bogle on Mutual Funds'', suggested using a low-cost short-term treasury bond fund, with its government backed credit rating, as a prudent substitute for a money market fund for investment reserves distinct from savings and transaction account balances. (p.132 in the text)&lt;/ref&gt;

Volatility--fluctuations in value--are an important aspect of risk. In financial economics, volatility is often measured by a statistical value called the [[wikipedia:Standard deviation| standard deviation]], represented by the Greek letter ''sigma'' (σ). The standard deviation of mutual funds can be found on sites like [http://www.morningstar.com Morningstar] or [https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/fund-performance PortfolioVisualizer]. However, it is hard to relate this number to a practical question, like "how much risk would I be taking by putting money I need a year from now into a short-term bond fund instead of a money market fund?" This article tries to help with this kind of question.

==Overview==
In this article, we calculate some other measures of risk by calculating what would have happened to an investment of $10,000, held for short periods of time, in a [[mutual fund]] or [[exchange-traded fund]] (ETF). You might do this in hope of making more than you would have made in a money market mutual fund, and accepting the possibility of sometimes making less.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt; For funds and ETFs, calculations are based on data made publicly available free of charge from [https://www.morningstar.com/ Morningstar]. Data for the CPI is CPI-U, "CPI for All Urban Consumers," not seasonally adjusted, obtained from the [https://www.bls.gov/ Bureau of Labor Statistics].&lt;/ref&gt; The possibility of making less is depicted in two ways:

1) What ''percentage'' of the time would you have made less than in a money market fund? We chose VMMXX, the Vanguard Prime Money Market Fund, because it is one of the oldest money market fund and gave us a long period of comparison. We also show what percentage of the time you would have actually lost money--ended up with less than $10,000 at the end of the time period--and what percentage of time you would have failed to keep up with inflation.

2) It's important to know not just when a fund or ETF underperformed a money market mutual fund, but by how much. In the case of short-term funds, the losses, when they did occur, were so small that some might call them negligible To quantify this, we present two numbers. One is the average loss that occurred ''in those periods in which losses did occur;'' and the other is the largest loss that ever occurred within the body of data that was used.

Notice that a high probability of underperforming may not be important at all. If two investments have the same return and volatility, but just fluctuate randomly with respect to each other, you would expect each of them to underperform the other about 50% of the time. 

We have chosen to present data going back for as far as Morningstar has data. As a result, there are two caveats. First, the data range shown for each fund is different and results for different funds cannot be directly compared. For example, the Vanguard Short-Term Treasury Fund, VFISX, beat VMMXX by an average of $117.10 while the Vanguard Short-Term Treasury ''Index'' fund, VGSH, only beat it by $33.17. But this is almost entirely due to VGSH's inception in 2009 versus VFISX's inception in 1991. If we restrict our view of VFISX to the same years as VGSH, the benefit for VFISX was only $44.05. Second, this underlines the problem with all historical data, which is that the present time--and thus the short-term future--may be quite different from the historical averages.

===Median and average (mean)===
We show both the average and the median for some key values. A reader requested this. We have a scattered group of values: the return from an investment over many different periods of time. To represent the center of such a group with a single number, we often calculate and average or mean. In the case here, when we are looking, for example, at losses, and only seeing "the tail of the distribution," the average may give the wrong impression because it's influenced by extreme values. The median is another measure, and represents the value that is halfway based on counting. If the median loss of an investment is $600, it means you had a 50% chance of losing more over $600 and a 50% chance of losing less than $600.

===Holding bond funds for the average "duration" of the fund===
A "duration" is a calculation based on bond math that gives a number of years, related to the bond's term but shorter. One interpretation of the duration is that it is the "point of indifference." It is too well known that when interest rates rise, bond values fall. What is less well known is that if a bond is held for its duration, at the end of that period of time it will have the same value regardless of what interest rates do, provided the yield curve moves in parallel. This does not apply to a bond ''fund'' because the bonds in a fund are all different "ages" at any given time, and because the yield curve doesn't move in parallel. So there are no guarantees, but, nevertheless, the duration tells us a holding period over which the fund is unlikely to lose money.

This leads us to expect, for example, that "short-term" bond funds--like the Vanguard Short-Term Bond Index Fund, with a duration of 2.7 years--will sometimes lose money over periods of 6 or 12 months, but rarely lose money over periods of 5 years. This expectation is borne out by history.

A bond fund may not lose money, in the sense of dollars, yet lose value to inflation.

In investing, we make personal choices about how much [[Risk and return: an introduction|risk]] we are willing to take if we think we can get higher return in exchange. '''{{PAGENAME}}''' compares historical performance of similar funds that are appropriate for [[short-term]] savings.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt; John Bogle, in his 1994 classic, ''Bogle on Mutual Funds'', suggested using a low-cost short-term treasury bond fund, with its government backed credit rating, as a prudent substitute for a money market fund for investment reserves distinct from savings and transaction account balances. (p.132 in the text)&lt;/ref&gt;

Volatility--fluctuations in value--are an important aspect of risk. In financial economics, volatility is often measured by a statistical value called the [[wikipedia:Standard deviation| standard deviation]], represented by the Greek letter ''sigma'' (σ). The standard deviation of mutual funds can be found on sites like [http://www.morningstar.com Morningstar] or [https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/fund-performance PortfolioVisualizer]. However, it is hard to relate this number to a practical question, like "how much risk would I be taking by putting money I need a year from now into a short-term bond fund instead of a money market fund?" This article tries to help with this kind of question.

==Overview==
In this article, we calculate some other measures of risk by calculating what would have happened to an investment of $10,000, held for short periods of time, in a [[mutual fund]] or [[exchange-traded fund]] (ETF). You might do this in hope of making more than you would have made in a money market mutual fund, and accepting the possibility of sometimes making less.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt; For funds and ETFs, calculations are based on data made publicly available free of charge from [https://www.morningstar.com/ Morningstar]. Data for the CPI is CPI-U, "CPI for All Urban Consumers," not seasonally adjusted, obtained from the [https://www.bls.gov/ Bureau of Labor Statistics].&lt;/ref&gt; The possibility of making less is depicted in two ways:

1) What ''percentage'' of the time would you have made less than in a money market fund? We chose VMMXX, the Vanguard Prime Money Market Fund, because it is one of the oldest money market fund and gave us a long period of comparison. We also show what percentage of the time you would have actually lost money--ended up with less than $10,000 at the end of the time period--and what percentage of time you would have failed to keep up with inflation.

2) It's important to know not just when a fund or ETF underperformed a money market mutual fund, but by how much. In the case of short-term funds, the losses, when they did occur, were so small that some might call them negligible To quantify this, we present two numbers. One is the average loss that occurred ''in those periods in which losses did occur;'' and the other is the largest loss that ever occurred within the body of data that was used.

Notice that a high probability of underperforming may not be important at all. If two investments have the same return and volatility, but just fluctuate randomly with respect to each other, you would expect each of them to underperform the other about 50% of the time. 

We have chosen to present data going back for as far as Morningstar has data. As a result, there are two caveats. First, the data range shown for each fund is different and results for different funds cannot be directly compared. For example, the Vanguard Short-Term Treasury Fund, VFISX, beat VMMXX by an average of $117.10 while the Vanguard Short-Term Treasury ''Index'' fund, VGSH, only beat it by $33.17. But this is almost entirely due to VGSH's inception in 2009 versus VFISX's inception in 1991. If we restrict our view of VFISX to the same years as VGSH, the benefit for VFISX was only $44.05. Second, this underlines the problem with all historical data, which is that the present time--and thus the short-term future--may be quite different from the historical averages.

===Median and average (mean)===
We show both the average and the median for some key values. A reader requested this. We have a scattered group of values: the return from an investment over many different periods of time. To represent the center of such a group with a single number, we often calculate and average or mean. In the case here, when we are looking, for example, at losses, and only seeing "the tail of the distribution," the average may give the wrong impression because it's influenced by extreme values. The median is another measure, and represents the value that is halfway based on counting. If the median loss of an investment is $600, it means you had a 50% chance of losing more over $600 and a 50% chance of losing less than $600.

===Holding bond funds for the average "duration" of the fund===
A "duration" is a calculation based on bond math that gives a number of years, related to the bond's term but shorter. One interpretation of the duration is that it is the "point of indifference." It is too well known that when interest rates rise, bond values fall. What is less well known is that if a bond is held for its duration, at the end of that period of time it will have the same value regardless of what interest rates do, provided the yield curve moves in parallel. This does not apply to a bond ''fund'' because the bonds in a fund are all different "ages" at any given time, and because the yield curve doesn't move in parallel. So there are no guarantees, but, nevertheless, the duration tells us a holding period over which the fund is unlikely to lose money.

This leads us to expect, for example, that "short-term" bond funds--like the Vanguard Short-Term Bond Index Fund, with a duration of 2.7 years--will sometimes lose money over periods of 6 or 12 months, but rarely lose money over periods of 5 years. This expectation is borne out by history.

A bond fund may not lose money, in the sense of dollars, yet lose value to inflation.

In investing, we make personal choices about how much [[Risk and return: an introduction|risk]] we are willing to take if we think we can get higher return in exchange. '''{{PAGENAME}}''' compares historical performance of similar funds that are appropriate for [[short-term]] savings.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt; John Bogle, in his 1994 classic, ''Bogle on Mutual Funds'', suggested using a low-cost short-term treasury bond fund, with its government backed credit rating, as a prudent substitute for a money market fund for investment reserves distinct from savings and transaction account balances. (p.132 in the text)&lt;/ref&gt;

Volatility--fluctuations in value--are an important aspect of risk. In financial economics, volatility is often measured by a statistical value called the [[wikipedia:Standard deviation| standard deviation]], represented by the Greek letter ''sigma'' (σ). The standard deviation of mutual funds can be found on sites like [http://www.morningstar.com Morningstar] or [https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/fund-performance PortfolioVisualizer]. However, it is hard to relate this number to a practical question, like "how much risk would I be taking by putting money I need a year from now into a short-term bond fund instead of a money market fund?" This article tries to help with this kind of question.

==Overview==
In this article, we calculate some other measures of risk by calculating what would have happened to an investment of $10,000, held for short periods of time, in a [[mutual fund]] or [[exchange-traded fund]] (ETF). You might do this in hope of making more than you would have made in a money market mutual fund, and accepting the possibility of sometimes making less.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt; For funds and ETFs, calculations are based on data made publicly available free of charge from [https://www.morningstar.com/ Morningstar]. Data for the CPI is CPI-U, "CPI for All Urban Consumers," not seasonally adjusted, obtained from the [https://www.bls.gov/ Bureau of Labor Statistics].&lt;/ref&gt; The possibility of making less is depicted in two ways:

1) What ''percentage'' of the time would you have made less than in a money market fund? We chose VMMXX, the Vanguard Prime Money Market Fund, because it is one of the oldest money market fund and gave us a long period of comparison. We also show what percentage of the time you would have actually lost money--ended up with less than $10,000 at the end of the time period--and what percentage of time you would have failed to keep up with inflation.

2) It's important to know not just when a fund or ETF underperformed a money market mutual fund, but by how much. In the case of short-term funds, the losses, when they did occur, were so small that some might call them negligible To quantify this, we present two numbers. One is the average loss that occurred ''in those periods in which losses did occur;'' and the other is the largest loss that ever occurred within the body of data that was used.

Notice that a high probability of underperforming may not be important at all. If two investments have the same return and volatility, but just fluctuate randomly with respect to each other, you would expect each of them to underperform the other about 50% of the time. 

We have chosen to present data going back for as far as Morningstar has data. As a result, there are two caveats. First, the data range shown for each fund is different and results for different funds cannot be directly compared. For example, the Vanguard Short-Term Treasury Fund, VFISX, beat VMMXX by an average of $117.10 while the Vanguard Short-Term Treasury ''Index'' fund, VGSH, only beat it by $33.17. But this is almost entirely due to VGSH's inception in 2009 versus VFISX's inception in 1991. If we restrict our view of VFISX to the same years as VGSH, the benefit for VFISX was only $44.05. Second, this underlines the problem with all historical data, which is that the present time--and thus the short-term future--may be quite different from the historical averages.

===Median and average (mean)===
We show both the average and the median for some key values. A reader requested this. We have a scattered group of values: the return from an investment over many different periods of time. To represent the center of such a group with a single number, we often calculate and average or mean. In the case here, when we are looking, for example, at losses, and only seeing "the tail of the distribution," the average may give the wrong impression because it's influenced by extreme values. The median is another measure, and represents the value that is halfway based on counting. If the median loss of an investment is $600, it means you had a 50% chance of losing more over $600 and a 50% chance of losing less than $600.

===Holding bond funds for the average "duration" of the fund===
A "duration" is a calculation based on bond math that gives a number of years, related to the bond's term but shorter. One interpretation of the duration is that it is the "point of indifference." It is too well known that when interest rates rise, bond values fall. What is less well known is that if a bond is held for its duration, at the end of that period of time it will have the same value regardless of what interest rates do, provided the yield curve moves in parallel. This does not apply to a bond ''fund'' because the bonds in a fund are all different "ages" at any given time, and because the yield curve doesn't move in parallel. So there are no guarantees, but, nevertheless, the duration tells us a holding period over which the fund is unlikely to lose money.

This leads us to expect, for example, that "short-term" bond funds--like the Vanguard Short-Term Bond Index Fund, with a duration of 2.7 years--will sometimes lose money over periods of 6 or 12 months, but rarely lose money over periods of 5 years. This expectation is borne out by history.

A bond fund may not lose money, in the sense of dollars, yet lose value to inflation.

===Holding stocks "for five years"===
Authorities advice against using stocks for money you will need in less than five years; '''Vanguard says ten.''' If you are considering using stocks for money you will need in five years, then you should familiarize yourself with the data for stocks held for five years. See [[Using mutual funds and ETFs for short-term savings (5 years)]]. 

Vanguard itself puts all of it stock funds in risk categories 4 and 5 and says "these funds may be appropriate for investors who have a long-term investment horizon '''(10 years or longer).'''" 

A few other authorities say:

"Do not invest any money in stocks you will need in less than five years.”—William J. Bernstein, ''The Four Pillars of Investing''.

“A rule of thumb in investing is that you should not invest money in stocks or stock funds that you will need in less than five years.”—Jack Brennan and Marta McCave, “Straight Talk on Investing.” 

“Owning stocks for the short term (less than five years) is foolish.”—''Kiplinger’s Personal Finance'', Nov, 2004.  

“Money you know you will need in the five to 10 years does not belong in stocks.”—Suze Orman, ''Suze Orman’s Action Plan''. 

Even Jim Cramer has said “If you need the money for something serious in the next four years, you cannot risk keeping it in stocks.”--Jim Cramer, ''Getting Back to Even''.

Investors are faced with a variety of choices on ''where'' to invest their money; for example, a [[taxable account]], a [[401(k)]], or an [[Traditional IRA |IRA]]. Knowing which accounts to invest in first will maximize return with a minimum of [[Tax-efficient fund placement|taxes]]. '''Prioritizing investments''' indicates the appropriate order in which investments go into these accounts.

Take care to ensure that any investment priority decision aligns with your [[Investment policy statement| Investment Policy Statement]].

This page describes the approximate order of accounts (and debts) that income should be contributed toward while working and accumulating assets. The corresponding order for withdrawing assets for spending in retirement is described in [[Retirement draw-down priority]].

==Funding priority==

Here is a general account funding priority that often works well for many people&lt;ref name="mmm"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://forum.mrmoneymustache.com/investor-alley/investment-order/msg1333153/#msg1333153| title=Investment order| publisher=Mr. Money Mustache Forum| date=December 8, 2016| accessdate=June 5, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.whitecoatinvestor.com/hrf_faq/what-order-should-i-fund-my-accounts-in/| title=What order should I fund my investing accounts in?| publisher=White Coat Investor| date=May 5, 2017| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230327073953/https://www.whitecoatinvestor.com/hrf_faq/what-order-should-i-fund-my-accounts-in/| archive-date=March 27, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://thefinancebuff.com/401k-roth-ira-then-back-at-401k.html| title=401(k), Roth IRA, then Back at 401(k)| publisher=The Finance Buff| date=October 22, 2006| accessdate=June 5, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; (not all points will apply to everyone).

|-
|colspan = "3" style="text-align:left;"| HSAs offer tax-free contributions, growth, and withdrawals when used for qualified medical expenses. You can view HSA contributions as being matched by the IRS.&lt;ref name="grabiner"/&gt; If you are in a 25% tax bracket, it costs you $750 to put $1000 in your HSA, and once it is there, it will not be taxed at all as long as you spend it for medical care, so this is as good as $1000 in a Roth IRA.&lt;ref name="grabiner"/&gt;{{#tag:ref|If you are in a 25% tax bracket, it costs you $750 to put $1000 in your HSA, and once it is there, it will not be taxed at all as along as you spend it for medical care.&lt;ref name="grabiner"/&gt; This means the deductible also gets discounted by your tax rate: this should be taken into account when comparing deductibles with non-HSA plans. Note that health plans with a [[Flexible spending arrangement|Flexible Spending Arrangement]] (FSA) also offer tax deductions; however, the FSA is a ''use-it-or-lose-it'' plan, with balances normally zeroed out at the end of every year.|group=note}}

After age 65, the HSA can also be used for non-medical expenses, with such withdrawals taxed at your regular tax rate. So if you are unlucky and are too healthy after 65, the HSA is still as good as a pre-tax retirement account.&lt;ref name="grabiner"&gt;{{Forum link| p=1962306| title=Prioritizing investments- HSA goes where? |author=grabiner| date=February 16, 2014}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike pre-tax retirement accounts, HSA contributions made through an employer are also [[payroll tax]]-deductible.

Use of an HSA requires participation in an IRS qualified [[High deductible health plan| high deductible health plan]] (HDHP) at work. Look at your particular health care needs to decide if you may be better off with a traditional health care plan or an HDHP plus HSA. If the latter, then using the HSA as an investment account can be advantageous.

You may have to choose among [[IRA#Comparison_to_employer_accounts|IRA vs. employer plan]] and/or [[traditional vs. Roth]] accounts. Consult those articles for more details.

Deductible IRA contributions are subject to income limits, but the income limit for contributing to a Roth IRA may be circumvented by the [[Backdoor Roth]] process.&lt;ref group="note"&gt; You should verify eligibility before making traditional IRA contributions: in particular, check the [https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/ira-deduction-limits tax-deduction limit]. For Roth IRAs, the [[backdoor Roth]] is a technique for making contributions when your income exceeds the [https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/plan-participant-employee/retirement-topics-ira-contribution-limits eligibility limit]. It is complicated in nature and may not be for everyone. Read the [[Backdoor Roth IRA#Cautions| Cautions]] section of the article before proceeding and ask in the forum if you are unsure.&lt;/ref&gt; Employer plans may also offer [[mega-backdoor Roth]] contributions, but these should be made only after normal contributions.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;This technique is only available through select employer plans; it is complicated in nature and may not be for everyone. Read the [[Mega-backdoor Roth#Determining if your plan supports the mega-backdoor Roth|Mega-backdoor Roth]] article to determine if your plan supports it, and ask in the forum if you are unsure.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''governmental''' [[457(b)]] behaves similarly to a 401(k) or 403(b), except that 457(b)s have no early (before age 59½) withdrawal penalties. If a governmental 457(b) has reasonable investments and low fees, it usually makes sense to contribute to one ''before'' other retirement accounts. '''Non-governmental''' 457(b)s and [[Non-qualified retirement plan|non-qualified retirement plans]] function very differently than most other retirement accounts; see [[#Less_common_accounts|below]] for details on whether and how these should be used.

'''Choosing between an employer retirement plan and an IRA'''

If the company plan offers good, low-cost funds, it may be preferable to contribute to the company plan ''before'' contributing to an IRA; see: [[IRA#Comparison to employer accounts|Comparison between IRAs and employer plans]].

Also, your [[Marginal tax rate|marginal tax rate]] may influence the decision: those subject to higher marginal tax rates should consider higher contributions to a tax-deferred plan (for example, traditional 401(k) or IRA) rather than a post-tax plan (for example, Roth 401(k) or IRA). See [[Traditional versus Roth]] for more guidance.

If you prefer traditional to Roth, and traditional contributions to the employer's plan are needed to reduce your [[Modified_Adjusted_Gross_Income#MAGI_for_traditional_IRA_purposes|Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI) for traditional IRA purposes]] enough to allow a full or partial IRA deduction (see [https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/ira-deduction-limits IRA Deduction Limits]), consider contributing to an employer plan before an IRA.

'''Employer plans with high cost funds'''

Many company plans contain [[401(k)#Expensive or mediocre choices|high-cost]] funds which make them unattractive. If you have such a plan, look for one or two index funds or a bond fund that can be used. If your company offers matching funds up to a certain contribution level, it is '''always''' wise to use the company plan. If there is no match, the power of tax-deferred compounding and automatic contributions still favors using the plan with limited contributions.

Also, if you leave your current employer you will most likely be able to rollover the assets in your poor-quality company plan to either a better company plan, or to an IRA.

==Less common accounts==

===Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP)===

If your employer offers an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP), it may be very beneficial to use, though a lower priority than getting a retirement match. A typical ESPP allows you to buy shares of your employer's publicly-traded stock at a significant discount from the market price. After a contribution and holding period (usually six months), you can withdraw the shares and sell them on the open market for a profit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fidelity.com/go/stock-plan-services/employee-stock-purchase-plans|title=Invest in your work and your future with an ESPP|publisher=Fidelity|accessdate=Aug 31, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the plan allows shares to be sold immediately, there is little to no market risk for the stock and the plan is like free money, albeit with an interruption in cash flow and some extra paperwork. Once you have gone through one contribution period, proceeds from the plan will offset contributions, and your cash flow will be neutral with an excellent rate of return. Details vary, so check with your company's benefits department.

However, if the plan requires shares to be held for a significant time after the contribution period, that exposes you to significant concentrated market risk and also lowers the rate of return, and the benefit of the plan is more questionable. In any case, voluntarily holding onto company stock for longer than necessary to get the plan benefits is usually not advised, due to the concentrated risk of simultaneous crash of the stock price and loss of your job. 

===Non-governmental 457(b) plan===
{{Main|457(b)}}

Despite the similarity in name, non-governmental 457(b)s are very different from governmental 457(b)s and other retirement accounts; they are more of a deferred compensation plan. Compared to other retirement plans, non-governmental 457(b)s have several major drawbacks: 

* The balance cannot be rolled into an [[IRA]] upon separation from the employer
* The distribution options may be poor, possibly forcing you to withdraw all your assets in the year you separate from the employer and concentrating all that taxable income in one year
* Assets in the plan are legally property of the employer until distributed to you, raising [[asset protection]] concerns

Read the plan documents carefully, particularly the distribution options, and consider your employer's financial health before deciding to invest in a non-governmental 457(b). It usually makes sense to use a non-governmental 457(b) only after other retirement accounts, if at all. If a non-governmental 457(b) makes sense to use, the lack of early withdrawal penalties can be useful in certain situations, such as early retirement.

===Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation (NQDC) plan===
{{Main|Non-qualified retirement plan}}

Some companies allow some employees (often limited to those above some rank) to defer compensation until after leaving that company. As noted in the brief wiki section, Deferred compensation plan (non-qualified), and various forum topics such as Deferred compensation worth it? (search for "deferred compensation" to find others), details on these plans vary widely.

An NQDC plan may be particularly valuable to a highly paid employee because it allows you to defer tax at high marginal tax rates on amounts much greater than 401(k) and similar plans do. The plan will not, however, be valuable at all if the company goes bankrupt, or may be less valuable than expected if you continue to work elsewhere and must add NQDC distributions to your employed earnings.

You need to decide whether to invest the cash immediately as a lump sum or adopt a strategy known as [[dollar cost averaging]] (DCA), where you make a series of investments over time. DCA aims to reduce the risk of investing the entire lump sum immediately before a market downturn.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=April 21, 2023 |title=Lump-sum investing versus cost averaging: Which is better? |url=https://investor.vanguard.com/investor-resources-education/news/lump-sum-investing-versus-cost-averaging-which-is-better |access-date=2025-01-16 |website=Vanguard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The short answer is that lump-sum investing is the better choice about two-thirds of the time. DCA can provide certain behavioral advantages that can minimize downside risk and reduce feelings of [[Regret aversion|regret]].  

==Why choose to lump-sum invest==
The main reason to invest all of it as a lump sum is you gain exposure to the markets as soon as possible and historical market trends indicate that [[Stock|stocks]] and [[Bond|bonds]] returns exceed returns on cash investments.

Lump-sum investing will always carry a higher expected return, because it immediately moves your funds from asset classes with lower expected returns to ones with higher expected returns. Note that higher ''expected'' returns do not guarantee that your ''actual'' returns will be higher. 

A Vanguard study concluded that lump-sum investing has historically produced higher returns two thirds of the time when the DCA plan was implemented over 12 months. Lump sum was also more favorable when the analysis used risk-adjusted returns. DCA plans with longer timelines have worse results.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Shtekhman A, Tasopoulos C, Wimmer B (2012) [https://web.archive.org/web/20190404110643/https://personal.vanguard.com/pdf/s315.pdf Dollar-cost averaging just means taking risk later], Vanguard Research Paper, viewed August 31, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

A related Vanguard publication notes that if a DCA plan was implemented over 36 months, lump-sum investing produced higher returns approximately 92% of the time. In addition, over a 12-month period, the maximum downside potential of DCA was higher than the maximum upside potential.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Berkowitz|first=Daniel B.|date=2016|title=Invest now or temporarily hold your cash?|url=https://www.optimizedportfolio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/vanguard-invest-now-or-temporarily-hold-your-cash.pdf|publisher=Vanguard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Why not lump-sum invest==
The main reason to choose not to lump-sum invest is if the investor is primarily concerned with minimizing downside risk and potential feelings of regret (resulting from lump-sum investing immediately before a market downturn), then DCA may be of use.

==Study results==
A variety of studies have covered the lump sum versus cost averaging question and generally they come to the following conclusions.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Finlay|first=Megan|last2=Zorn|first2=Josef|date=February 2023|title=Cost averaging: Invest now or temporarily hold your cash?|url=https://corporate.vanguard.com/content/dam/corp/research/pdf/cost_averaging_invest_now_or_temporarily_hold_your_cash.pdf|website=Vanguard research}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Lauricella|first=Tom|date=November 26, 2019|title=Dollar-cost averaging vs. lump-sum investing|url=https://www.morningstar.ca/ca/news/197440/dollar-cost-averaging-vs-lump-sum-investing.aspx|access-date=2025-01-16|website=Morningstar Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Lump-sum investment strategies beat common cost averaging investment strategies two-thirds of the time, according to historical and simulated  market data.
*Despite the expectation of lower returns, cost averaging might be considered for investors with very high aversion to both risk and [[Loss aversion|losses]] who might be tempted to hold a lump sum entirely in cash.

It consists of global stocks and bonds, held in [[Free-float methodology|free-float]] market proportions.&lt;ref name=RISMAT-7&gt;{{Cite web|author=William F.

The Market Portfolio|url=https://web.stanford.edu/~wfsharpe/RISMAT/RISMAT-7.pdf|publisher=Stanford University (Creative Commons)|accessdate=June 16, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Components ==

There is currently no single retail fund that implements a World Bond/Stock (WBS) portfolio in the way described by Sharpe. To address this, he has suggested a four-fund proxy&lt;ref name=RISMAT-7/&gt;&lt;ref name=4-Fund-Proxy&gt;{{Cite web|author=William F. Sharpe|title=The Four-fund Proxy for the World Bond Stock Fund|url=https://retirementincomeanalysis.blogspot.com/2019/08/the-four-fund-proxy-for-wold-bond-stock.html|date=August 2019|accessdate=June 16, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also a two-fund proxy&lt;ref name=2-Fund-Proxy&gt;{{Cite web|author=William F. Sharpe|title=A Two-fund Proxy for the World Bond Stock Fund|url=https://retirementincomeanalysis.blogspot.com/2019/09/a-two-fund-proxy-for-world-bond-stock.html|date=September 2019|accessdate=June 16, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt; for WBS consisting of established Vanguard index funds.

A four-fund proxy for WBS consists of:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Component fund !! Asset class
|-
| VTSAX (or VTI) || US stocks
|-
| VTIAX (or VXUS) || Ex-US stocks
|-
| VBTLX (or BND) || USD bonds
|-
| VTABX (or BNDX)  || Ex-USD bonds
|-
|}

A two-fund proxy for WBS consists of:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Component fund !! Asset class
|-
| VT || Global stocks
|-
| BNDW || Global bonds
|-
|}

Of course, it is also possible to implement something similar with non-Vanguard funds.

== Allocations ==

The index funds used by the WBS proxies described above are held in proportion to their free-float market capitalization. That requires calculating the market capitalization of the index that each fund tracks. This is done by taking each index's market capitalization listed in its most recent factsheet, and then projecting that forward by the change in the fund's adjusted closing prices between the factsheet's publishing date and the current date.

&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{IndexMarketCap}_\mathrm{Current} = \mathrm{IndexMarketCap}_\mathrm{Factsheet} \times \frac{\mathrm{TrackingFundPrice}_\mathrm{Current}}{\mathrm{TrackingFundPrice}_{\mathrm{FactsheetDate}}}
&lt;/math&gt;

Note: VBTLX/BND, VTABX/BNDX, and BNDW track Bloomberg indices which do not publish their market capitalization numbers.  Sharpe has suggested that FTSE indexes (for example, WorldBIG) could substitute.&lt;ref name=RISMAT-7/&gt;&lt;ref name=4-Fund-Proxy/&gt;

=== Example ===

Here is an example of the allocation calculations as of June 15, 2025:

(= $90.42T * $124.95 / $123.37)
| 62.43%
(= $91.58T / ($55.08T + $91.58T))
|-
| BNDW
| Global bonds
| FTSE WorldBIG (substitute for Bloomberg index)

| May 31, 2025
| $68.58

| 37.57%

Here are the current allocations for the four-fund proxy, updated in real time:

|}

Note: The total allocation to VTI and VXUS in the four-fund proxy might not precisely equal the VT allocation in the two-fund proxy. This is because VTI tracks a [[CRSP equity indexes|CRSP]] index which differs slightly from the [[FTSE Group|FTSE]] index that VT tracks.

== Rebalancing ==
{{See also|Rebalancing}}

The World Bond/Stock (WBS) portfolio holds each individual asset (that is, individual stock or bond) in proportion to its free-float market capitalization. Equivalently, it holds the same fraction of each asset’s free-float shares outstanding. That is, '''(shares held) / (free-float shares outstanding)''' is the same for every individual asset.

Framing WBS this way shows that rebalancing is needed only when an asset’s free-float supply changes the fraction of shares held (for example, new issuances, buybacks, or redemptions).

Conversely, events like price changes and dividend payments do ''not'' require rebalancing since they leave the fraction of shares held unchanged. As a result, WBS requires less frequent rebalancing than traditional fixed-weight portfolios (for example, a 60/40 stock/bond mix), which must rebalance whenever asset prices change.

If WBS assets are held through a ''single'' index fund, the fund handles rebalancing internally. But if assets are split across ''multiple funds'' (for example, stocks in VT and bonds in BNDW), their underlying free-float supply may change at different rates. This causes the share fractions held by the different funds to drift apart, requiring occasional manual rebalancing between the funds to realign them.

== Adjusting for personal circumstances ==

The World Bond/Stock portfolio mirrors the holdings of the average publicly invested portfolio, thereby taking on average investment risk and producing average return.&lt;ref name=Arithmetic&gt;{{Cite web|author=William F. Sharpe|title=The Arithmetic of Active Management|url=https://web.stanford.edu/~wfsharpe/art/active/active.htm|publisher=Association for Investment Management and Research|date=February 1991|accessdate=June 16, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt; This makes it a good default strategy.

Nevertheless, Sharpe notes that someone may justifiably deviate from this strategy to adjust for personal circumstances.&lt;ref name=Adjust&gt;{{Cite web|author=Charles Rotblut, William F. Sharpe|title=Allocate by Market Weight (And Adjust for Personal Circumstances)|url=https://www.aaii.com/files/PDF/9314_allocate-by-market-weight-and-adjust-for-personal-circumstances.pdf|publisher=American Association of Individual Investors|accessdate=June 16, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Adjustments discussed by Sharpe include:
* '''Adding a riskless asset.'''  For example, using certain inflation-adjusted investments (like [[Treasury Inflation Protected Security|TIPS]]) to cover a portion of real expenses.&lt;ref name=RISMAT-6&gt;{{Cite web|author=William F. Sharpe|title=Retirement Income Analysis with scenario matrices, Chapter 6. Inflation-Protected Investments|url=https://web.stanford.edu/~wfsharpe/RISMAT/RISMAT-6.pdf|publisher=Stanford University (Creative Commons)|accessdate=June 16, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Tilting asset allocations.''' For example, adjusting the stock/bond ratio to account for factors like [[Human capital|human capital]].&lt;ref name=Adjust/&gt;

=== Tilting using adaptive asset allocation ===

Sharpe proposes Adaptive Asset Allocation Policies, which allow asset class tilting while still remaining anchored to the dynamics of the WBS portfolio.&lt;ref name=AAAP&gt;{{Cite web|author=William F. Sharpe|title=Adaptive Asset Allocation Policies |url=https://web.stanford.edu/~wfsharpe/aaap/wfsaaap.pdf|publisher=Stanford University|accessdate=June 16, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt; This enables customization while continuously adapting to changes in the relative risk between asset classes.

It works as follows. Start with a desired initial allocation. Then update each asset class weight using:

&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{UpdatedWeight} = 
\mathrm{CurrentMarketWeight} \times
\frac{\mathrm{InitialDesiredWeight}}{\mathrm{InitialMarketWeight}}
&lt;/math&gt;

Finally, normalize the updated weights to get the new allocation.  For example:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Component fund
! Asset class
! Initial desired weight
! Initial market weight
! Current market weight
! Updated weight
! Normalized allocation
|-
| VT
| Global stocks
| 80%
| 60%
| 55%
| 73.33%
(= 55% * 80/60)
| 76.52%
(= 73.33 / (73.33 + 22.50))
|-
| BNDW
| Global bonds
| 20%
| 40%
| 45%
| 22.50%
(=45% * 20/40)
| 23.48%
(= 22.50 / (73.33 + 22.50))
|-
|}
