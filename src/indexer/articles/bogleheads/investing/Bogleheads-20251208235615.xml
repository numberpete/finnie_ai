'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a term used to define a company that is involved in the exploration or production of a precious metal. Common precious metals include [[Gold|gold]], silver, platinum, iridium, rhodium, and palladium.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/preciousmetal.asp definiition], investopedia. &lt;/ref&gt; Some investors prefer using gold mining stocks as a substitute for gold bullion in an investment portfolio, and use a [[Mutual fund|mutual fund]] or [[Exchange Traded Funds|exchange traded fund]] that invests in gold mining stocks. The precious metal mining industry is a global industry; so the funds that invest in precious metals equity are [[Global fund|global funds]].

==Risks==
Precious metal mining stocks are subject to a number of risks. These risks include:

* '''Market risk''': Mining stocks are subject to the forces that affect the overall stock market. 
* '''Concentration risk''': Mining stocks are a small subsector of the market, and are affected by the economic and political forces that can affect precious metals and precious metal mining companies.
* '''Currency risk''': For U.S. investors, the returns realized from foreign mining companies are subject to the rise and fall of currency exchange rates.

==Role in a portfolio==
The following arguments support the inclusion of precious metal (gold) mining stocks in an investment portfolio.
* Unlike gold bullion, mining stocks produce economic value by profiting from the extraction and processing of metals. Shareholder's receive this value through the distribution of profits via dividends.
* Precious metal mining stocks have historically realized low correlations to the broad U.S. stock market and the U.S. treasury bond market. In addition, precious metal mining stocks historically have been volatile. While the returns of precious metals equity have been lower than the broad market, the characteristics of low correlation and high volatility are features which provide for positive returns for a rebalanced portfolio. [[William Bernstein]] finds that disciplined rebalancing precious metals equity has historically added a five percent bonus to precious metals equity returns.&lt;ref name="Longest discipline"&gt; [http://www.efficientfrontier.com/ef/adhoc/gold.htm  The Longest Discipline], by William J. Bernstein &lt;/ref&gt;.
* Bernstein also notes that precious metals equity requires a very long investment horizon, as returns of this sector can have very long periods of poor performance.&lt;ref name="Longest discipline"/&gt; 

Investors who include gold bullion in asset class selection usually do not consider precious metals equity as a suitable replacement for bullion in a portfolio. In this view, commodity gold provides an insurance function against disorder in currency, equity, and bond markets that precious metals mining stocks, as stocks, cannot reliably provide.&lt;ref&gt; [[Craig Rowland]] and [[J. M. Lawson]], ''The Permanent Portfolio: Harry Browne's Long-Term Investment Strategy'', John Wiley &amp; Sons (2012) ISBN 978-1118288252 &lt;/ref&gt;

==Precious metals equity and gold stock indexes==

Commonly sited indexes of gold stocks include the NYSE Arca Gold BUGS Index, the Philadelphia Gold and Silver Index, and the NYSE Arca Gold Miners Index.

* '''NYSE Arca Gold BUGS''' (Basket of Unhedged Gold Stocks) Index (HUI) is a modified equal dollar weighted index of companies involved in gold mining. The HUI Index was designed to provide significant exposure to near term movements in gold prices by including companies that do not hedge their gold production beyond 1.5 years. The HUI Index was developed with a base value of 200.00 as of March 15, 1996.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amex.com/othProd/prodInf/OpPiIndMain.jsp?Product_Symbol=HUI HUI], New York Stock Exchange&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Historical data can be found at [[https://www.nyse.com/search?q=hui&amp;site=IntercontinentalExchange%7CNYSE%7Cinstruments%7CtheICE%7CtheICEProductGuide%7CtheICEReports&amp;client=nyse_frontend_html&amp;proxystylesheet=nyse_frontend_html&amp;output=xml_no_dtd&amp;filter=0&amp;getfields=* NYSE Arca Gold BUGS Index (HUI)]. There is also a short index: [https://www.nyse.com/search?q=huish&amp;site=IntercontinentalExchange%7CNYSE%7Cinstruments%7CtheICE%7CtheICEProductGuide%7CtheICEReports&amp;client=nyse_frontend_html&amp;proxystylesheet=nyse_frontend_html&amp;output=xml_no_dtd&amp;filter=0&amp;getfields=* NYSE Arca Gold BUGS Short Index (HUISH)]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Philadelphia Gold and Silver Index''' (XUA) is a capitalization-weighted index composed of 16 companies involved in the gold and silver mining industry. XAU was set to an initial value of 100 in January 1979.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.nasdaqtrader.com/micro.aspx?id=phlxsectorscontractspecs#XAU NASDAQ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.kitco.com/pop_windows/stocks/xau.html Stock prices of indexed companies at kitco.com] &lt;/ref&gt;
* '''NYSE Arca Gold Miners Index''' (GDM) is a modified market capitalization weighted index comprised of publicly traded companies involved primarily in the mining for gold and silver. The Index divisor was initially determined to yield a benchmark value of 500.00 at the close of trading on December 20, 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amex.com/othProd/prodInf/OpPiIndMain.jsp?Product_Symbol=GDM GDM], New York Stock Exchange&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Historical data can be found at [https://www.nyse.com/search?q=gdm&amp;site=IntercontinentalExchange%7CNYSE%7Cinstruments%7CtheICE%7CtheICEProductGuide%7CtheICEReports&amp;client=nyse_frontend_html&amp;proxystylesheet=nyse_frontend_html&amp;output=xml_no_dtd&amp;filter=0&amp;getfields=* NYSE Arca Gold Miners Index (GDM)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, S&amp;P&lt;ref&gt;[http://us.spindices.com/indices/equity/sp-global-bmi-gold-us-dollar The S&amp;P Global BMI Gold Index] &lt;/ref&gt; and MSCI&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.msci.com/resources/factsheets/index_fact_sheet/msci-acwi-select-gold-miners-imi-net.pdf MSCI ACWI Select Gold Miners IMI factsheet]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.msci.com/resources/factsheets/index_fact_sheet/msci-acwi-select-silver-miners-imi-net.pdf MSCI ACWI Select Silver Miners IMI factsheet] &lt;/ref&gt; provide indexes of gold and silver mining stocks. Dow Jones provides  a Precious Metals Index&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.djindexes.com/mdsidx/downloads/fact_info/Dow_Jones_Precious_Metals_Index_Fact_Sheet.pdf Dow Jones Precious Metals Fact Sheet] &lt;/ref&gt;

==Mutual funds==
The U.S. mutual fund universe contains a sizable number of gold and precious metals funds, all of which are actively managed funds, and many which are broker-distributed load funds. Morningstar tracks performance of these funds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.morningstar.com/fund-category-returns/equity-precious-metals/$FOCA$SP.aspx Equity Precious Metals: Total Returns], Morningstar &lt;/ref&gt; Active funds add to the risks inherent in investing in precious metals funds by introducing '''manager risk''', the chance that poor security selection  will cause the fund to underperform relevant benchmarks or other funds with a similar investment objective.&lt;ref group="note"&gt; The Vanguard Precious Metals &amp; Mining fund is not a suitable option for investing in precious metals equity. In 2004 Vanguard broadened the mandate of the Vanguard Precious Metals fund to include base metal and other materials mining stocks. (See [http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/734383/000093247104000488/specializedfundsfinal.txt 2004 Annual Report]). The move essentially ended the fund's applicability as an allocation in gold equity. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Exchange traded funds==
In the U.S. indexed portfolios containing gold and silver mining companies are offered by Van Eck Global (fund inception 05/16/06), Powershares (fund inception 09/18/2008), Global X (fund inception 11/03/2010) and [[Blackrock iShares]] (fund inception 01/31/2012).

Note that the  Global X Gold Explorers ETF and the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF track "junior" gold mining stock indexes. Junior gold mining stocks are small speculative companies that are engaged in finding gold deposits. If exploitable deposits are found, these deposits, or the company itself, is usually sold to an established "major" gold mining company.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.investopedia.com/articles/basics/12/beginners-guide-mining-stocks.asp A Beginner's Guide To Mining Stocks], investopedia, October 11 2012 &lt;/ref&gt;

Structured products are '''strongly not recommended''' for investors. They are targeted for those willing to accept a complete loss of principal, which does not align with investing for retirement. Read [{{{url|http://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=63695}}} Wiki - Structured Products] (forum thread) in its entirety for additional concerns, especially the [{{{url|http://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=881291#p881291}}} comment] by [[:Larry Swedroe]]. If you are considering these products, please ask in the forum for guidance.}}

'''Structured products ''' are securities derived from or based on a single security, a basket of securities, an index, a commodity, a debt issuance and/or a foreign currency.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;There is no standardized definition of a structured product in the federal securities laws.
SEC Rule 434 (Prospectus Delivery Requirements in Firm Commitment Underwritten Offerings of Securities for Cash) defines structured securities differently than the Pacific Exchange. (Refer to Footnote 1 in the NASD Guidance)&lt;/ref&gt; As the foregoing definition suggests, there are myriad types of structured products. Some structured products offer full protection of the principal invested, whereas others ''offer limited or no protection of the principal.''&lt;ref name="FINRA"&gt;[http://www.finra.org/web/groups/industry/@ip/@reg/@notice/documents/notices/p014997.pdf NASD Provides Guidance Concerning the Sale of Structured Products]&lt;/ref&gt;

Most structured products pay an interest or coupon rate substantially above the prevailing market rate. Structured products also ''frequently cap or limit the upside participation in the reference asset'', particularly if some principal protection is offered or if the security pays an above-market rate of interest.&lt;ref name="FINRA"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; (Refer to the graph [[:#Structured Notes | below]]).

Structured products, which are typically issued by investment banks or their affiliates, have a fixed maturity. Some, but not all, structured products may be listed on a national securities exchange. Moreover, even those structured products listed on a national securities exchange may be very thinly traded.&lt;ref name="FINRA"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Structured products typically have two components—a note and a derivative&lt;ref group="note"&gt;A security whose price is dependent upon or derived from one or more underlying assets. [http://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/derivative.asp Derivative], from Investopedia&lt;/ref&gt; (often an option). The note pays interest to the investor at a specified rate and interval. The derivative component establishes the payment at maturity. In some products, the derivative is, in effect, a put option sold by the investor that gives the issuer the right, but not the obligation, to sell the investor the reference security or securities at a predetermined price. In other products, the derivative is, in effect, a call option sold by the investor that gives the issuer the right, but not the obligation, to buy from the investor the reference security or securities at a predetermined price. ''Despite the derivative component of a structured product, they are often marketed to investors as debt securities.''&lt;ref name="FINRA"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rules and regulatory requirements==
Structured products are not specifically defined in the securities laws... Many involve innovative financing techniques creating customized financing and investment products to suit specific financial needs of customers. Such transactions may be ''structured'' for any number of reasons — for example, for principal protection, tax minimization, accounting cosmetics, monetization, or other specific purposes.&lt;ref name="SEC"&gt;[http://www.sec.gov/news/speech/2006/spch092006mag.htm Speech by SEC Staff:Structured Finance Activities: The Regulatory Viewpoint]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Sales of certain structured products have increasingly been targeted at retail customers.'' Therefore, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the self-regulatory organizations (SROs) are focusing attention on sales of structured products.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;As of July 16, 2010, the SEC is creating an office focused exclusively on disclosure reviews and policy-making for asset-backed securities and other structured finance products. [http://www.sec.gov/news/press/2010/2010-124.htm SEC Adds Units to Oversee Financial Institutions, Asset-Backed Securities, New Financial Products and Trends]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SEC"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

A broker-dealer that does business with a public customer makes an implied representation that it will deal fairly with the customer in accordance with industry standards. This gives rise to obligations under the U.S federal securities laws, including the obligation to recommend only specific securities or investment strategies suitable for the customer. Both the NASD and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), two key U.S. SROs, have suitability rules.&lt;ref name="SEC"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

(The referenced SEC speech&lt;ref name="SEC"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; contains an overview of detailed rules governing broker-dealer accountability, as well as SEC guidance on the potential liability of financial institutions for securities law violations arising from deceptive structured finance products and transactions.)

==Taxes==
Structured products may be considered contingent payment debt instruments for federal income tax purposes. This means you'll usually have to pay income taxes each year on imputed annual income even though you may not receive a cash payment until maturity. In addition, any gain realized upon the sale of these products may be treated as ordinary income.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fidelity.com/fixed-income-bonds/structured-products |title= Structured Products |website= |publisher= Fidelity Investments}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structured notes==
A structured note is an IOU&lt;ref group="note"&gt;"I Owe You", a legally binding agreement between a borrower and a lender. [http://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/iou.asp IOU], from Investopedia&lt;/ref&gt; from an investment bank that uses derivatives to create the desired exposure to one or more investments.&lt;ref name="beware"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these notes make no payments prior to maturity and are generally not callable prior to maturity. At maturity, the securities offer maturity payments which are based on the results of a stock market index, such as the S&amp;P 500, over the term of the note.&lt;ref&gt;[http://quantumonline.com/incomeinvestments.cfm#Special%20Products%20based%20on%20Market%20Indexes Income Investments], from [http://quantumonline.com/Index.cfm QuantumOnline.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

The only advantage of a structured note is to provide customized payouts and exposures. Disadvantages include:&lt;ref name="beware"&gt;[http://www.investopedia.com/articles/bonds/10/structured-notes.asp Structured Notes: Buyer Beware!], from Investopedia&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Credit Risk:'' You bear the risk that the investment bank forfeits on the debt. A structured note adds a layer of credit risk on top of market risk.
*''Liquidity Risk:'' Structured notes rarely trade after issuance and are very illiquid.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;A security that cannot easily be sold or exchanged for cash without a substantial loss in value. [http://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/illiquid.asp illiquid], from Investopedia&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Daily Pricing:'' Pricing accuracy is questionable because most structured notes never trade after issuance. Prices are usually calculated by a matrix, which is very different than [[:Net asset value | net asset value]].

The most common type of structured note is the Buffered Return-Enhanced Note (BREN). ''Buffered'' means it offers some but not complete downside protection. ''Return-Enhanced'' means it [[:Leverage | leverages]] market returns on the upside. The BREN is pitched as being ideal for investors forecasting a weak positive market performance but also worried about the market falling.&lt;ref name="beware"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' are marketable items produced to satisfy wants or needs. Economic commodities comprise goods and services.&lt;ref&gt;[[wikipedia:Commodity|Commodity]], on Wikipedia.&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of financial markets, commodities are raw materials that are traded on futures trading markets.  Examples include oil, crops and precious metals.

The primary purposes of commodities futures trading are:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commodityfuturescontract.asp. Commodities Futures Contract], Adam Hayes, Investopedia, {{date|3/28/2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Hedging -  locking in future commodity prices by farmers, industry and other parties. 
#Speculation - attempting to profit on commodity price movement by speculators. 

In terms of individual portfolio management, there are also [[mutual fund]]s and [[exchange-traded fund]]s (ETFs) that attempt to track and capture future price appreciation of commodities.

==Regulatory==
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is the federal government agency that regulates the commodity futures, commodity options, and swaps trading markets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cftc.gov/ConsumerProtection/Resources/index.htm Learning Resources - CFTC]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;A commodity is defined as:{{quotation|(1) A commodity, as defined in the Commodity Exchange Act, includes the agricultural commodities enumerated in Section 1a(9) of the Commodity Exchange Act, 7 USC 1a(9), and all other goods and articles, except onions as provided in Public Law 85-839 (7 USC 13-1), a 1958 law that banned futures trading in onions, and all services, rights, and interests in which contracts for future delivery are presently or in the future dealt in; (2) A physical commodity such as an agricultural product or a natural resource as opposed to a financial instrument such as a currency or interest rate.|[http://www.cftc.gov/ConsumerProtection/EducationCenter/CFTCGlossary/index.htm#C CFTC Glossary]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Commission was established as an independent agency in 1974, assuming responsibilities that had previously belonged to the Department of Agriculture since the 1920s. The Commission historically has been charged by the CEA with regulatory authority over the commodity futures markets. These markets have existed since the 1860s, beginning with agricultural commodities such as wheat, corn, and cotton.
 
Over time, these commodity futures markets, known as designated contract markets (DCMs) regulated by the Commission, have grown to include those for energy and metals commodities such as crude oil, heating oil, gasoline, copper, gold, and silver. The agency now also oversees DCMs for financial products such as interest rates, stock indexes, and foreign currency.

==Risks==

Direct trading of commodities via the futures markets tends to be very risky because commodity prices can be volatile. In addition leverage is typically used when speculating with financial futures.  Direct trading in commodity futures is not ordinarily a part of an individual investor's portfolio. 

Commodities investments via mutual funds and ETFs are comparatively safer and more appropriate for individual investors, but still come with material risks:
* Commodities have significant price volatility and can have positive or negative multi-year periods of return,&lt;ref&gt;[https://faculty.fuqua.duke.edu/~charvey/Research/Published_Papers/P124_Conquering_misperceptions_about.pdf Conquering Misconceptions about Commodity Futures Investing],Claude Erb and Campbell Harvey, Financial Analysts Journal, July/August  2016&lt;/ref&gt; but over the very long term tend to have low or no real inflation adjusted return.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2020/04/27/oil-and-commodity-prices-are-where-they-were-160-years-ago Commodity prices are where they are 160 years ago],The Economist, {{date|4/27/2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; By themselves their risk return relationship is not particularly attractive. 
* Commodity prices are often sensitive to economic cycles, and may experience price declines at the same time as stock/equity investments. 
* Commodities are traded via futures and do not exactly equal the current "spot" prices.  Thus returns on commodity based funds may have material variances in returns vs. popular commodity price indices. The causes of this are "contango" and "backwardation".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/documents/research/research-rethinking-commodities.pdf Rethinking Commodities ], by Fiona Boal and Jim Wiederhold, S&amp;P Dow Jones, January 2020 &lt;/ref&gt; These result due to rollover of futures contracts because individual investors do not want to take delivery of the actual commodities. 
* Commodity funds tend to have higher expense ratios than comparable stock and bond funds.
* Some commodity ETFs issue K-1 tax forms which can complicate and delay individuals annual tax return filings.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.etf.com/sections/features-and-news/k-1-taxes-hurdle-commodity-etfs K-1 Taxes Hurdle For Commodity ETFs ], by Lara Crigger, ETF.com, {{date|4/9/2018}} &lt;/ref&gt;

==Role in a portfolio==
Commodity spot prices, as an asset class, over the very long term, have not generated a significant real return. Commodity mutual funds and ETFs invest in futures contracts that derive excess returns over the risk free rate of return from two sources:
#Changes in futures prices
#The roll yield—which can be either positive or negative—that results from replacing an expiring contract with a further out contract in order to avoid physical delivery yet maintain positions in the futures markets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://corporate.morningstar.com/US/documents/Indexes/PuttingMomentumIntoCommodities.pdf Putting Momentum into Commodities], by Paul D. Kaplan, Morningstar, {{date|10/14/2011}} &lt;/ref&gt;

Some individual and institutional investors include commodities as part of their portfolio for purposes of diversification of returns and inflation protection.  Commodities do provide some level of protection against unexpected inflation. Protection against expected protection is more modest.&lt;ref&gt;[https://personal.vanguard.com/pdf/ISGCTIPS.pdf Commodities and short-term TIPS, how each combats unexpected inflation], Paul Bosse, CFA, Vanguard Research, June 2019&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Notice|
This is an advanced investing topic. Hedge funds are not recommended for retirement portfolios and should only be considered by experienced investors who are willing to accept a high level of risk (see [[#Investment risk| below]]). Please ask in the forum for advice.
}}

A '''hedge fund''' is an investment fund that can undertake a wider range of investment and trading activities than other funds, but which is only open for investment from particular types of investors specified by regulators. These investors are typically institutions, such as pension funds, university endowments and foundations, or high net worth individuals. As a class, hedge funds invest in a diverse range of assets, but they most commonly trade liquid securities on public markets. They also employ a wide variety of investment strategies, and make use of techniques such as [http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortselling.asp#axzz1h1IJLGX5 short selling] and [[Leverage | leverage]].&lt;ref name="WikiHF"&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedge_fund Hedge fund], from Wikipedia&lt;/ref&gt;

''Like'' [[Mutual fund|mutual funds]], hedge funds pool investors' money and invest those funds in financial instruments in an effort to make a positive return. Many hedge funds seek to profit in all kinds of markets by pursuing [[Leverage |leveraging]] and other speculative investment practices that may increase the risk of investment loss.&lt;ref name="SEChf"&gt;[http://www.sec.gov/answers/hedge.htm Hedging Your Bets: A Heads Up on Hedge Funds and Funds of Hedge Funds], from the [http://www.sec.gov/index.htm U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission] (SEC)&lt;/ref&gt;

''Unlike'' mutual funds, however, hedge funds are ''not'' required to register with the SEC. Hedge funds typically issue securities in “private offerings” that are not registered with the SEC under the Securities Act of 1933. In addition, hedge funds are not required to make periodic reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. But hedge funds are subject to the same prohibitions against fraud as are other market participants, and their managers have the same fiduciary duties as other investment advisers.&lt;ref name="SEChf" /&gt; (Superseded by the Dodd-Frank legislation, see [[#U. S. regulation | below]].)

Hedge fund investors do not receive all of the federal and state law protections that commonly apply to most registered investments. For example, you won't get the same level of disclosures from a hedge fund that you'll get from registered investments. Without the disclosures that the securities laws require for most registered investments, it can be quite difficult to verify representations you may receive from a hedge fund. You should also be aware that, while the SEC may conduct examinations of any hedge fund manager that is registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act, the SEC and other securities regulators generally have limited ability to check routinely on hedge fund activities.&lt;ref name="SEChf" /&gt;

Hedge funds are commonly classified as a unique asset class, much like commodities, private equity, and other “alternative” investments. Yet ''unlike'' other asset classes, hedge funds ''do not'' share unique structural characteristics (e.g., bonds represent a loan to a company or government agency, and stocks represent ownership in a corporation). Consequently, you should not think of hedge funds should as an alternative asset class, but rather as ''investment strategies'' that trade existing asset classes to generate returns.&lt;ref name ="VG"&gt;[https://institutional.vanguard.com/iip/pdf/hedgefunds_012005.pdf Understanding Alternative Investments: A Primer on Hedge Fund Evaluation] by Christopher B. Philips, Vanguard Investment Counseling &amp; Research (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strategies==
Hedge funds, in short, are largely unregulated, private pools of capital. Hedge fund managers can invest in a broad array of assets and pursue many investment strategies such as
''global macro'', ''market neutral equity'',&lt;ref name="Discrepancy"&gt;Wikipedia, Vanguard, and the NY Fed Report differ in this category. Directional, non-directional, and market neutral approaches are defined.&lt;/ref&gt; ''convertible arbitrage'', or ''event-driven''.&lt;ref name="FedNY"&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=995907 Hedge Funds, Financial Intermediation, and Systemic Risk], Kambhu, Stiroh, and Schuermann. Federal Reserve Bank of NY, August 1, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

These four categories are distinguished by investment style and have their own risk and return characteristics. Managed futures or multi-strategy funds may not fit into these categories, but are nonetheless popular strategies with investors. It is possible for hedge funds to commit to a certain strategy or employ multiple strategies to allow flexibility, for risk management purposes, or to achieve diversified returns. The hedge fund’s prospectus, also known as an offering memorandum, offers potential investors information about key aspects of the fund, including the fund's investment strategy, investment type, and leverage limit.&lt;ref name="WikiHF" /&gt;

Although no two funds or strategies are exactly alike, many funds operate within a common framework, namely using offsetting positions to control one or more identified risk factors. In fact, Alfred Winslow Jones formed the first hedge fund in 1949&lt;ref&gt;From [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedge_fund Wikipedia] (not in Vanguard publication): Sociologist, author, and financial journalist Alfred W. Jones is credited with coining the phrase "hedged fund", in contrast to prior nomenclatures, but is often erroneously credited with creating the first hedge fund structure in 1949.&lt;/ref&gt; - hedging long stock positions by shorting other positions - in order to mitigate the gyrations in the equity market. Jones’s model was based on the premise that performance depends more on stock selection than market direction. This practice of hedging market risk remains common in today’s hedge fund environment.&lt;ref name ="VG" /&gt;

== Characteristics ==
While strategies and individual hedge funds are quite heterogeneous, it is useful to focus on four broad characteristics that distinguish them from other types of money management funds.&lt;ref name="FedNY" /&gt;

First, hedge funds are not restricted by the type of trading strategies and financial instruments they may use. In particular, hedge funds can and do make use of short selling, derivatives, and options, all of which are complex and potentially nonlinear in payoffs.&lt;ref name="FedNY" /&gt;

Second, hedge funds make liberal use of leverage, be it directly through the use of debt or indirectly through leverage embedded in derivatives. This freedom is possible because hedge
funds in the United States largely fall outside of the regulatory umbrella by virtue of being open only to accredited investors and large institutions.&lt;ref name="FedNY" /&gt;

Hedge fund investors and counterparties impose some discipline on the amount of leverage actually employed. This discipline, however, may be limited by the third key characteristic - opacity to outsiders - which again is in large part due to their unregulated nature.&lt;ref name="FedNY" /&gt;

Finally, hedge fund managers are typically compensated based on both scale and absolute performance through a dual fee structure, e.g., the “2-and-20” set-up where managers retain 2% of the net asset value of the fund and 20% of returns above some benchmark.&lt;ref name="FedNY" /&gt;

=== Opacity ===
Opacity is not unique to hedge funds as financial institutions generally, and banks especially, are thought to be more opaque than firms in other industries. Financial firms,
however, often have traded instruments such as equity shares or bonds outstanding, so they are subjected to further scrutiny by market participants. By contrast, hedge funds, due to their
unregulated and private nature, are not subject to such wide scrutiny unless they chose to issue public securities. Moreover, the success of a hedge fund often depends on proprietary
trading strategies which, if made public, can be used by others to trade against them. Investors know this and are thus willing to tolerate a degree of opacity not seen in the mutual
fund industry in the hope of securing particularly rich returns.&lt;ref name="FedNY" /&gt;

==== U.S. regulation ====
Effective July 21, 2011 for all registered advisers, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act aims to increase regulation of financial companies, including hedge funds. The act requires advisers with private pools of capital exceeding $150 million or more in assets to register with the SEC as investment advisers and become subject to all rules which apply to registered advisers. Under Dodd-Frank, hedge fund managers who have less than $100 million in assets under management will be overseen by the state where the manager is domiciled and become subject to state regulation. This will significantly increase the number of hedge funds under state supervision, as the threshold for SEC regulation was previously $30 million.&lt;ref name="WikiHF" /&gt;

In response to Dodd-Frank, some of the larger hedge funds have gone entirely private; closing to outside investors and only trading their owner's money.&lt;ref&gt;One example is George Soros, discussed in [http://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=1254968#p1254968 Wiki Update - Hedge Funds], direct link to post.&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Compensation ===
The compensation structure of hedge funds differs markedly from other institutional investors such as mutual funds. In particular, hedge fund traders and managers tend to be compensated more on absolute return and scale, while their brethren in institutional investing typically have their compensation tied to performance relative to some benchmark
such as the S&amp;P 500. In addition, hedge fund managers have added optionality in the form of hurdle rates (no incentive fee if returns are below the hurdle rate) and high water marks
(incentive fee only on new profits, i.e., after past losses are made up), making payoffs potentially very convex and therefore asymmetric: gains and losses are treated differently. This convex payoff structure provides strong incentives for hedge fund managers to take on risk and leverage. Although incentive fees also play an important role in the mutual fund industry, they are required by law to be symmetric in the U.S.&lt;ref name="FedNY" /&gt;

== Investment risk ==
While in theory hedge funds enhance the risk-adjusted returns of traditional portfolios, they are also often acknowledged to be potentially risky investments. Because of their potential pitfalls, hedge funds should be viewed as long-term investments.&lt;ref name ="VG" /&gt;

Although "hedging" is actually the practice of attempting to reduce risk, the goal of most hedge funds is to maximize return on investment. Nowadays, hedge funds use dozens of different strategies, so it isn't accurate to say that hedge funds just "hedge risk". In fact, because hedge fund managers make speculative investments, these funds can carry ''more'' risk than the overall market.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hedgefund.asp Hedge Fund], from Investopedia&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, there is a growing amount of literature which substantiates conclusions that hedge fund returns are predominately determined by exposure to common risk factors, not manager skill. ''Investors seeking higher returns should avoid hedge funds, and gain access to the risk factors they want in lower cost ways, such as index or other low-cost, passively managed funds.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505123_162-57344189/the-way-to-predict-hedge-fund-returns/?tag=mncol;lst;1 The way to predict hedge fund returns], by [[Larry Swedroe]], CBSmoneywatch.com, 16-Dec-11&lt;/ref&gt;

'''{{PAGENAME}}''', for investment purposes, is usually held in the form of bullion coins or in a gold bullion [[exchange-traded fund]] (ETF). Gold company stocks can be held individually, or in a gold stocks [[mutual fund]] or ETF.

==Gold investments==

===Bullion coins===
Examples of popular bullion coins minted by the United States, Canada, and South Africa are illustrated below.

===Gold stocks and mutual funds===
* See [[Precious metals equity]] page which has different characteristics than gold bullion.

==Taxation==
Gold Bullion and gold bullion ETFs are subject to the maximum 28% capital gains tax on collectibles. This tax rate is higher than the maximum capital gains tax  of 15% on other investment assets. However, in some cases, such as with GTU, gains can be taxed as capital gains because the investment can be treated as a [[passive foreign investment company]] (PFIC) - see a tax adviser for details.

==Gold prices==
Before 1968, the price of gold was relatively stable, with few major fluctuations. From 1968-1978 fundamental changes were made to the global monetary system and gold's treatment in the United States, potentially changing gold's role as an asset class.&lt;ref name="suggestion"&gt;{{Forum post|title = Re: Suggestions for the Wiki|p = 4878884|author = pepys| date = Dec 08, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968, the "gold pool" system, where central banks traded on the private market to control the price of gold, was ended, resulting in the price of gold diverging from the official price. The United States stopped allowing the convertibility of the dollar to gold in 1971 and officially ended it in 1973.&lt;ref name="suggestion" /&gt;

Gold was re-legalized for Americans to own and trade in 1975. In 1978, the official price of gold was finally removed. During and after these changes, the real price of gold has been highly volatile.&lt;ref name="suggestion" /&gt;

The following table provides annual gold prices (including high and low prices) starting in 1970.

{{Warning|Master limited partnerships are intended for very experienced investors who understand both the risks involved and the incredibly complex taxation rules. Please ask in the [https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/index.php Bogleheads forum] for advice, as these securities are intended for high net worth individuals with the resources to manage these securities.}}

A '''master limited partnership''' (MLP) is a [[Wikipedia:limited partnership|limited partnership]] that is publicly traded on a securities exchange. It combines the tax benefits of a limited partnership with the liquidity of publicly traded securities.

The '''master limited partnership''' is actually a colloquial name for a subset of the group of entities called publicly traded partnerships (PTPs). PTPs issue publicly traded interests (called “units”) that are accessible to investors with a brokerage account.&lt;ref name="VG"&gt;{{cite web| author=David T. Kwon| url=https://advisors.vanguard.com/VGApp/iip/site/advisor/researchcommentary/article/IWE_InvResPrimerLtdPartnerships| title=User's guide to master limited partnerships| publisher=Vanguard Institutional| date=June 17, 2014}}{{dead link}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, PTPs are unincorporated entities under state law, like limited liability companies or limited partnerships, and are treated as partnerships for tax purposes. As partnerships, PTPs are able to pass through all income, gains, deductions, losses, and credits to investors, and they generally pay no entity-level taxes.&lt;ref name="VG" /&gt;

==Characteristics==
'''MLP units carry stock-like risk:''' The publicly traded units issued by MLPs —the predominant way investors gain exposure to them- represent the equity capital of a business, and as such, carry a level of risk similar to that of stock in a capital structure. In other words, MLP units are inherently riskier than bonds issued by the same company.&lt;ref name="VG" /&gt; 

'''MLPs are concentrated in the energy sector:''' Most MLPs are energy-related businesses. This is a result of tax-related legislation.&lt;ref name="VG" /&gt;

==Investing in MLPs==
There are two ways to invest in MLPs:

*'''Direct investment:''' Investors purchase units of one or more MLPs, thus becoming a partner in each business. A key advantage of direct investing is pass-through taxation. As partnerships, MLPs generally pay no corporate taxes; instead, they pass through net income and gains untaxed to investors, who then pay personal income tax on their share of these proceeds.&lt;ref name="VG" /&gt;
*'''Indirect investment:'''  Investing indirectly means gaining exposure to MLPs through investment vehicles that hold or track them. Such vehicles include closed-end funds, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and exchange-traded notes (ETNs). In addition to diversification, key advantages these vehicles provide are that they eliminate the need to deal with Schedule K-1s and do not generate [http://www.irs.gov/publications/p598/ch04.html Unrelated Business Taxable Income] (UBTI).&lt;ref name="VG" /&gt;

==Taxation==
MLPs require you to understand six tax topics:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/baldwin/2010/12/02/tax-guide-to-master-limited-partnerships/| title=Tax Guide To Master Limited Partnerships| publisher=Forbes| date=December 2, 2010| accessdate=September 17, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Flow-through accounting
#Tax basis
#Return of capital
#Passive loss rules
#Recapture
#Zero basis

An MLP's tax pass-through status applies at both a federal and a state level. An MLP unitholder is responsible for paying state income taxes on the portion of income allocated to the unitholder for each individual state in which the MLP operates. For companies that have networks of pipelines reaching across America, this can mean a considerable number of additional filings for the investor. In most cases, however, unless the unitholder owns a large position, the share of allocated income is small and the unitholder may not have to file in some states due to minimum income limits. Additionally, some states, such as Texas and Wyoming, do not have state income taxes.&lt;ref name="Alerian"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://etfdb.com/index-education/mlp-101/| title=MLP 101| publisher=VettaFi| accessdate=September 17, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If you are considering owning an MLP in a tax-advantaged account such as an IRA, partnership income (not cash distributions) may be considered unrelated business taxable income (UBTI) and subject to unrelated business income tax (UBIT), if UBIT exceeds $1,000 in a year. The custodian of the IRA is responsible for filing IRS Form 990T and paying the taxes.&lt;ref name="Alerian" /&gt;

{{Expand article|further=no}}
'''Peer-to-peer (P2P) lending''' is a collaborative way for individual investors to participate in lending activities previously limited to banks. The information in this article is oriented toward the two major U.S. companies providing mature lending platforms, Lending Club and Prosper.

== Summary ==
Below&lt;ref&gt;Lending Club Company Website [https://www.lendingclub.com/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Prosper.com Company Website [https://www.prosper.com/]&lt;/ref&gt; summarizes some of the key aspects of P2P:
* The P2P companies screen borrowers according to stringent lending standards but can provide loans more efficiently than banks.&lt;ref&gt;Why Wells Fargo is Terrified of Peer to Peer Lending [http://www.lendingmemo.com/wells-fargo-peer-to-peer-lending/] &lt;/ref&gt;
* Accurate risk ratings with associated interest rates are posted for investors.&lt;ref&gt;How Lending Club Sets Interest Rates [https://www.lendingclub.com/public/how-we-set-interest-rates.action]&lt;/ref&gt;  
* The P2P company issues “notes” to individual investors, who can invest small amounts (as little as $25 each) to diversify across hundreds of loans, and investors are charged fees of 0.5% to 1% of the note’s value, which are deducted as principal and interest are paid.  
* Notes are available in two term periods, 36 months and 60 months.  
* P2P companies recommend holding at least 200 notes to obtain adequate diversification.  
* P2P lending is regulated at the state level, and not all states permit investment.  Some states limit investment only to Lending Club or to Prosper. Some states that prohibit investment permit purchase and sale of secondary market notes.

== Risks ==
* Default Risk – Notes issued are unsecured loans and borrowers default more frequently.
* Single Party Risk – The P2P companies own the loans, issue notes to investors, then collect and disburse payments of principal and interest. Investors do not own the underlying loans.  Therefore, in the event of a P2P company bankruptcy, the loans may be considered assets to the company’s creditors.  Accordingly, investors should carefully consider the limits to investor protections for Lending Club and Prosper before investing.
* Interest Rate Risk – When interest rates go up, the market value of existing notes will fall in price because new notes can be found at interest rates more attractive than existing (lower interest rate) notes.  
* Economic Risk – During poor economic conditions, and particularly during periods of high unemployment, default rates for notes could increase substantially.
* Liquidity Risk – Although there is a secondary market for trading P2P notes, market prices can decline significantly due to a lack of willing and available buyers.  Investors holding notes to maturity do not incur this risk.
*Prepayment Risk - Borrowers may pay back loans early, so lenders reinvesting the proceeds may obtain less favorable rates. Additionally, Lending Club investors incur a pre-payment penalty because they are still assessed the 1% fee against the balance of their "pro rata share of the payment."&lt;ref&gt;Lending Club Pre-payment Penalty to Investors [http://kb.lendingclub.com/investor/articles/Investor/What-happens-if-a-loan-is-repaid-early/?l=en_US&amp;c=Investor%3APayments_and_Fees&amp;fs=Search&amp;pn=1]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Competition from Institutions and Individuals – The available pool of attractive-rate notes has declined in recent years due to increased involvement by institutional and retail investors.  While the number of P2P loans is increasing, investor demand has been greater.  Accordingly, the average interest rate earned and number of loans available per retail investor have been declining since 2013.&lt;ref&gt;Is Peer-to-Peer Lending Over? [http://thecollegeinvestor.com/10812/is-peer-to-peer-lending-over/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.lendingclub.com/info/demand-and-credit-profile.action Lending Club Average Interest Rate]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Benefits ==
* The personal loan segment is a recently-available segment for retail investors, and provides a new way to add diversification within a fixed income portfolio.
* Investors who wish to actively manage their fixed income investments can now do so with P2P notes, even with limited capital.
* Given the small minimum investment per note ($25), a high level of loan diversification can be obtained.
* While lending standards were initially loose for P2P platforms, today they are more stringent. Additionally, P2P providers update their performance records, including loan default rates and returns, on a regular basis.
* You can filter loans by criteria that you choose, so you can “personalize” the risk characteristics for each individual loan you select. You can also select groups of notes that fit the amount of overall risk and return you prefer.
* Personal loans, while risky, provide a high return and different risks than other fixed income investments.  For example, personal loan notes are different than high yield corporate notes.
* Some investors may find it fun to select the individual loans they wish to participate in, and cherry-pick certain loans to attempt “better returns.” There are differences to be found, even between identically graded loans.

== Implications for investors ==
P2P is neither a simple nor a low cost investment, and therefore is considered inappropriate by most Boglehead investors. Bogleheads generally "take risk on the equity side" rather than with fixed income.

While the personal loan segment is a lucrative area previously limited to banks, it is not clear whether the risk adjusted return, ''after fees'', provides a better risk-adjusted return than comparable investments, such as high yield bonds. P2P should be considered a concentrated investment because of its single party risk. If selected, total investment in P2P should only be a small part of the portfolio (no more than 5%).  P2P is not tax-efficient and should be located within tax-advantaged accounts. P2P providers permit IRA accounts.

Investors who might consider P2P useful could be those already including high yield (junk) bonds in their portfolio. The reason is P2P may provide high yield investors additional diversification. P2P and high yield investors should take a corresponding reduction in their equity allocation, since both have a high correlation with equity performance.  It is suggested that a high number of P2P notes be held (700-800) for effective diversification, and that maturities for every note be for terms of 36 months, no 60-month term notes included.  A best practice for active investors is to acquire notes gradually, over a 36-month period, so a ladder with a portion maturing every month can be reinvested at current rates.

The Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA), or "'''{{PAGENAME}}'''" is a government-sponsored enterprise (GSE) whose purpose is to facilitate capital allocation in the residential real estate market. Fannie Mae operates in the secondary mortgage market, expanding the real estate financing market by securitizing residential mortgages into [[Mortgage Backed Securities |mortgage-backed securities]]. The firm raises capital by issuing bonds.

Fannie Mae was established as a federal agency in 1938, and was chartered by Congress in 1968 as a private shareholder-owned company. On September 6, 2008, the company was placed in conservatorship by the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.fanniemae.com/about-us/corporate-governance/fannie-mae-board-committees| title=Fannie Mae Board Committees| publisher=Fannie Mae| accessdate=September 3, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under conservatorship, shareholders were wiped out (the stock dividend suspended, the stock delisted, and falling to less than a dollar), while the value of Fannie Mae bonds and mortgage-backed securities were backed by the government.

For investors, Fannie Mae securities come in three forms:

* '''Stock''': Since 1968, Fannie Mae has been a public stock, listed on the NYSE until effective bankruptcy in 2008 forced the government to place the company into conservatorship. The company currently trades in the over the counter market.
*''' Bond''': Fannie Mae bonds are considered [[Government agency bonds |government agency (GSE) debentures]]. Fannie Mae issues benchmark bills®, benchmark notes®, callable medium-term notes, discount notes, subordinated debt, and other debt products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.fanniemae.com/about-us/what-we-do| title=What We Do| publisher=Fannie Mae| accessdate=September 3, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''' Mortgage-backed securities (MBS)''': Fannie Mae issues pools of mortgages, packaged into Fannie Mae MBS, on which Fannie Mae guarantees timely payment of principal and interest.

Geographically, REIT and real estate securities markets are spread across the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia.&lt;ref name= "Global REIT Chronology"&gt;[http://www.reit.com/Investing/GlobalRealEstateInvesting.aspx Global REIT Chronology], REIT.com &lt;/ref&gt; For a U.S. domiciled investor, '''international REITS''' make up the global market ex U.S securities.

Nations finalizing the adoption of REIT structures since 2010 include Spain, Finland, Hungary, Israel, Dubai, South Africa, Pakistan, Philippines, and Mexico.]]

The United States, in 1960, was the first country to institute the REIT structure for holding commercial real estate. Australia created its REIT structure in 1971. Beginning in 2000 an increasing number of nations have legislated REIT structures.  In international markets, especially emerging markets, a frequent vehicle for investing in commercial real estate is a Real Estate Operating Company (REOC). Whereas a REIT distributes earnings to shareholders, a REOC reinvests earnings into the business.&lt;ref name="Vanguard Institutional"&gt;[https://institutional.vanguard.com/VGApp/iip/site/institutional/researchcommentary/article/CommercialEquityREAnalysis REITs: Effective exposure to commercial real estate?], Vanguard Institutional, 03/23/2011&lt;/ref&gt;  The table below provides a listing of nations now employing REIT structures for securitized real estate investment.

==Role of international REITs in an investment portfolio==
For portfolios that include an allocation to domestic real estate securities, the arguments for inclusion of international reits include:
* Diversifying the risk of a single domestic real estate market by accessing a wider universe of real estate companies. This argument is similar to the basic argument for [[Domestic/International|adding international stocks to a domestic stock portfolio]]. For U.S. investors, domestic real estate securities provide access to about one third of the global real estate markets.
* International real estate markets exhibit lower correlations between regions, thus offering a potential diversification benefit.  Vanguard research indicates that  the rolling annual correlation between international reits and US reits (1990-2010, measured by S&amp;P indexes) ranges from -0.4 to 0.85.&lt;ref name="Vanguard Institutional"/&gt; International reits also provide varying correlations with US stocks, US bonds, US cash, and international securities markets.
* Wilshire argues that target retirement funds employing global real estate allocations should allocate between 7% to 15% of the portfolio to a global real estate index fund.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epra.com/media/Wilshire-Target-Date-Fund-White-Paper-2012.pdf The Role of REITs and Listed Real Estate Equities in Target Date Fund Asset Allocations], Wilshire Associates, March 2012 &lt;/ref&gt;

Caveats regarding using an international REIT fund include the following.
* If you are a total market investor, the international total market index funds hold the market capitalization of international real estate securities.
* An international REIT fund creates an [[Principles of Tax-Efficient Fund Placement|asset location]] issue due to the fact that international reits have comparatively high dividend distribution that is mostly taxed at [[Marginal tax rate|marginal income tax rates]]. The expected high distributions, mostly [[Non-qualified dividends|non-qualified]], suggest that international REITs are candidates for placement in [[Traditional IRA|tax-deferred]] or [[Roth IRA|tax-free]] investment accounts. However, to the extent that income is taxed by local national governments, the fund's dividend distribution may qualify for a [[foreign tax credit]], which is foregone if the fund is held in a tax-advantaged account. In sum, most foreign REIT index funds and ETFs have a foreign tax credit of only 5% of the dividend yield (see, for example, [https://advisors.vanguard.com/VGApp/iip/site/advisor/investments/taxcenter/foreigntaxcredit Vanguard Foreign Tax worksheets] for Vanguard's fund); therefore, the high tax rate is the more important cost factor and the funds are better held in tax-advantaged accounts.

'''{{PAGENAME}}s''' were created from a law that Congress enacted in 1960&lt;ref group="note"&gt; Additional major legislative changes to REITs since 1960 include the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (TRA), which eliminated the tax benefits of real estate limited partnerships and launched the modern era of equity REITS; the IRS private letter ruling on the Taubman Centers Inc. initial public offering (IPO) in 1992, which allowed for the tax free exchange of partnership real property to a REIT (known as an UPREIT); the Omnibus Budget and Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA), and the REIT Modernization Act of 1999 (RMA). See Feng, Zhilan, Price, S. McKay and Sirmans, C. F., ''An Overview of Equity Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs): 1993-2009'' (March 8, 2011). Journal of Real Estate Literature, Vol. 19, No. 2, pp. 307-343, 2011. Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=1743132&lt;/ref&gt; to enable small investors to invest in real estate without either the large capital required to purchase single properties, or the responsibilities of property maintenance on a direct realty purchase. When holding shares of an equity REIT, an investor is an actual owner of the underlying real estate. 

REITs receive special tax treatment--the deduction of dividend payments on their corporate income taxes-- as long as the primary purpose of the company is to own real estate and it pays out 90% of its dividend income (rental income or mortgage interest) each year to shareholders. The special tax treatment REIT dividends receive means that they are deemed non-qualified dividends for the investor (that is, not subject to the lower "qualified" dividend tax rate granted to firms subject to double taxation). This makes REITs very tax-inefficient, and best held in tax-advantaged accounts.&lt;ref group= "note"&gt; Since 1972, the inception of the NAREIT Equity Index, the composition of equity REITs total return has consisted of 60% income return and 40% capital gain return. See also, [http://www.reit.com/REIT101/REITAttributes/Dividends.aspx Income history], Reit.com &lt;/ref&gt; 

If an investor has filled up available tax-advantaged space with bonds and wants to invest in REITs, placing them in a low-cost [[Variable Annuity |variable annuity]] or a [[Non-deductible traditional IRA|non-deductible traditional IRA]] is usually more tax efficient than holding them in a taxable account. Alternately, an investor can also switch taxable bonds held in tax-advantaged accounts for REIT held in tax-advantaged and adding [[Municipal bonds | municipal bonds]] held in taxable accounts.

==Types of REITs==
REITs are typically characterized by the nature of the assets the company holds: real estate, mortgages, or a combination of the two. 
* '''Equity REITs''': own physical real estate and are traded on a public stock exchange. This makes REITs very liquid unlike owning real estate directly. Equity REITS make up over 80% of the U.S. REIT market,&lt;ref&gt; Feng, Zhilan, Price, S. McKay and Sirmans, C. F., ''An Overview of Equity Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs): 1993-2009'' (March 8, 2011). Journal of Real Estate Literature, Vol. 19, No. 2, pp. 307-343, 2011. Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=1743132&lt;/ref&gt; and include the following sectors:
:* Diversified REITs: own a diverse group of properties not tied to any specific sector or industry.
:* Industrial REITs: own industrial real estate, that is, used for industry manufacturing.
:* Office REITs: REITs that own office buildings or other similar property.
:* Residential REITs: REITs that invest in residential real estate, such as apartment complexes.
:* Retail REITs: REITs that invest primarily in retail properties such as shopping malls.
:* Specialized REITs: own property that is specialized in a single use (such as lodging or storage).
* '''Mortgage REITs''': Invest primarily in mortgages backed by commercial real estate, and the earnings are from the mortgage loans.&lt;ref group="note"&gt; [{{Vf | 0123}} Vanguard REIT Index Fund] does not invest in mortgage REITs since they are not part of the MSCI REIT index. &lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Hybrid REITs''': REITs that invest in both property ownership and mortgages.
* '''Private REITs''': Private (non-traded) REITs are not traded on a public stock exchange, and are very illiquid. These are often sold by financial advisors who receive large commissions, an indication that they are not looking out for your best interest, and are designed to be sold and not bought.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reitwrecks.com/2009/05/non-traded-reits-are-designed-to-be.html Non-Traded REITs Are Designed to be Sold, Not Bought], REIT Wrecks&lt;/ref&gt;

==Valuation of REITs==
REITs are typically valued using two factors: yield, and premium (discount) to [[Net asset value | NAV]].

===Dividend yield===
A REIT's yield&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The income return on an investment. This refers to the interest or dividends received from a security and is usually expressed annually as a percentage. See: [http://www.investopedia.com/terms/y/yield.asp Yield Definition on Investopedia]&lt;/ref&gt; is calculated exactly as stocks and is expressed as an amount of dividends (in percent) a REIT will pay investors.

:&lt;math&gt;\mbox{Dividend yield}=\frac{\mbox{dividend per share}}{\mbox{price per share}}&lt;/math&gt;

Unlike a bond's [[Bond yield#Yield to maturity | Yield-to-Maturity]] (YTM), there is no presumption that capital, i.e. NAV, will be returned to investors in that equation (the redemption of a bond).

With common stocks, company boards decide how much of ''Earnings Per Share'' are to be paid out as ''Dividends Per Share''. This can cover a large range, as many pay no dividends at all, but ''Dividends Per Share'' may typically range from 1.5 to 3 times ''Earnings Per Share''.

With REITs, Earnings Per Share are ''not'' an accurate measure of a REIT's performance. Investment analysts usually use an adjustment to earnings known as ''Funds From Operations (FFO)''&lt;ref group="note"&gt; ''Funds From Operations'' adjusts earnings by adding back such significant non-cash elements on the balance sheet as real estate depreciation and other amortization, and subtracting capital gains or adding capital losses from sales of real estate. See [http://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fundsfromoperation.asp Funds From Operations - FFO], investopedia. A further adjustment, known as ''Adjusted Funds From Operations (AFFO)'' is often made to FFO. The most common adjustments are for regular expenditures used to maintain or improve a REIT's properties. See [http://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/affo.asp Adjusted Funds From Operations (AFFO)], Investopedia. Over the 1993 - 2009 period, U.S equity REITs provided an average 10.00% Funds From Operations yield, compared to 4.16% Earnings Per Share yield. Over the same period, equity REITS provided an average dividend payout ratio (Dividends/Net Income) of 131.48%. See See Feng, Zhilan, Price, S. McKay and Sirmans, C. F., ''An Overview of Equity Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs): 1993-2009'' (March 8, 2011). Journal of Real Estate Literature, Vol. 19, No. 2, pp. 307-343, 2011. Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=1743132. &lt;br&gt; In terms of dividend yield, Vanguard research reports that the FTSE NAREIT index provided an average 6.70% dividend yield over the 1989 - 2008 period, which is consistent with the 1993 - 2009 index return (6.70% average yield) derived from index data available for download at [http://www.reit.com/DataAndResearch/IndexData/FNUS-Historical-Data.aspx NAREIT]. See [https://institutional.vanguard.com/iam/pdf/ICRREI.pdf?cbdForceDomain=false Commercial Equity Real Estate: A Framework for Analysis] by Christopher B. Philips, CFA, Vanguard Investment Counseling &amp; Research, 08/17/2007. &lt;/ref&gt; as a more accurate measure of an equity REIT's profitability and capacity to pay dividends.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.investopedia.com/articles/04/112204.asp How To Assess A Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT)], investopedia. &lt;/ref&gt; 

US tax laws require essentially a payout of 90% of GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principle) taxable income, so "adjusted" ''Earnings Per Share'' and ''Dividends Per Share'' are closely aligned. Therefore, it is appropriate to value the REIT on a dividend yield basis.

For example: A REIT has a share price of $100. The total dividend for the REIT is expected to be $3.00 over the next 12 months. The REIT is therefore said to be trading at a prospective dividend yield of 3/100 or 3%.

===Average premium (discount) to NAV===
A REIT's Net Asset Value is calculated as:

:&lt;math&gt;\mbox{NAV per share}=\frac{\mbox{gross value of buildings}-\mbox{debt}}{\mbox{number of shares}}&lt;/math&gt;

Debt is taken deducting any cash that is on the REIT balance sheet.&lt;ref group="note"&gt; Over the 1993 - 2009 period, the leverage ratio (long-term liabilities divided by total assets) for U.S equity REITS averaged 44.37%. The annual average leverage ratio has ranged from a low of 29.96% in 1993 to a high of 51.31% in 2008, and has generally risen over the measurement period. See See Feng, Zhilan, Price, S. McKay and Sirmans, C. F., ''An Overview of Equity Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs): 1993-2009'' (March 8, 2011). Journal of Real Estate Literature, Vol. 19, No. 2, pp. 307-343, 2011. Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=1743132 &lt;/ref&gt;

The quoted price of a REIT, which trades like any stock, can differ from NAV. Historically, when the market is bullish about future commercial real estate values, stocks move to a premium to NAV. This is also true if there is a lot of takeover activity in the REIT sector. In essence, investors are expecting NAVs to rise. The discounts are quite analogous to [[Closed End Funds|closed end funds]], which normally trade at a discount to the value of their underlying investments.

Green Street Advisers publishes graphs showing estimated average premium (discount) to NAV.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;[http://www.greenstreetadvisors.com/ Green Street Advisers]. This link does not represent an endorsement, but this approach seems like a useful way to think about REIT valuation.

Average Premium to NAV: The premium (discount) ascribed to a company’s net asset value that is implied by the current share price compared to Green Street’s assessment of net asset value. Observed premiums/discounts in the public market have historically been reliable predictors of future changes in private-market prices.&lt;/ref&gt; The premium (discount) to NAV has ranged from over 30% premium to 40% discount over time.

===Expected returns from REITs===

[[William Bernstein]] has proposed a simple model for estimating long term returns for equity REITS. The sources of return for a REIT are:

* The current dividend yield,&lt;ref group="note"&gt; The dividend yield, is based on the payout of Funds from Operation minus the costs of maintaining property. Ruff in his paper "Commercial Real Estate: New Paradigm or Old Story, applies this metric to direct investment in real property, where it is referred to as the Cap rate, which is the net cap rate minus the expense cap rate, which is assumed to average 2%. &lt;/ref&gt; ( in our example above $3.00 per share).
* Any future growth in dividends. William Bernstein has shown that these grow by less than GDP.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.efficientfrontier.com/ef/702/2percent.htm The Two-Percent Dilution], ''Efficient Frontier'', 2002. &lt;/ref&gt; For REITS, rental income growth is usually assumed to roughly equal the inflation rate.
* The change in valuation of the REITs, or ‘speculative return’.

As an example, if REITs are currently yielding 3% and we expect future dividend growth of 3% per annum (i.e. slightly ahead of inflation), then expected long term returns are = 3% + 3% + change in valuation.

====Speculative return====
The following example illustrates the role of speculative return in the valuation model.

In our example above, the REIT has a share price of $100 and pays $3.00 dividends per annum. Our assumed yield on REITs (c. 3%) is very low compared to historic ranges. A pessimist might argue REITs will eventually return to say a 6% yield, implying a halving of valuation. If this revaluation took place over 18 years, the expected return of REITs in the formula above = 3% + 3% - 4% = 2% per annum. 

In other words, in 18 years, our REIT would have dividends of $5.11 (x 1.03^18), a price of $85.12 (5.11/ 6% yield), but the investor would also have received the dividends paid out in that time period, giving a positive total return despite the fall in valuation.

Note that in this model, because a yield is a per cent rather than a times (‘x’) like PE, a ''rise'' in yields is a fall in valuation, while a ''fall'' in yields is a rise in valuation.

The most important thing to observe both about premium/ discount to NAV and yield, for REITs, is that it is anything but stable. Even the long term average may not be that helpful, because real estate tends to have long cycles and the reversion to mean from a high or low takes so long.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;"Commercial Real Estate (CRE) tends to have a long cycle, typically over 10 years, and the booms and busts are spectacular. The CRE bust in New England in the early 1990s brought down at least one bank ([[Wikipedia:Bank of New England|Bank of New England, wikipedia]]) and left empty office buildings dotting the area for years. Something similar happened in Toronto at the same time. In London, the bankruptcy of the Canadian developer [[Wikipedia:Olympia and York|Olympia and York, wikipedia]], the owner of the Canary Wharf supercomplex, left Barclays Bank in possession of 10 per cent. of the UK’s entire office space Similar patterns were seen in western US states during the S&amp;L Crisis of the early 1990s. Before that, Calgary and Houston were particularly badly hit in the early 1980s when oil prices fell. There were office buildings built in Calgary in 1980 that were still empty in 1992." from ''Valuation of REITS'', unpublished document, by forum member Valuethinker.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dividend composition==
REIT dividends are composed of three different types of yield income, which are taxed at different rates:
* '''Return of Capital''': This is a return of your own investment and is not taxed upon distribution, it reduces your cost basis by the amount of the dividend.
* '''Capital Gain''': Results from sale of properties or other assets, taxed at either short or long term capital gains rates.
* '''Dividend''': Income which usually results from rental income of properties, which is non-qualified and taxed at your full marginal tax rate.&lt;ref&gt; See [{{Vf | 0123}} Current REIT index fund yield estimate], for the current yield of the Vanguard REIT index fund. &lt;/ref&gt;

The exact breakdown of the REIT fund dividends are not known until after the calendar year, sometimes as late as late February or early March. Beware of this if you hold REIT in a taxable account.&lt;ref group="note"&gt; For example, Vanguard provides a current estimate of unadjusted yield, and adjusted yield accounting for the return of capital on their [{{Vf | 0123}} Current REIT index fund yield estimate] page. They do not quote a 30-day SEC yield for the fund due to these complications. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Risks==

===Interest rate risk===
REIT prices may decline as the interest rate rises.

===Sector risk===
Equity REITs are one specific sector of the stock market; as of 2016, there are 151 stocks in the MSCI REIT index.&lt;ref&gt; [{{Vf | 0123}} Vanguard REIT Index Fund - Portfolio]&lt;/ref&gt; This makes REITs more volatile than broad market index funds. Some suggest that public REITs represent only a small slice of the commercial real estate market, and are best referred to as a separate asset class rather than a sector.&lt;ref group="note"&gt; Whether equity REITS act as a suitable proxy for direct investment in commercial real estate is an unsettled question in academic finance. Among recent papers, Hoesli, Martin and Oikarinen, Elias, ''Are REITs Real Estate? Evidence from International Sector Level Data'' (March 1, 2012). Swiss Finance Institute Research Paper No. 12-15. Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=2034377 or http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2034377, concludes: &lt;br&gt; "Both the variance decompositions and impulse responses suggest that the long-run REIT market performance is much more closely related to the direct real estate market than to the general stock market. Consequently, REITs and direct real estate should be relatively good substitutes in a long-horizon investment portfolio." &lt;br&gt;On the other hand, Pavlov, Andrey D. and Wachter, Susan M.,'' REITS and Underlying Real Estate Markets: Is There a Link?'' (June 27, 2011). U of Penn, Inst for Law &amp; Econ Research Paper No. 11-20. Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=1879968 or http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.1879968 finds: &lt;br&gt; "a statistically significant relationship between REIT and real estate returns only in the office sector. Other property types offer only very weak and insignificant relationships. This finding suggests that direct real estate investment or investment through the property price index derivatives cannot be replicated using REITs." &lt;/ref&gt;

==Returns==
The NAREIT Equity Index provides the longest term history of U.S equity REITs, covering the period from 1972 to the present. Over this period, equity REIT's annual return ranged between a high of +47.59% in 1976 and a low of -37.73% in 2008.

The 1973 - 1974 bear market in REIT stocks was predominantly marked by the negative performance of mortgage REITs which made up the majority of REIT issues during this era. These mortgage REITs had a large number of holdings in real estate building and development loans, many of which defaulted in the recessionary economic environment.&lt;ref&gt; [https://www.aier.org/sites/default/files/publications/RR19740902.pdf Research Reports: Real Estate Investment Trusts], American Institute for Economic Research, November 2, 1974. &lt;/ref&gt; The NAREIT Mortgage REIT indexed declined -36.26% in 1973, and dropped -45.32% in 1974.

After the 1973 - 1974 bear market equity REITs remained a small portion of the overall equity market. In 1975 the market consisted of 12 equity REITs with a market capitalization of 275.7 million dollars. Tax changes in 1987 and 1992 set the stage for a steady increase in both the number of equity REITs and the market capitalization of the REIT market.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.reit.com/DataAndResearch/US-REIT-Industry-MarketCap.aspx Historical REIT Industry Market Capitalization:], REIT.com &lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, with the maturation of the equity REIT market, Vanguard introduced an equity REIT index fund, tracking the MSCI US REIT Index. 

Most equity REIT market declines have historically preceded or been coincident with economic recessions. The NAREIT Index declined in the 1989 - 1990 recession;&lt;ref&gt; [[Wikipedia:Early 1990s recession in the United States|Early 1990s recession in the United States]] &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.fdic.gov/bank/historical/s&amp;l/ The S&amp;L Crisis: A Chrono-Bibliography],FDIC &lt;/ref&gt; declined again in the 1998 - 1999 bear market&lt;ref&gt; Clayton, Jim F. and MacKinnon, Greg H., Explaining the Discount to NAV in REIT Pricing: Noise or Information? (December 18, 2000). Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=258268 or http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.258268 &lt;/ref&gt; in advance of the 2000 - 2002 overall U.S. market decline (during which equity REITs provided positive returns); and declined once again in 2007 - 2008, the beginning stages of the 2008 - 2009 recession.&lt;ref&gt; [[Wikipedia:Great Recession in the United States|Great Recession in the United States]] &lt;/ref&gt;

==Role in a portfolio==
[[File:Reit correlation.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Source:[http://www.reit.com/InstitutionalInvestors/Diversification.aspx REIT.com]]]
Most Bogleheads allocate REITs up to 10% of their total portfolio according to a [http://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=219&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;vote=viewresult forum poll]. David Swensen, CIO of Yale University and author of [[Special:BookSources/978-0-7432-2838-1|''Unconventional Success'']] suggests a 20% allocation to equity REITs in his [[Lazy Portfolios#David Swensen's lazy portfolio |model portfolio]] for individual investors.

REITs, due to the risks involved, should be treated as equity even though they have income-producing characteristics similar to bonds. 

REITs can act as a portfolio diversifier since they have varying correlation to stocks and bonds (either higher or lower).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.portfoliosolutions.com/assets/attachments/2006_3_c.pdf By the Numbers: Asset Correlations, Fall 2006, Portfolio Solutions] &lt;/ref&gt; REITs are weakly correlated to inflation, due to the hard asset/rental income nature of the investment,&lt;ref&gt; [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=927712 Cointegration of Real Estate Stocks and REITs with Common Stocks, Bonds and Consumer Price Inflation - An International Comparison] by Westerheide, Peter (2006) &lt;/ref&gt; however investors looking specifically for inflation protection can instead use individual [[TIPS]], held to maturity, 

If you are using a portfolio of Vanguard market based or style based index funds, you should consider what percentages of REITs are present in Vanguard index funds before adding a separate REIT fund.

==Funds==
Indexed portfolios of equity REITs are available as both [[Mutual fund|mutual funds]] and [[Exchange-traded funds|exchange traded funds]]. [[Fidelity]] and [[The Vanguard Group |Vanguard]] offer low cost REIT index mutual funds. [[BlackRock iShares|iShares]], [[Charles Schwab|Schwab]], Guggenheim, State Street Global Advisors, and Vanguard offer equity REIT exchange traded funds.

      <text bytes="20081" sha1="hkm5ofip8ugla198f3gvt9kuux2wzmi" xml:space="preserve">There is no definitive answer for '''owning vs. renting''' a home. There can be a financial answer as to whether it is ''cheaper'' to buy or rent. However, other considerations such as emotional, environmental, and flexibility can sometimes outweigh decisions that may not be financially justified. 
{{Notice|
This article is ''not'' intended to address owning a home as an investment property (for resale or rental to others), which is a business decision. Refer to the [[#Bogleheads forum discussions | Bogleheads forum discussions]] for insight on this topic.
}} 

==Financial considerations==

===Home affordability===
The first step in the decision-making process is to determine whether or not you can afford to purchase a home.

Issues to consider include your ability to make a down payment (generally between 5% and 20% of the home’s purchase price) and pay closing costs (which may be an additional 5%). These costs are likely to substantially exceed the initial payment and security deposit that would be required if you rent.&lt;ref name="rentbuy"&gt;[http://www.investopedia.com/articles/05/011205.asp?viewed=1 To Rent or Buy? The Financial Issues]&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial purchase is only the first of many expenses incurred in owning a home.

Many financial experts suggest that your monthly mortgage payment not exceed 28% of your gross monthly income and that your total monthly debt payments not exceed 36% of your gross monthly income. If you go beyond these limits, you may run into trouble because, in addition to paying the mortgage each month, you have to factor in home maintenance.&lt;ref name="rentbuy" /&gt; Everything, including the kitchen sink, costs money and nothing lasts forever. 

Renting is usually better from this perspective in the short-term, because it provides a fixed-dollar cost for monthly rent expense. If maintenance issues arise, the landlord pays for the repairs. 

In the long-term, this benefit is more questionable. Because the landlord is trying to make money, it's reasonable to expect the average maintenance costs to be baked into the rent, although there may still be a benefit to the renter of smoothing out expenses year-over-year. On the other hand, owning a home with a fixed-rate mortgage (or no mortgage) provides a high degree of protection against housing cost inflation that is not available when renting - the only costs subject to inflation are maintenance, utilities, and possibly property tax (depending on the local laws for property tax increases). Long-term renters have basically no protection against local or national increases in the cost of housing, except perhaps the landlord's lack of will to raise rent on their tenants.  

===Buy/rent calculator===
This [https://www.nerdwallet.com/mortgages/calculators/rent-vs-buy-calculator Rent vs Buy Calculator] can help you calculate how long you will need to stay in your purchased home for it to be more cost-effective than renting. There are transaction costs associated with buying and selling a home. In particular there are mortgage closing costs when you buy, and a broker fee of about 6% when you sell. Therefore, a house normally must be owned several years before it appreciates enough to offset the transaction costs and make it cheaper than renting.

The Bogleheads' forum has suggested that if you ''do not know'' if you will be in a property for more than 5 years, there is no financial advantage to owning a home. Renting is the best choice in this case.&lt;ref name="bhrentbuy"&gt;[http://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=47248&amp;mrr=1261253477 better to rent or buy??]&lt;/ref&gt;

With ''no other information'', that is probably a good rule of thumb. However, stating that it's ''always'' better to stay in a house for (pick a number) years instead of renting may not be realistic. The situation varies with the individual. In some cases, the advantage can occur as early as 2 years. In other cases, it could be as late as 15 years, and for some it may never break even.&lt;ref name="bhrentbuy" /&gt;

====Comparing similar properties====

For an accurate buy/rent comparison, make sure you are comparing like properties. Though it is common to rent a small apartment when younger, then buy a larger home when starting a family, these properties are not comparable in terms of cost. First, look at your budget and lifestyle and decide how much and what type of housing you should consume, then (if both purchase and rental options are available) perform a buy/rent analysis based on financial and non-financial factors.

Also consider any ways in which your actual costs might not track the broader housing market. For example, if you are renting at a below-market rate (if you have lived in a rental for a long time and the landlord has not raised rent to keep up with the market, renting from family or friends, etc.) moving out would be giving up an effective subsidy, and it may make financial sense to stay in the rental as long as the subsidy lasts. 

Likewise, there may be effective subsidies for staying in a property you currently own, such as a fixed-rate mortgage below the current market interest rate, or property taxes that are below-market because of local laws. Usually, these benefits can be retained when moving by converting the property into a rental, but your will and desire to become a landlord yourself must be considered for this option.

===Owning as an investment===
Separate from the value of having a place to live, a home is an asset that increases or decreases in value over time.

The underlying housing equity is a real asset, but it is an incredibly poorly returning one. According to economist [[Robert Shiller]], "the average annual real (net of inflation) increase in home prices was a mere 0.40%".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.advantageinvesting.com/Articles/Home%20Values%20(8-2008).pdf "Just how overvalued are home prices?" (pdf)], Ronald A. Wright, August 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Of course, any given house might double or triple in value.  But it also might lose value even faster.  In any event, housing is always an extremely illiquid asset.  Unlike stocks or bonds, it can take months to sell a home, and there is a serious risk that if selling during the wrong time, a homeowner can get significantly less than the long term average price.

As an asset class, homes also tend to be highly correlated with economic conditions of their locale.  So, if you lose a job because of hard economic times (such as in Detroit), you may find your home equity simultaneously diminished.

Finally, a home is by definition undiversified. An individual home's value may not track the aggregate residential real estate's market value, even if the housing market in general performs well. Although [[homeowner's insurance]], [[flood insurance]] and [[earthquake insurance]] should protect you from fire, flood, and earthquake, insurance does not provide any guarantee that you will get back the money you paid for your house upon sale.

====Comparison of financial benefits====
When comparing the financial benefits of owning a home to equivalent investment choices had the money been invested otherwise (equities and fixed income), be sure to include:&lt;ref name="bhrentbuy" /&gt;
*Purchase price versus current market level
*Taxes
*Money used for the down payment
The amount of interest over time from the down payment, e.g. 30 years, is probably the biggest single factor missed when comparing investments.

===Forced savings===
Part of the mortgage payment is applied to the loan principal and thus can be thought of as "forced savings" that would not occur if the money was spent on rent. For example, with a 5%, 30 year mortgage 22% of the loan payment goes to principal the first year. During the 5th year 29% goes to principal. If the interest rate is 7% the amounts that go to principal in the first and fifth year are 12% and 18% respectively. These percentages are with respect to the loan payment, excluding taxes and insurance and other fees. These extra fees will reduce the percentage of the overall payment that goes towards principal accordingly.

===Taxation===
There is a large taxation benefit to owning a home versus renting, but it is not the mortgage interest deduction. That deduction is only open to the 30% of taxpayers who itemize their deductions. Plus, the deduction phases out when certain limits are reached.&lt;ref&gt;The deduction also applies to a second home. See [http://www.irs.gov/publications/p936/index.html IRS Publication 936], Home Mortgage Interest Deduction.&lt;/ref&gt;

In any event, mortgage interest is an expense that makes less of the cost of home ownership go toward your equity.  The deduction (when you can claim it) lowers that expense, but the expense remains.

The biggest tax advantage of home ownership is the capital gains exemption.  The first $250 K of profit ($500 K if you're married) from your primary home sale is exempt from capital gains taxes.  If you make $500 K on your home sale, you save $75,000 in taxes(at the 15% long term capital gains rate) which you don't have to pay.  The value of this exemption depends on your opportunity cost.  If you would have invested the excess money for your home into tax-advantaged retirement accounts, the exemption may not mean much.  If your choice is between purchasing a primary home and investing in a taxable account, and you plan to sell the asset (house or mutual funds) before you die, then the $75 K is a significant benefit.  If you leave the house or the mutual funds to your heirs, the capital gains treatment is the same, in that they get a stepped up basis at your death.

===Impact on portfolio (negative bonds) ===
As a liability, a mortgage note is a negative bond.   If you have $300K in bond funds (loaning money), a $300K mortgage note (borrowing money) offsets the bonds in the portfolio.

The house's fair market value (FMV) is an undiversified and illiquid asset that counteracts the negative effect of the mortgage note.  The net asset value (FMV less mortgage note) can become liquid and subsequently diversified when the asset is sold in a competitive market.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bls.gov/cpi/cpifact6.htm "Consumer Price Indexes for Rent and Rental Equivalence"], Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2007-02-09&lt;/ref&gt;  Implicit rent, which is the amount a homeowner would pay to rent, or would earn from renting the house in a competitive market, is also considered a real (positive) bond. The implicit rent is only like a bond in that you can think of it paying a "coupon", but that coupon is a housing voucher good for a month's implicit rent at a single address.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=47550&amp;mrr=1261697621 Mortgage as a "reverse bond" in Allocation Planning] Forum discussion, which includes comparison of bond vs. mortgage "liquidity"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inflation and deflation===
In a high inflation environment, homeowning has two advantages: the value of the home generally stays consistent with inflation, while the cost of a fixed mortgage shrinks dramatically.  Thus, the 1970s were a great time to own a home.  Going forward, it is possible but unlikely that the US will again experience such high inflation.  In addition, there are investment securities such as [[TIPS]] that more directly let you preserve your wealth in an inflationary environment.  If deflation occurred, the fixed mortgage would become more onerous over time, though you could keep refinancing every few years.

===Asset protection===
{{main|Asset protection}}
One advantage of home ownership over owning mutual funds is that in many states, your primary home is protected against creditors in nearly all circumstances.  This could come in to play in bankruptcy or if there were a large lawsuit judgment against you. Florida's homestead exemption&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_homestead_exemption Florida's homestead exemption]&lt;/ref&gt; has no limit to the value of the house that is protected.

==Environment==
Your lifestyle influences where you live.

*The city life or the suburbs
*Distance from work
*Availability and cost of public versus private transportation
**Parking may be a significant cost in the city
*Proximity to shopping, destination spots, health care
**Living near health care providers can be a significant influence for some
*Privacy: living as far as possible from others versus right next to your neighbors

If you can only afford properties (or rentals) in environments that do not fit your preferences, you need to reconsider your options. For example, if you love the city but cannot afford to own, then consider renting.&lt;ref name="rentbuymore"&gt;[http://www.investopedia.com/articles/05/011305.asp?viewed=1 To Rent or Buy? There's More To It Than Money]&lt;/ref&gt;

Location is also important. If you like the area, or if you want to be near friends and family, then you might want to choose accordingly.&lt;ref name="bhrentbuy"&gt;[http://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=47248&amp;mrr=1261253477 better to rent or buy??]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychology==
Many people get a psychological benefit from owning a home. They like feeling that a piece of property is theirs, and that they can settle in and relax there. Homeowners have the maximum say over who can enter their home. Many homeowners get satisfaction from home improvements projects they fund or do themselves.

Like renters, ownership is dependent on making monthly payments. Homeowners should remember that even after the mortgage is paid off, insurance and taxes must still be paid.

==Flexibility==
===Relocation===
The biggest advantage of renting is the flexibility to relocate relatively easily. The situation in which you bought your home can change.
 
For example, the perfect house you bought a few years ago may now be a grueling cross-town commute from the great new job you were recruited to. The second child may mean that you need more room. Having the children leave home means that you're paying for far more space than you need or want. That leaves some homebuyers in a situation where, due to frequent moves, they are always worse off owning than they would be renting.

On the other hand, with the flexibility of renting comes also some instability. The landlord can always raise the rent or ask you to move before you are ready to do so. If you own a house and make the payments, you can stay as long as you want.&lt;ref name="rentbuymore" /&gt;

===Property improvements===
An owner obviously has far more flexibility to make improvements to a home than a renter.

Homeowners who choose to live in areas run by a homeowner association&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeowner_association homeowner association] &lt;/ref&gt; are under significant restrictions, known as Covenants, Conditions, and Restrictions (CC&amp;Rs), on the ability to change their home. For example, many CC&amp;Rs restrict the color you can paint your house, the kinds of plantings you can make, and what you can keep in your front driveway. 

Although counter-intuitive, many people make improvements to their rental properties.  For example, if you're going to be in a rental for a year or more, you may decide to repaint a room or change a fixture.  If you have a reasonable relationship with your landlord, she may approve you doing this work.  If not, you will have to return it to the original condition even if the costs exceed your deposit. Some leases explicitly forbid any changes (like painting and fixtures) at all, so read your lease and talk to your landlord.  Some renters have put as much as $100,000 into improving their rental,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/15/realestate/15cov.html?pagewanted=all Sinking Your Money Into a Rental], Vivian S. Toy, New York Times, 2007-04-15&lt;/ref&gt; but that is not a recommendation to do so yourself!

===Amenities versus customization===

Renting can offer a substantially greater number and variety of amenities than buying. For example, upscale apartment buildings can offer a swimming pool, tennis court, and on-site gym. The monthly rent is comparatively lower than a mortgage for a property with the same attributes.

However, there are affordable homes with private outdoor spaces that you can customize to your liking. There aren’t many apartment buildings that come with acres of property that will let you do your own landscaping, keep horses, or grow a garden.&lt;ref name="rentbuymore" /&gt;

===Maintenance versus available time===
Buying a house gives you the opportunity to choose a unique and distinct architectural style and to personalize it. But this freedom comes with the responsibility of keeping up with maintenance and repairs. If you don’t enjoy cutting the grass or fixing a leaky faucet, you will have to hire someone to do this for you. 

Although renting gives you no control over exterior aesthetics, you don’t have to worry about dealing with wear and tear on your residence. Renting still gives you plenty of opportunity to choose furnishings and decorate your interior environment in a manner that suits your style. And, as a renter, all you have to do when something goes wrong is notify your landlord.&lt;ref name="rentbuymore" /&gt;

===Rental variety===
There is a common misconception that only apartments are available for rent.  Although most rentals are apartments, homes in every category from 400 sq ft shacks to 15,000 sq ft mansions are available for rent.

Another misconception is that you buy to be located in a good school district.  There are expensive and inexpensive rental properties available in every school district in the nation.

If you are concerned about having to move after a year, most landlords would be thrilled to sign 2 or 3 year leases.  But this is normally unnecessary.  Many landlords are grateful to have a renter who reliably pays their rent, and will happily keep you as a tenant for a decade or more.

A '''reverse mortgage''' allows homeowners 62 and older to withdraw a portion of home equity as income or a line of credit without selling the home or making monthly payments. In 2009, half of homeowners 62 or older had 55% or more of their net worth in home equity.&lt;ref name="report"&gt;[https://files.consumerfinance.gov/a/assets/documents/201206_cfpb_Reverse_Mortgage_Report.pdf "Report to Congress on Reverse Mortgages"], Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, June 28, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; A reverse mortgage has been described as a loan of last resort because it can mean fewer assets for the homeowner and heirs. When the last surviving borrower dies, sells the home, or no longer lives in the home as a principal residence, the loan has to be repaid. In certain situations, a non-borrowing spouse may be able to remain in the home. The first reverse mortgage in the United States was issued in 1961. In 1987 Congress passed a reverse mortgage pilot program called the Home Equity Conversion Mortgage Demonstration, signed into law in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/R44128 Congress.gov-HUD’s Reverse Mortgage Insurance Program: Home Equity Conversion Mortgages]&lt;/ref&gt;

Reverse mortgages saw abuses by lenders and earned a bad reputation when the housing bubble burst in 2008-2010.&lt;ref&gt;Carole Fleck, [https://www.aarp.org/money/credit-loans-debt/info-10-2009/reverse_mortgages_ripe_for_abuse.html "Reverse Mortgages Ripe for Abuse"], ''AARP Bulletin'', October 7, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.napsa-now.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/FACT-SHEET-Elder-Financial-Abuse_Reverse-Mortgage-Scams-06-13.pdf NAPSA-Reverse Mortgage Scams]&lt;/ref&gt; The number of reverse mortgages dropped from an annual peak of about 115,000 in 2009 to 30,000 in 2016, according to the Federal Housing Administration. Reverse mortgages are now regulated by the Federal Housing Administration and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. For FHA Home Equity Conversion Mortgages, the FHA covers any difference between the sale value and the mortgage balance, preventing "underwater" loans.&lt;ref&gt;John F. Wasik, [https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/23/your-money/the-quiet-comeback-of-reverse-mortgages.html?_r=0 "The Quiet Comeback of Reverse Mortgages"], ''The New York Times'', July 22, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three types or reverse mortgages: FHA Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM), single-purpose reverse mortgage, and proprietary reverse mortgage.&lt;ref name="ftc"&gt;Federal Trade Commission, [https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0192-reverse-mortgages "FTC Consumer Information: Reverse Mortgages"], retrieved July 23, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==FHA Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM)==
The Federal Housing Administration's (FHA's) Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM) is a federally-insured mortgage backed by the U. S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). This is the most common type of reverse mortgage. The loans can be used for any purpose. They are more expensive than traditional home loans or single-purpose reverse mortgages and the financing costs are higher, a factor if the home stay is short or the mortgage is small.&lt;ref name="ftc" /&gt;

FHA Reverse Mortgages (HECMs) for Seniors&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, [https://consumer.ftc.gov/articles/reverse-mortgages "Reverse Mortgages"].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Borrower Requirements''' -- You must
* Be 62 years of age or older
* Own the property outright or paid-down a considerable amount&lt;ref group="note"&gt;"Considerable" is not defined, but factors into the required financial assessment. &lt;/ref&gt;
* Occupy the property as your principal residence
* Not be delinquent on any federal debt
* Have financial resources to continue to make timely payment of ongoing property charges such as property taxes, insurance and Homeowner Association fees, etc.
* Participate in a consumer information session given by a HUD-approved HECM counselor&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Search online for "HECM counselor" or call (800) 569-4287 toll-free. Counseling agencies usually charge a fee for their services, often around $125. This fee can be paid from the loan proceeds, and you cannot be denied for lack of fee.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Property Requirements''' -- The following eligible property types must meet all FHA property standards and flood requirements:
* Single family home or 2-4 unit home with one unit occupied by the borrower
* HUD-approved condominium project
* Manufactured home that meets FHA requirements

'''Mortgage Amount Based On''' -- The amount you may borrow will depend on:
* Age of the youngest borrower or eligible non-borrowing spouse
* Current interest rate
* Lesser of the appraised value or the HECM FHA mortgage limit of $1,209,750 (as of 2025) or the sales price
If there is more than one borrower and no eligible non-borrowing spouse, the age of the youngest borrower is used to determine the&lt;br&gt; amount you can borrow.

'''Financial Requirements''' 
* Income, assets, monthly living expenses, and credit history will be verified.
* Timely payment of real estate taxes, hazard and flood insurance premiums will be verified
*For adjustable interest rate mortgages, you can select one of the following payment plans:
** Tenure - equal monthly payments as long as at least one borrower lives and continues to occupy the property as a principal residence.
** Term - equal monthly payments for a fixed period of months selected.
** Line of Credit - unscheduled payments or in installments, at times and in an amount of your choosing until the line of credit is exhausted.
** Modified Tenure - combination of line of credit and scheduled monthly payments for as long as you remain in the home.
** Modified Term - combination of line of credit plus monthly payments for a fixed period of months selected by the borrower.
*For fixed interest rate mortgages, you will receive the Single Disbursement Lump Sum payment plan.

'''HECM Costs'''

You can pay for most of the costs of a HECM by financing them and having them paid from the proceeds of the loan. Financing the costs means that you do not have to pay for them out of your pocket. On the other hand, financing the costs reduces the net loan amount available to you.

The HECM loan includes several fees and charges, which includes: 1) mortgage insurance premiums (initial and annual) 2) third party charges 3) origination fee 4) interest and 5) servicing fees. The lender will discuss which fees and charges are mandatory.

You will be charged an initial mortgage insurance premium (MIP) at closing. The initial MIP will be .5 percent or 2.5 percent, depending on your disbursements. Over the life of the loan, you will be charged an annual MIP that equals 1.25% of the outstanding mortgage balance.

'''Mortgage Insurance Premium'''
You will incur a cost for FHA mortgage insurance. The mortgage insurance guarantees that you will receive expected loan advances. You can finance the mortgage insurance premium (MIP) as part of your loan.

'''Third Party Charges'''
Closing costs from third parties can include an appraisal, title search and insurance, surveys, inspections, recording fees, mortgage taxes, credit checks and other fees.

'''Origination Fee'''
You will pay an origination fee to compensate the lender for processing your HECM loan. A lender can charge the greater of $2,500 or 2% of the first $200,000 of your home's value plus 1% of the amount over $200,000. HECM origination fees are capped at $6,000.

'''Servicing Fee'''
Lenders or their agents provide servicing throughout the life of the HECM. Servicing includes sending you account statements, disbursing loan proceeds and making certain that you keep up with loan requirements such as paying real estate taxes and hazard insurance premium. Lenders may charge a monthly servicing fee of no more than $30 if the loan has an annually adjusting interest rate or has a fixed interest rate. The lender may charge a monthly servicing fee of no more than $35 if the interest rate adjusts monthly. At loan closing, the lender sets aside the servicing fee and deducts the fee from your available funds. Each month the monthly servicing fee is added to your loan balance. Lenders may also choose to include the servicing fee in the mortgage interest rate.}}

In general, the older you are and the more equity you have in your home, the greater the loan can be.&lt;ref name="ftc" /&gt;

One unusual suggestion for a reverse mortgage is for buying a new home to downsize:
{{blockquote|"Instead of eliminating debts, paying for healthcare or covering daily living expenses, you can also use a reverse mortgage to purchase a new home that better suits your needs. The advantage of using HECM for Purchase is that the new home is purchased outright, using funds from the sale of the old home, private savings, gift money and other sources of income, which are then combined with the reverse mortgage proceeds. This home buying process leaves you with no monthly mortgage payments."&lt;ref&gt;National Reverse Mortgage Lenders Association (NRMLA), [https://www.reversemortgage.org/About/Types-of-Reverse-Mortgages/HECM-Payment-Options HECM Payment Options], retrieved July 24, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Single-purpose reverse mortgage==
Single-purpose reverse mortgages are the least expensive option. They are offered by some state and local governments and non-profit organizations, but they are not available everywhere. These loans may be used only for the purpose specified by the lender, for example, home repairs, improvements, or property taxes. Low or moderate income homeowners can qualify for these loans.&lt;ref name="ftc" /&gt;

These loans are not widely available and make up a tiny percentage of the reverse mortgage market. They often go by another name, such as property tax deferral programs.&lt;ref&gt;''Investopedia'', [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/singlepurpose-reverse-mortgage.asp "Single-Purpose Reverse Mortgage"], retrieved July 23, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately half the states have some type of property tax deferral program.&lt;ref name="report" /&gt; Check the details for your state.

==Proprietary reverse mortgage==
Proprietary reverse mortgages are private loans backed by the companies that offer them. Higher-appraised homes might qualify for a bigger loan with a proprietary reverse mortgage. They are more expensive than traditional home loans or single-purpose reverse mortgages and the financing costs are higher, important if you plan to stay in your home for a short time or borrow a small amount.&lt;ref name="ftc" /&gt;

The loan size depends on the same factors as an HECM, but is limited only by the risk the lender is willing to take. These mortgages vanished after the housing bubble burst in 2008-2010, then returned when home prices rebounded. They are not as common as HECMs because they lack a secondary market for lenders, and cannot be easily secured by sale to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.&lt;ref&gt;''Investopedia'', [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proprietary-reverse-mortgage.asp "Proprietary Reverse Mortgage"], retrieved July 23, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reverse mortgage benefits==

* For retirees with most of their wealth tied up in home equity, a reverse mortgage can provide needed liquidity and help with ongoing expenses. A 2010 NMRLA survey reported 56% of seniors with a reverse mortgage would not be able to cover monthly expenses without it.&lt;ref&gt;[https://financialservices.house.gov/uploadedfiles/hhrg-112-ba04-wstate-pbell-20120509.pdf NRMLA - Testimony of Peter H. Bell, President &amp; CEO National Reverse Mortgage Lenders Association before the Subcommittee on Insurance, Housing &amp; Community Opportunity House Financial Services Committee]&lt;/ref&gt; Another study indicated that 1/3 of reverse mortgage holders used them for medical expenses while staying in their home.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.albany.edu/sites/default/files/2019-08/Makoto%20Nakajima.pdf Reverse Mortgage Loans: A Quantitative Analysis]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Multiple consumer surveys have found consumers were generally satisfied with their reverse mortgages:
** A 2006 survey of borrowers by AARP showed 93 percent said their reverse mortgage had a "mostly positive" effect on their lives.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mtgprofessor.com/A%20-%20Reverse%20Mortgages/Reverse%20Mortgages%20Are%20Not%20the%20Next%20Subprime.html "Reverse Mortgages Are Not the Next Sub-Prime"], Mortgage Professor.com, January 25, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; 
** A 2010 National Reverse Mortgage Lenders Association survey of 600 seniors with reverse mortgages found that close to 80% reported their satisfaction with their reverse mortgage above six on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being the highest. 43% marked their satisfaction at a 10.  
** A 2016 survey of 1,761 households funded by The MacArthur Foundation also showed that 83% of seniors were satisfied or highly satisfied with their reverse mortgage.  
** A 2020 study by the Journal of Gerontology, which surveyed 1,088 older adults, found that seniors with reverse mortgages had higher housing and life satisfaction rates than seniors without them.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.financeofamerica.com/education/reverse-mortgages-reputation/ Finance of America - How reverse mortgages got such a bad reputation]&lt;/ref&gt; 

* A reverse mortgage, when set up early in retirement, can provide protection against sequence of return risks and allow for a greater withdrawal rate. Additionally, investors, who are comfortable with greater risk may choose to use a reverse mortgage early in retirement to increase their equity exposure, potentially leading to a greater legacy for future generations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.morningstar.com/personal-finance/don-graves-wade-pfau-how-home-equity-affects-retirement-planning Morningstar - Don Graves and Wade Pfau: How Home Equity Affects Retirement Planning]&lt;/ref&gt;

* Retirees are never at risk for more than the market value equity in their home. A reverse mortgage can serve as a form of longevity insurance, with the value of the loan exceeding the market value of the home but not being responsible for the shortfall.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.financialplanningassociation.org/article/journal/FEB17-enhance-lifetime-retirement-security-use-reverse-mortgages-or-immediate-annuities Financial Planning Association - To Enhance Lifetime Retirement Security, Use Reverse Mortgages or Immediate Annuities?]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cbsnews.com/news/can-you-outlive-a-reverse-mortgage/ CBS News-Can you outlive a reverse mortgage?]&lt;/ref&gt;
==Reverse mortgage criticism==
The most common criticism is that reverse mortgages are more expensive than traditional home loans and the financing costs are higher, including higher upfront fees and higher interest rates.&lt;ref name="ftc" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.consumerfinance.gov/ask-cfpb/how-much-does-a-reverse-mortgage-loan-cost-en-237/ CFPB-How much does a reverse mortgage loan cost?]&lt;/ref&gt; But other problems have been noted:
* Because there are no required mortgage payments, the interest is added to the loan balance each month. The rising loan balance can eventually grow to exceed the value of the home, particularly in times of declining home values or if the borrower continues to live in the home for many years.&lt;ref name="report" /&gt; That said, with an FHA-insured HECM the borrower can never owe more than the value of the property.
* Reverse mortgages can be confusing, and many obtain them without fully understanding the terms and conditions. In October of 2010, the National Reverse Mortgage Lenders Association (NRMLA) surveyed 600 owners with reverse mortgages across the U.S., and only 46% of respondents felt they understood the financial terms "very well" when they secured their reverse mortgage.&lt;ref&gt;[https://services.nrmlaonline.org/NRMLA_Documents/NRMLA_Poll_Presentation.pdf NRMLA - reverse mortgage study]&lt;/ref&gt; A Consumer Financial Protection Bureau report to Congress in 2012 stated that "government investigations and consumer advocacy groups raised significant consumer protection concerns about the business practices of reverse mortgage lenders and other companies in the reverse mortgage industry."&lt;ref name="report" /&gt;
* Information available to help consumers understand prices and risks, including federally required disclosures and counseling, are not sufficient to ensure that they are making good decisions.&lt;ref name="report" /&gt;
* Homeowners are taking out reverse mortgages at increasingly younger ages with more money upfront, exhausting their resources sooner.&lt;ref name="report" /&gt; 
* Boglehead poster White Coat Investor lists additional potential [https://www.whitecoatinvestor.com/the-problems-with-reverse-mortgages/ problems with reverse mortgages.] 

==Other options==
Unlike a reverse mortgage, the first two options require monthly repayments to the lender. A reverse mortgage is generally easier to qualify for than a home equity loan or home equity line of credit (HELOC), which require adequate income and credit scores.&lt;ref name="report" /&gt; The HELOC is more flexible than the home equity loan, and a less expensive way to borrow smaller amounts if the principal is paid back quickly. In general, a reverse mortgage is better for long-term income in spite of a reduced estate. A home equity loan or HELOC is better for short-term cash, if you can make monthly repayments and want to avoid selling.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Folger, [https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/101714/reverse-mortgage-or-home-equity-loan.asp "Reverse Mortgage Or Home-Equity Loan?"], ''Investopedia'', October 17, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Home equity loan===
A home equity loan is a "second mortgage", a lump sum paid back over a set time period, using the home as collateral. The loan is based on the difference between the homeowner's equity and the home's current market value. The mortgage also provides collateral for an asset-backed security issued by the lender and sometimes tax-deductible interest for the borrower. 

Interest rates on such loans are usually adjustable rather than fixed, but lower than standard second mortgages or credit cards. Loan terms are usually shorter than first mortgages.&lt;ref&gt;''Investopedia'', [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/homeequityloan.asp Home equity loan], retrieved July 23, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Home equity line of credit===
A home equity line of credit (HELOC) is more like a credit card that uses the home as collateral. A maximum loan balance is established, and the homeowner may draw on it at discretion. Interest is predetermined and variable, and usually based on prevailing prime rates. 

Once there is a balance owed, the homeowner can choose the repayment schedule as long as minimum interest payments are made monthly. The term of a HELOC can last anywhere from less than five to more than 20 years, at the end of which all balances must be paid in full. The interest is often tax-deductible, making it more attractive than some alternatives.&lt;ref&gt;''Investopedia'', [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/homeequitylineofcredit.asp Home equity line of credit], retrieved July 23, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Government benefit programs===
Many consumers considering a reverse mortgage may not realize they are eligible for government benefit programs. One reverse mortgage counseling agency reports finding other solutions for 50% of the potential borrowers it counsels. Available benefits include federal programs such as [[Planning for disabled adult children#Supplemental Security Income (SSI)|Supplemental Security Income (SSI)]] and state and local programs such as home energy assistance.&lt;ref name="ss"&gt;[https://www.cbsnews.com/news/will-a-reverse-mortgage-impact-your-social-security-or-medicare-benefits/ Will a reverse mortgage impact your Social Security or Medicare benefits?]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Taxes and government assistance==
Reverse mortgages have been suggested as a possible tool to lower income taxes in retirement (see [[Social Security tax impact calculator]]). Generally, money from a reverse mortgage is not taxable and does not affect Social Security or Medicare benefits.&lt;ref name="ftc" /&gt; Eligibility for certain government assistance programs may be limited.&lt;ref name="ss" /&gt;

{{quotation|"A reverse mortgage does not affect regular Social Security or Medicare benefits. '''However, if you are on Medicaid or Supplemental Security Income (SSI), any reverse mortgage proceeds that you receive must be used immediately. Funds that you retain count as an asset and could impact eligibility.''' For example, if you receive $4,000 in a lump sum for home repairs and spend it all the same calendar month, everything is fine. Any residual funds remaining in your bank account the following month would count as an asset. If the total liquid resources (including other bank funds and savings bonds) exceed $2,000 for an individual or $3,000 for a couple, you would be ineligible for Medicaid. To be safe, you should contact the local Area Agency on Aging or a Medicaid expert."&lt;ref&gt;National Reverse Mortgage Lenders Association (NRMLA), [https://www.reversemortgage.org/Get-Help/Most-Frequently-Asked-Questions#social "Most Frequently Asked Questions"], retrieved July 24, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; ''(emphasis added)''}}

A '''bond''' is a debt investment. Investors loan money to corporations or governments for a set term and interest rate. After they have been issued, bonds trade on the over-the-counter market, where their principal value fluctuates according to changes in interest rates and any changes in the bond's credit quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.investinginbonds.com/learnmore.asp?catid=3&amp;id=383| publisher=Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association| title=Risks of Investing in Bonds| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220331004748/https://www.investinginbonds.com/learnmore.asp?catid=3&amp;id=383| archive-date=March 31, 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newly issued [[Corporate bonds | corporate bonds]] are syndicated by investment banks who initially buy an offering for resale to investors. Government bonds are offered by auction, where investors tender bids for the issue.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikipedia:Bond (finance)| Bond (finance)]], from Wikipedia&lt;/ref&gt; Investors typically use bonds to stabilize the value of a portfolio, or to produce a stream of income, or both.

==Features==

[[File:Bonddiagram.gif|frame|400px|right| Advanced Bond Concepts:Bond Type Specifics, Investopedia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/022516/understanding-different-types-bond-yields.asp| title=Understanding the Different Types of Bond Yields| publisher=Investopedia| date=September 30, 2022| accessdate=August 13, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Bonds have some distinctive features. These include:
*'''Coupon rate''': the interest rate paid by the bond. The rate may be fixed, floating, or inflation indexed, depending on the specific issue. The coupon date gives the frequency of interest payments, usually biannually for US bonds. Bonds which pay a fixed coupon rate based upon the principal (face amount) are called [[Nominal bond |''nominal'' bonds]].
*'''Maturity date''': the date at which the bond principal will be repaid. Bonds are usually issued with maturities [[Money markets | ranging from 1 year]] to thirty years.
*'''Options''': the most common option involving bonds is a '''call feature'''. This gives the issuer the right to repay the bond before the maturity date. Because an issuer will call bonds when the interest rate is lower than the coupon rate, it is not advantageous to the buyer of the bond, who must then reinvest the proceeds of the redeemed bond in a lower interest rate environment. Because of this, a callable bond usually offers a higher coupon than an uncallable bond, to compensate for the risk of early redemption. Some callable bonds also add a small sum to the par value of a redeemed bond. Alternatively, some bonds are issued with a '''put feature''' which gives the bond holder the right to force the issuer to repay the bond before the maturity date, usually on predefined put dates.
*'''Sinking funds''' provide a means of repaying a bond issue. The issuer makes periodic payments to a trustee who retires part of the issue by purchasing the bonds in the open market. Sinking funds tend to reduce the risk of default, which lets the issuer of a bond to pay a lower interest rate on the bond. 
*'''Senior debt''' and '''Subordinated debt''': [[Wikipedia:Senior debt|Senior debt]] has priority over other debt in case of default; [[Wikipedia:Subordinated debt|Subordinated debt]] is unsecured and, in a default, is [[Wikipedia:Bond (finance)| repayable]] after other debts have been paid.

==Types of bonds==

There are three main issuers of bonds in the U.S.: the Treasury; corporations; and municipalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Annette Thau| title=The Bond Book| publisher=McGraw-Hill| date=2001| pages=29-36| isbn=0-07-135862-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Treasury bonds===
'''[[Treasury Bonds]]''' are issued by the US treasury in groups of three maturity ranges
*Bills have a range up to one year;
*Notes have a range between one year and ten years;
*Bonds have a range greater than ten years. 

Treasury bonds are usually not callable. Treasuries also carry the full faith and credit backing of the U.S. government. The interest income is exempt from state tax. You can purchase Treasuries through brokerages and banks as well as through an individual account at [https://www.treasurydirect.gov/marketable-securities/treasury-bills/ Treasury Direct]. Government agencies also issue debt, some of which is backed by the full faith and credit of the government, and some which is not.

'''[[Treasury Inflation Protected Securities]]''' (TIPS) give you both inflation indexed income and inflation protection for the bond's principal. The bond pays a fixed real interest rate based on a principal value indexed to the CPI-U inflation measure. Like all treasury bonds, inflation indexed treasuries have the "full faith and credit" backing of the Treasury and interest income and inflation adjusted accruals are exempt from state taxation. However, you must pay federal tax annually on the inflation adjusted accruals. This tax on "phantom income" means that you should try to hold these bonds in tax-advantaged accounts.

===Corporate bonds===
'''[[Corporate bonds]]''' are issued by corporations and are often callable. Because a corporation can default on its debts, corporate bonds have credit risk, and so usually pay higher coupon interest rates over comparable term treasury maturities as compensation for this risk. Corporate bonds are taxable, both for federal and for state income tax. 

===Municipal bonds===
'''[[Municipal bonds]]''' are issued by states and localities. These bonds have credit risk. Many municipal bonds are also callable. The bonds are generally exempt from federal tax, although some private revenue municipal bonds are subject to the federal alternative minimum tax. A tax exempt bond is also usually state tax exempt for residents of the state issuing the bond. Because of these tax preferences, municipal bonds usually offer lower coupon interest rates than do comparable term treasuries and corporate bonds. 

===Other types of bonds===

====Zero-coupon bonds====
'''[[Zero-coupon bond |Zero Coupon bonds]]''' are accrual bonds and do not pay current coupon interest. They are issued at a deep discount from par value and compound continuously at the coupon rate. Holders receive the full principal amount as well as the value that has accrued from interest on the redemption date. Financial institutions can create zero coupon bonds from fixed rate bonds by "stripping off" the coupons. In other words, the coupons and the final principal payment of the bond are separate, and trade independently. Holders pay tax on the annual accrual of income, although they receive no current interest payment.

====Asset-backed securities====
'''[[Asset-backed securities]]''' are bonds whose interest and principal payments are backed by underlying cash flows from other assets. Examples of asset-backed securities are [[Mortgage-backed security|mortgage-backed securities]] (MBSs), which include GNMA securities backed by the full faith and credit of the US treasury, collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs) and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), whose underlying securities are often assets such as auto loans or credit card receivables.

====High yield bonds====
'''[[High yield bonds]]''' are corporate bonds with lower credit quality than top credits. These companies are at much greater risk of default than higher quality credits and, as a result, pay higher coupon interest rates than comparable high quality corporate bonds.

==Sources of return==

There are three sources of return for a bond:
# Return of principal
# Interest (coupon payments)
# Interest-on-interest (reinvested coupon payments)

According to [[Frank J. Fabozzi]] in the ''The Handbook of Fixed Income Securities'' (1991, page 97):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Frank J. Fabozzi| author-link=Frank J. Fabozzi| title=The Handbook of Fixed Income Securities| date=2005| publisher=McGraw-Hill| isbn=978-0071440998}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{blockquote|In high interest rate environments, the interest-on-interest component for long-term bonds may be as high as 70 percent of the bond's potential total dollar return.}}
In low interest rate environments, the principal is likely the largest source of value of all but the longest bonds. The figure below illustrates the three sources of bond return:

[[File:Sources_of_bond_return.png|800px]]

==Risks==

Each of the following risks of bonds carries some premium as compensation for bearing these risks. The amount of that premium varies according to the market's assessment of the likelihood of the adverse event occurring.

===Interest rate risk===

Interest rate risk, also called price risk, is that the value of a bond fluctuates depending on the interest rate. Also known as "market risk." The amount of interest rate risk assumed is measured primarily by the [[Bonds: advanced topics#Duration | duration]], and secondarily by [[Bonds: advanced topics#Convexity | convexity]]. See [[#Bonds on the secondary_market | below]] for more information on how bond prices react to interest rate changes.

Interest rate risk is in some sense an artifact of the traditional framework which looks at short-term returns. Over longer periods, longer duration bonds will have a more certain return than short-term bonds, as a quote from John Campbell and Luis Viceira's academic text, ''Strategic Asset Allocation'' (pages 86-87), makes clear:
{{blockquote|If one uses conventional mean-variance analysis, it is hard to explain why any investors hold large positions in bonds. Mean-variance analysis treats cash as the riskless asset and bonds as merely another risky asset like stocks. Bonds are valued only for their potential contribution to the short-run excess return, relative to risk, of a diversified risky portfolio. ... A long-horizon analysis treats bonds very differently, and assigns them a much more important role in the optimal portfolio. For long-term investors, money market investments are not riskless because they must be rolled over at uncertain future interest rates.}}

Because unexpected inflation changes that picture somewhat, the reduced risk of longer-term bonds is primarily true when discussing inflation-protected bonds in real dollars (or nominal bonds with nominal liabilities).

===Credit risk===

Credit risk is a risk that the issuer of a bond may default. Also known as "default risk." 

The major ratings agencies (Moody's, S&amp;P, and Fitch) assess credit risk.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Moody's Investors Service, Fitch, and Standard &amp; Poor's Ratings Services are three of several credit rating agencies the SEC categorizes as a [http://www.sec.gov/answers/nrsro.htm Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (NRSRO)]. The SEC's Office of Credit Ratings maintains a list here: [http://www.sec.gov/ocr/ratingagency.html Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations ("NRSROs")]&lt;/ref&gt; Each [[#Credit ratings | credit rating]] has an expected rate of default, which increases substantially in lower tiers. For a given credit rating, the default rate has historically been lower for municipal bonds than for corporate bonds. Wikipedia has [[wikipedia:Bond credit rating | tables]]] of how the ratings compare between ratings firms and of historical default rates.

===Call risk===

Call risk is a risk that the issuer may call the bond, terminating a stream of income for investors. This risk is often called prepayment risk for [[Mortgage Backed Securities | mortgage backed securities]]. Call options embedded in a bond lead to negative [[convexity]].

===Reinvestment risk===

Reinvestment risk is a risk that when a bond matures or is called, an investor may have to reinvest the proceeds in a bond yielding a lower interest.

===Inflation risk===

Inflation risk is a risk that the interest from a bond may not keep up with inflation. [[Treasury_Inflation_Protected_Securities|TIPS]] are inflation-adjusted and therefore largely immune to inflation risk. Also known as "purchasing power risk."

===Liquidity risk===

Liquidity risk is the risk that you may not be able to extract the remaining value from your bond in the timeframe needed without losing a disproportionate amount of value. Thinly-traded issues (such as most corporate, municipal, and TIPS issues) have liquidity risk. The liquidity premium is expected to rise in times of crisis. Also known as "marketability risk."

Liquidity risk can be seen most clearly in "off-the-run" Treasury bonds, where an older but otherwise identical bond trades at a reduced price (or higher yield) simply because it is less liquid.

=== Other risks ===

These risks are either not important for individual investors or are generally wrapped into the risks above (for example, credit risk commonly encompasses event risk). They are included here for completeness.

* '''Yield curve or maturity risk''': Generally only important in hedging situations.
* '''Exchange rate or currency risk''': Only relevant for non-dollar-denominated bonds. [[John Bogle]] does not recommend these.
* '''Volatility risk''': Volatility affects bonds with embedded options (commonly a corporate bond with a call option), because an option's value depends on volatility. If the price of an issue is highly volatile, the likelihood of a random fluctuation straying above the strike price is much greater.
* '''Political or legal risk''': Tax-code changes and regulatory decisions can all affect the value of a bond. 
* '''Event risk''': A type of credit risk which affects many firms due to a single event (and therefore event risk cannot be fully diversified away).
* '''Sector risk''': A type of credit risk which affects all or many firms in a single sector.

==Credit ratings==

Three major ratings agencies assess the likelihood of a bond defaulting and assign that bond ratings according to a standardized scale.

For a given credit rating, the default rate has historically been lower for municipal bonds than for corporate bonds.

==Factors affecting bond prices==
{{main|Bond pricing}}
See [[Bond pricing]] for definitions of bond pricing terminology. (This is an advanced topic.)

===New issues===
Two major factors primarily set the coupon of a newly issued bond: the credit quality of the bond, and the maturity of the bond. Investors taking on higher risks expect higher return. Because of this, the US Treasury can pay a lower coupon on its debt than corporate borrowers, who are subject to default risk. Three credit rating agencies trade non treasury debt. The table above describes the ratings.

The longer the maturity of a bond, the greater the risk to the bondholder. Longer time horizons increase the likelihood that a bond issuer will become a greater credit risk through bad management decisions, the deterioration of economic conditions, or the company engaging in future merger and acquisition activity which changes the leverage of a company's balance sheet. Longer horizons also increase the likelihood that a bond's coupon income will be eroded by higher than expected inflation.

Finance economics defines a bond's expected return as comprising three basic building blocks:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author1=Elroy Dimson| author1-link=Elroy Dimson| author2=Paul R. Marsh| author3=Mike Staunton| title=Triumph of the Optimists: 101 Years of Global Investment Return| publisher=Princeton University Press| date=2002| pages=89-90| isbn=0-691-09194-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Default risk premium''': the risk-free rate as defined by the current yield of a treasury bill
* '''Time horizon premium''': a time horizon premium to compensate investors for the risks of longer maturities
* '''T-bill rate''': and a default risk premium to compensate investors for bearing credit risk.

===Bonds on the secondary market===

Once a bond is issued, it trades on the secondary market, and fluctuates in price until it matures. A bond will change in price for two main reasons:
* The bond's credit rating has changed (either upgraded or downgraded).
* Interest rates have changed.

Unless a bond is falling into or out of default, price movements associated with changes in credit rating are usually infrequent, although during periods of economic distress and economic recovery credit rating changes can be significant price factors. The ever present driver of changes in a bond's market value comes from fluctuations in current market interest rates.

An example can illustrate how bond pricing works. Suppose you purchase, at issue, a $1,000 ten year bond yielding a 5% coupon. This entitles you to $50 of annual income. Then, suppose that one year later, interest rates have risen to 6% and you wish to liquidate the bond. No rational investor will pay you $1,000 for $50 of income, when they can receive $60 annually for the same $1,000 dollar investment. In this scenario, your 5% bond will have to decrease in market value until its current yield approximately produces a 6% return.

A similar, yet opposite price movement occurs if interest rates fall. Suppose instead that interest rates fall to 4 percent during the year after your purchase. Your $1,000 bond produces $50 of annual income in an environment where investors can only receive $40 of annual income from a newly issued bond. Your bond will therefore rise in price until it provides a purchaser with a 4% return.

This is the basic rule of bond price movements in the open market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Annette Thau| title=The Bond Book| publisher=McGraw-Hill| date=2001| page=30| isbn=0-07-135862-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{| class=wikitable style="text-align:center" width=400px

| align="center" style="background:#f0f0f0;"|'''Then'''
|-
| interest rates rise||bond prices fall
|-
| interest rates fall||bond prices rise
|}

To calculate how much prices will rise or fall, please see [[Bonds:_Advanced_Topics#Duration | Duration]].

A corollary to this is that, all other things being equal, price fluctuations are greater for long maturities than for shorter maturities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Annette Thau| title=The Bond Book| publisher=McGraw-Hill| date=2001| page=73| isbn=0-07-135862-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; At any given time in the secondary market you are likely to find any number of bonds selling at a discount over par value, or at a premium to par value.

==Role in a portfolio==
Investors typically use bonds to stabilize the value of a portfolio, or to produce a stream of income, or both. For more see [[Asking bond questions]] for tips on how to ask about bonds on the [http://www.bogleheads.org/forum/index.php Forum].

===Long- vs. short-term===

Boglehead and financial expert [[William Bernstein]] recommends limiting bond holdings to short-term funds,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=William Bernstein| date=December 30, 2009| url=https://archive.nytimes.com/bucks.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/12/30/pascal-and-the-long-term-bond-dilemma/ |title=Pascal and the long-term bond dilemma| publisher=New York Times| accessdate=August 13, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; because of their relative immunity to the risk of unexpected inflation.

However, an article by Vanguard&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://personal.vanguard.com/us/insights/article/duration-diversification-052015| title=The long and short of finding bond balance| date=June 12, 2015| publisher=Vanguard| accessdate=March 21, 2016}}{{dead link}}&lt;/ref&gt; argues that when the yield curve is particularly steep, running to short-term bonds for safety can result in losses if the yield curve flattens.

A common recommendation of other experts is intermediate-term funds. Long-term bonds have historically returned no more than intermediate-term bonds, but with far greater volatility--in other words, their risk has not been rewarded. Yale endowment manager David Swensen recommends long-term Treasuries, however, as part of a portfolio dominated by equities, as they will provide the biggest counterweight to the collapse of other asset classes during a deflationary crisis.

Even proponents of short-term bonds such as Dr. Bernstein are comfortable with longer-term holdings in inflation-protected securities such as [[Treasury_Inflation_Protected_Securities | TIPS]], as they no longer carry any risk of unexpected inflation, leaving them vulnerable only to a real rate rise (which if held to the duration incurs only an opportunity cost).

While you should always keep the [[Bonds:_Advanced_Topics#Duration | duration]] less than or equal to your investment horizon, unless you have a specific funding need to be met at a specific date (in which case a [[Zero-coupon bond]] is the risk-free solution), you should choose between short-term and intermediate-term funds. The former is lower risk but the latter has historically given investors higher overall returns.

===Credit quality===

The ''[[Bogleheads' Guide To Investing]]'' authors recommend Vanguard's Total Bond Market, which contains investment-grade [[Corporate bonds |corporate bonds]]. [[John Bogle]] also recommends Total Bond Market, although he seems to prefer Vanguard's Intermediate-Term Index Fund for its lack of [[MBS]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| date=June 15, 2007| url=https://johncbogle.com/wordpress/2007/06/15/john-bogle-responds-to-ask-jack-questions-2/| title=John Bogle responds to "Ask Jack" questions| publisher= The Bogle Eblog}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, Boglehead and bond expert [[Larry Swedroe]] recommends only the very highest quality investments for bonds (and specifically recommends against Total Bond Market because of its negative [[Bonds:_Advanced_Topics#Convexity | convexity]]), citing evidence in which the risk of corporate bonds has not historically rewarded investors. Yale endowment manager David Swensen also recommends only Treasuries.

Finally, Boglehead and financial expert Rick Ferri advocates for not only the inclusion of investment-grade corporate bonds but also [[High yield bonds | high yield bonds]], on the basis of their diversification benefits.

Perhaps the best conclusion that can be drawn from the highly respected but conflicting advice is to:
* Ensure that your bond holdings are built around a core of Treasuries.
* If you choose to include corporate bonds, understand the risks you are taking (moderate in relation to stock investing but nevertheless quite real), and do not include too high a proportion. A good benchmark would be the market portfolio represented by Vanguard's Total Bond Market fund.
* If you choose to include high-yield bonds which incorporate considerable default and call risk, you take the funds from the equity portion of your asset allocation rather than the bond portion.

===Taxes===

Almost all of the return on a bond or bond fund comes from the dividend yield, which is fully taxed; in contrast, stocks get most of their return from price appreciation, which is not taxed until the stocks are sold and is taxed at the capital-gains tax rate. Therefore, when bond interest rates are relatively high, bonds are widely regarded as being [[Principles_of_Tax-Efficient_Fund_Placement | less tax-efficient than stock index funds]] (which rarely sell stock) and should be held in tax-deferred accounts when possible.

If you are in a high tax bracket and without sufficient taxable space, [[Municipal bonds]] are likely the preferred solution; these bonds are not taxed but there is a cost in lower yield. If you are in low tax brackets, you should calculate your after-tax return on taxable bonds in taxable accounts to determine whether or not to use municipal bonds.

==Style boxes==
"Style boxes" are 3&amp;nbsp;x&amp;nbsp;3 grids that categorize securities. Different investment styles have various levels of risk which leads to differences in returns. This visualization allows investors to compare securities using an easy-to-understand standardized format.

Fixed income funds (bonds) classify risk as levels of [[#Credit risk | credit risk]] (credit quality) on the vertical axis, and [[#Interest rate risk | interest rate risk]] (term risk) on the horizontal axis.

There are a number of ways to characterize interest rate risk, such as [[:Bonds: Advanced Topics#Duration | duration]] (sensitivity to changes in interest rates) and various maturity measures. In either case, the objective is to categorize interest rate risk into short-term, intermediate-term, and long-term periods of time.

Morningstar (interest rate sensitivity) and Vanguard (maturity) provide fixed income fund ''style boxes''. Either format can be used to compare funds, but compare using the same methodology. When comparing ''only'' Vanguard funds, Vanguard's style box is valid. Otherwise, if no Vanguard style box is available, use Morningstar's style box for all funds. Vanguard funds will be shown on Morningstar's site using the Morningstar style box.&lt;ref&gt;{{Forum link| p=948589| title=9-style box - Vanguard vs M*t}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stock Basics#Style Boxes | Equity style boxes]] (stock funds) and fixed income style boxes (bond funds) represent two-dimensional (horizontal and vertical axis) views of risk versus return. However, the background behind these boxes is based on very different concepts. '''Only compare stocks-to-stocks and bonds-to-bonds.'''

Both equity and fixed income style boxes are a way to visualize how diversified your portfolio is with respect to the main characteristic of each asset class - size and value for equities; credit risk and term risk for fixed income.&lt;ref&gt;{{Forum link| p=757434| title=Style boxes - Why the differences?

For example, you are interested in Vanguard's balanced funds&lt;ref&gt;[https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/tools/stylebox?View=Fund&amp;Cat=Domestic_Balanced_Balanced Vanguard balanced funds], Vanguard, style boxes&lt;/ref&gt; which contain both stock and bond funds. The style boxes show you a simple collection of colored boxes, and this can make asset allocation decisions easier.

'''Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities''' (TIPS) are one type of the notes and bonds issued by the [https://home.treasury.gov/ U.S. Treasury]. TIPS are unique because their principal and interest payments are indexed to the rate of inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index.

TIPS explicitly protect you from inflation. Other "nominal" bonds do not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/research/indepth/tips/res_tips.htm| publisher=Treasury Direct| title=TIPS In Depth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Notice|[[I savings bonds]] (I Bonds) also protect you from inflation, and are an alternative to TIPS. See [[I Bonds vs TIPS]] for similarities and differences between the the two.}}

== How it works ==
After a TIPS bond is issued, its principal is adjusted daily using the ''Non-Seasonally Adjusted U.S. City Average All Items Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers'' ([https://www.bls.gov/CPI/ CPI-U]). If there is inflation, the adjusted principal goes up. If there is deflation, the adjusted principal goes down.

When the bond matures, the [https://home.treasury.gov/ U.S. Treasury] pays the original or the adjusted principal, whichever is greater. The principal adjustment factor is called the Index Ratio. The adjusted principal is the original principal multiplied by the Index Ratio.

After the CPI-U number is announced for the previous month, the Treasury Department publishes the [https://treasurydirect.gov/instit/annceresult/tipscpi/tipscpi.htm daily index ratios] for the following month. For example, the CPI-U number for May is announced in June. The inflation during the month of May is prorated in the Index Ratios throughout the month of July and reflected fully in the Index Ratio by the end of July. Therefore the inflation adjustment has a lag of two months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/research/indepth/tips/res_tips_rates.htm| publisher=Treasury Direct| title=TIPS Rates &amp; Terms}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like regular bonds, a TIPS bond also pays interest twice a year. The semi-annual interest is calculated by multiplying the adjusted principal by one-half of the interest rate on the bond. For example, if a TIPS bond has a stated interest rate of 2% and the index ratio is 1.035 on the date of the interest payment date, a $1,000 bond will pay interest of

 $1,000 &amp;times; 1.035 &amp;times; 2% / 2 = $10.35

If the index ratio goes to 1.050 on the next interest payment date six months later, the same bond will pay interest of

 $1,000 &amp;times; 1.050 &amp;times; 2% / 2 = $10.50

If the index ratio goes to 0.985 on the next interest payment date another six months later, the same bond will pay interest of

 $1,000 &amp;times; 0.985 &amp;times; 2% / 2 = $9.85

When there is inflation, both the TIPS principal and the interest payments go up with inflation. When there is deflation, both the TIPS principal and the interest payments go down with deflation. On maturity, if the inflation adjusted principal value is below the original face value, the TIPS pays the original face value. 

== Role in a portfolio ==
TIPS belong to the Bonds category. Their role in a portfolio is similar to that of other bonds. Because unexpected inflation is the biggest enemy of fixed income securities and because TIPS offer unique inflation protection, consider including TIPS in your investment portfolio.

A TIPS should work as a good diversifier of equity risk, because it (and the inflation) tends to have slightly negative correlation with equities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.tiaa-cref.org/about/press/publications/market_monitor/2008_08_25.pdf| publisher=TIAA-CREF| title=Inflation-Linked Bonds: Powerful Portfolio Diversifier}}{{dead link}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, even though both conventional treasuries and TIPS should respond to changes in real interest rates, during market crashes or severe recessions, TIPS may not hold up as well as conventional treasuries, at least in the short term&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/102215/3-reasons-stay-away-tips.asp 3 Reasons to Maybe Avoid Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS)]&lt;/ref&gt;.  This could be because conventional US treasuries are often considered a [https://files.stlouisfed.org/files/htdocs/publications/regional/10/07/treasury_securities.pdf flight to safety] during financial uncertainty.  Also, conventional treasuries are more liquid than TIPS&lt;ref&gt;[https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/221/TBACCharge1Q42021.pdf TIPS Supply]&lt;/ref&gt;.

[https://blbarnitz4.wordpress.com/2016/12/04/a-three-fund-portfolio-tailored-for-stable-retirement-spending/#more-4071 TIPS can also be incorporated into a three fund portfolio, instead of nominal bonds].

==TIPS Ladder==
A [https://www.tipsladder.com/ TIPS ladder] is a series of Treasury Inflation Protected Security bonds, purchased with sequential maturities for a specific number of years.  For instance, an investor could purchase a series TIPS maturing in 2025 to 2034, for a 10 year ladder, with each year representing a specific maturity amount, such as $10,000.  Those maturity amounts will increase by inflation each year.  The net result is a fixed period ladder of maturities protected against inflation.  Given TIPS also have a real yield, positive or negative, the face values needed to achieve the desired maturity values can vary.

One example of a TIPS ladder could be creating a ladder for the years between retiring early and eventually drawing social security.  A 60 year old retiree may decide to create a 10 year TIPS ladder until age 70 when they take delayed social security.  The annual ladder amounts could approximate the estimated future social security payments. 

In periods where the real yield on TIPS is significantly positive, a TIPS ladder is a way of guaranteeing an inflation protected cash flow stream with a positive rate of return.

== How to buy ==
The Treasury Department sells TIPS a few times a year through auctions. After the auction, TIPS trade on the secondary market. You can buy TIPS at the time of the auction or you can buy on the secondary market at any time. You can also buy TIPS through a mutual fund or ETF.

=== At auction ===
&lt;!-- '''Note''': ''The Treasury auction process is not unique to TIPS. The following few paragraphs should be moved to a new article about buying Treasury notes at auction.'' --&gt;

If you want to buy TIPS directly from the Treasury, you need to do so during one of their auctions. As of 2019, this is the expected auction schedule (where months marked with an asterisk indicate re-openings of the prior issue):

* '''5-year TIPS''' - April, June*, October, December*
* '''10-year TIPS''' - January, March*, May*, July, September*, November*
* '''30-year TIPS''' - February, August*

The [https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/quarterly-refunding/Documents/auctions.pdf Tentative Treasury Auction Schedule] publishes specific auction dates. A few days before the auction date, the Treasury Department also publishes a formal [https://treasurydirect.gov/instit/annceresult/press/press_secannpr.htm announcement]. The announcement includes details of the security being offered. If it is a new issue, the auction sets both the price and the coupon interest rate. The coupon rate is set to nearest 0.125% below the high yield from the auction. If it is a re-opening, the coupon interest rate is already known. The auction will set the yield which in turn determines the price. This [https://sheet.zoho.com/public.do?docurl=s0%2FmWFqPNrZy0%2FOUr%2FsJjA%3D%3D&amp;name=M0Uaf%2FFaFrhTmtwytaDqkQ%3D%3D online spreadsheet] can help you estimate the dollars needed for buying one bond at auction.

After the announcement date but before the auction cutoff time, retail investors can place auction orders through [https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/indiv.htm TreasuryDirect] or through a brokerage account. [https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/indiv.htm TreasuryDirect] charges no fee but it only handles taxable accounts. If you want to buy in an IRA, you must use a brokerage account, which can also handle taxable accounts. As of September 2023, [https://www.fidelity.com/trading/commissions-margin-rates Fidelity], [https://www.schwab.com/fixed-income/individual-bonds#FixedIncome Schwab], and [[Vanguard_FAQ#Vanguard_Brokerage_Services_.28VBS.29 | Vanguard Brokerage Services]] charge no fee for TIPS auction orders placed online.

After the auction, the Treasury Department makes [https://treasurydirect.gov/instit/annceresult/press/press_auctionresults.htm another announcement] for the auction result. The settlement date is at least one day after the auction date. You must have enough cash available on the settlement date to pay for the bonds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/research/indepth/res_auctions_indepth.htm| publisher=Treasury Direct| title=Auctions In Depth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== On the secondary market ===
You can also buy TIPS at any time on the secondary market through a brokerage account. The prices from the brokers include a markup over what institutions pay for larger trades. Some brokers also charge a separate commission on top of the markup. TreasuryDirect does not handle secondary market purchases; you have to transfer your bonds to a brokerage and sell them there.

The following link shows some current TIPS pricing and real yields available in the secondary market.
*[https://www.wsj.com/market-data/bonds/tips Treasury Inflation Protected Securities: WSJ Markets]

=== Through a mutual fund or ETF ===
Buying TIPS through a mutual fund or ETF gives you a diversified portfolio of TIPS of different maturities. Buying through a mutual fund or ETF also makes it easier for tax reporting and reinvesting interest payments. Because a mutual fund or ETF distributes both the interest income and inflation adjustment of an inflation-indexed bond as income distributions, there are some things you need to be aware of:
#If you want full inflation protection, you need to reinvest inflation adjustment distributions back into the fund.
#The inflation/deflation principal adjustment causes fund dividend distributions to vary considerably.&lt;ref group="note"&gt; You can see an example of this in the early 2009 distributions from the Vanguard Inflation-Protected Securities Fund. The semiannual report contains the following explanation:
{{quotation|
'''Why the fund skipped a dividend'''&lt;br&gt;
The income distributions from Vanguard Inflation-Protected Securities Fund are based on the sum of two factors. One is the real yield at which the fund securities were purchased (the "real purchased yield"). The other is the inflation adjustment to the value of these holdings, which is based on monthly changes in the Consumer Price Index. A rise in the index (inflation) increases the principal value of those holdings. Together with the "real purchased yield," this upward adjustment is distributed as income, as required by the Internal Revenue Service. A decline (deflation) reduces the principal value, partially or fully offsetting the real yield. ... [L]ate 2008 was a period of significantly falling prices, or deflation. The inflation-related adjustments to the value of inflation-indexed securities are made with a two-month lag, so the significant deflation experienced in late 2008 offset all of (a bit more than, in fact) the fund’s "real purchased yield" accrued in the first half of 2009. The inflation rate has since crept into positive territory.|Vanguard Inflation-Protected Securities Fund 2009 Semiannual Report, p.5.}}

== Tax considerations ==
TIPS are not as tax-efficient as their low reported yields indicate. Both the inflation adjustment to principal and the interest payments are taxable as ordinary income for federal income tax. They are tax exempt for state and local income tax. Thus TIPS are as tax-efficient as nominal Treasury bonds with the same combined yield&lt;ref&gt;Excepting for the fact that TIPS inflation adjustment is taxed annually, but is not paid out until maturity.

&lt;/ref&gt;; if inflation is low and the TIPS yields are low, the tax cost will also be low.

If you must hold inflation indexed bonds in a taxable account, you may also consider [[I savings bonds]]; the tax deferral is likely to be worth more than the yield difference. However, if you have maxed out on I Savings Bonds, and need to hold bonds in a taxable account, TIPS tend to have low yields because they have low risk, so they may be reasonable taxable holdings.

If you hold individual TIPS in a taxable account, both the inflation adjustment to principal and the interest payments are taxable as ordinary income for federal income tax, although the bonds do not pay out the inflation adjustment to principal until the maturity date. This problem of paying taxes on income not received until a future date is often referred to as the "[https://tipswatch.com/2021/04/02/frightened-by-a-phantom-tips-are-fine-in-a-taxable-account-until/ phantom income]" problem. You must figure out how to report taxable income on your own using the 1099 forms you receive from [https://treasurydirect.gov/ TreasuryDirect] or your brokerage firm.

If you hold TIPS through a mutual fund or ETF in a taxable account, the mutual fund or ETF will figure out and distribute the taxable income to you as dividends. Tax reporting is similar to other Treasury bond funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/research/indepth/tips/res_tips_tax.htm| publisher=Treasury Direct| title=TIPS: Tax Considerations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Why are the yields sometimes negative?==
TIPS may sometimes report a negative [[Bonds: advanced topics#Yield to maturity|''yield to maturity'']].

A bond's ''yield to maturity'' can be thought of as the interest rate a savings account would have to pay in order for you to end up with the same amount of money at the time the bond matures.&lt;ref name="#Cruncher"&gt;{{forum link| p=1176308| title=Please help me understand Vanguard Inflation-Protected Fund| author=#Cruncher| date=September 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, you buy a [[Nominal bond | nominal bond]] for $1,000 with a 2% coupon paid annually that matures in one year. At that time you'll receive $20 in interest plus $1,000 in principal for a total of $1,020. This is the same as you'd get from a savings account paying 2% compounded annually.

But say that because of market conditions, you'd have to pay $1,005 for the ''same bond''. After one year, you will still receive $1,020. What is the equivalent savings account interest rate? It would be:

:1.49% = ($1,020 / $1,005) - 1

Now assume market conditions are such that the price of the bond is $1,025. What savings account interest rate would make $1,025 "grow" to $1,020 in one year? It would have to be a negative interest rate. In this case:

:-0.49% = ($1,020 / $1,025) - 1

Savings accounts and ''nominal bonds'' rarely pay a negative interest rate.

But, TIPS are more likely to have a negative real ''yield to maturity'' because investors know they will get an additional return to compensate for inflation.

Assume the bond costing $1,025 is a TIPS, and that the [[Consumer price index | CPI]] increases 3% during the year. Investors will get $1,051 = ($1,020 &amp;times; 1.03) a year from now, so they will have a positive nominal return.&lt;ref name="#Cruncher" /&gt;

{{for|additional information|wikipedia:United States Treasury security}}

'''Series I Savings Bonds''' (often called '''I Bonds''') are government savings bonds issued by the U.S. Treasury that offer inflation protection. I Bonds offer tax-deferral for up to 30 years and are free from state and local taxation. I Bonds are not marketable securities and cannot be traded in the secondary market.

Note: [[Treasury Inflation Protected Securities]] (TIPS) also provide inflation protection. TIPS are considered alternatives to I Bonds. See [[I Bonds vs TIPS]] for similarities and differences between the two instruments.

==History==

I bonds were first issued in September, 1998. Historical interest rates, along with computation metrics, for I bond issues can be found at [http://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/research/indepth/ibonds/res_ibonds_iratesandterms.htm TreasuryDirect].

==Rates and terms==
===Composite rate===
I Bonds have two components that make up their composite rate (total yield): a fixed rate and an inflation rate.
* The '''fixed rate''' is fixed for the entire life of any given I Bond. The fixed rate for newly-issued I Bonds is announced on May 1 and November 1 of each year, and applies to all I Bonds issued during that six month period.
* The '''inflation rate''' is based on the Consumer Price Index and is also announced every six months, on May 1 and November 1. The May rate is based on the change in the CPI-U from the previous September to March and the November rate on the change from March to September. This inflation adjustment applies to both existing I Bonds and newly-issued ones, but the timing of that adjustment is dependent on the original issue date of any particular I Bond.

The composite rate can never go below zero, which protects investors in times of deflation.

Interest accrues monthly and compounds semiannually.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treasurydirect.gov/news/pressroom/currenteebondratespr.htm Nov 2009 TreasuryDirect Press Release Announcing the New Rates]&lt;/ref&gt; The accrual date is the first of the month, and the redemption value does not change between accrual dates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/retrieveECFR?gp=1&amp;SID=fb5d179703df8bce0b33b2d270075490&amp;ty=HTML&amp;h=L&amp;n=31y2.1.1.1.55&amp;r=PART#31:2.1.1.1.55.1.17.4 31 CFR 359.3]&lt;/ref&gt; This means that on each 6th month anniversary of the issue date the value of the bond is increased by the interest earned during that 6 month period. However, until the bond is owned for 5 years, the value of the bond is reduced by the latest 3 months worth of interest which is a penalty for selling early. After 5 years of ownership there is no penalty and the full value of interest earned is included in the bond value shown on the Treasury Direct site. An additional restriction is that the bond may not be redeemed until it has been held for 12 months.

===Six-month cycle of composite earnings rates===
I Bond interest is calculated in six month cycles, based on the original date of issue. Each I Bond's composite rate (fixed and inflation) remains in effect for a total of six months, and then changes to a combination of that I Bond's fixed rate plus the most recently announced inflation adjustment for the next six months. That cycle continues for the life of an I Bond:

An example of the composite rate calculation using I bonds issued May 2009 - Oct. 2009:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.savingsbonds.gov/indiv/research/indepth/ibonds/res_ibonds_iratesandterms.htm I Savings Bonds Rates &amp; Terms]&lt;/ref&gt;

:Given a Fixed rate = 0.10% and a Semiannual inflation rate = -2.78%

:Composite rate = [Fixed rate + (2 x Semiannual inflation rate) + (Fixed rate x Semiannual inflation rate)]
:Composite rate = [0.0010 + (2 &amp;times; -0.0278) + (0.0010 &amp;times; -0.0278)]
:Composite rate = [0.0010 + (-0.0556) + (-0.0000278)]
:Composite rate = [-0.0546278]
:Composite rate = -0.0546
:Composite rate = -5.46%
:Composite rate = 0.00% (Composite rates are never less than zero)

===How the formula works===

If the inflation rate during the six months the composite rate applies is the same as the inflation rate from the previous period used in the computation of the composite rate, the pre-tax real return is the fixed rate. Example: assume a fixed rate of 1% and a semi-annual inflation rate of 1.5%. The [[#Composite rate | composite rate]] = [.01 + (2 &amp;times; .015) + (.01 &amp;times; .015)] = .04015. After six months, $1 invested in the I bond is worth 

:(1 + .04015/2) = 1.020075, and what used to cost $1 now costs 1.015 after inflation.

Before, $1 would buy 1.0 item that cost $1. Now you have $1.020075, but the item now costs $1.015. You can now buy

:1.020075/1.015 = 1.005 items, 0.5% more than before.

Your real return for the six months is 0.5%. This produces an annual real return of 1.0% (the fixed rate), compounded every six months (the actual real return after one year is greater than 1.0% because of the compounding).

===How interest is calculated===
All bond values are based on the $25 bond. A $5000 bond is worth 200 times what a $25 bond is worth; a $100 bond is worth 4 times what a $25 bond is worth. If you have a $80 electronic bond at TreasuryDirect, it is worth 3.2 $25 bonds. The $25 bond value is always rounded to the nearest penny. Thus, a $5000 bond must always have a value that is a multiple of $2.00.

Interest is computed on a $25 bond using the composite rate divided by 2 for the given six month period. For individual months within the six month period, interest is computed using pseudo-monthly compounding to produce the same result after six months. For example, if the composite rate is 2.57%, the bond value after

:1 month&amp;nbsp; is $25 &amp;times; (1 + 0.0257/2)^(1/6) = $25.05, and after
:4 months is $25 &amp;times; (1 + 0.0257/2)^(4/6) = $25.21, and after
:6 months is $25 &amp;times; (1 + 0.0257/2)^(6/6) = $25.32.

The values of a $100 bond would be $100.20, $100.84, and $101.28 after those same time periods. Note that this ignores the 3 month penalty for redemption within the first 5 years and the restriction on redemption within the first year.

===Current interest rates and I Bond value===
To find out the current interest rate of I Bonds and the worth of your bonds, the following resources of [http://www.savingsbonds.gov/tdhome.htm TreasuryDirect] may be used:
* [http://www.savingsbonds.gov/indiv/research/indepth/ibonds/res_ibonds_iratesandterms.htm I Savings Bonds Rates and Terms]
* [http://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/tools/tools_savingsbondcalc.htm Savings Bond Calculator]
* [http://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/tools/tools_savingsbondwizard.htm Savings Bond Wizard]

The website [https://www.eyebonds.info/ibonds/home10000.html eyebonds.info] can also be useful to determine the interest rate and worth of your bonds based on when they are purchased.

==Purchase and redemption==
===Who can own I Bonds===
Savings bonds may be owned not only by individuals, but by ''entities'', such as trusts, estates of deceased persons, living estates [where a court has appointed a guardian for a person, such as one who is incompetent], corporations, and partnerships.&lt;ref name="register"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/research/indepth/ibonds/registeringibonds.htm| title=Registering a Savings Bond: Series I | publisher=TreasuryDirect| accessdate=July 19, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individual adults can buy savings bonds for children under the age of 18 and register the bonds in the name of a child or children.&lt;ref name="register" /&gt;

Entities are permitted to open accounts in TreasuryDirect. An entity account must be opened by an individual (known as the entity account manager) who can legally act alone when managing the account on behalf of the entity or organization.&lt;ref name="entity"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/help/TDHelp/help_ug_292-EntityAccountsLearnMore.htm| title=Learn More About Entity Accounts | publisher=TreasuryDirect| accessdate=July 19, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The references to "you" and "your" in this article refer to the primary account holder, which can be an individual or an entity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?cb&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se31.2.363_16&amp;rgn=div8| title=§363.6 What special terms do I need to know to understand this part? | publisher= Electronic Code of Federal Regulations (e-CFR) |series= 31 CFR §363.6 |quote= ''You or your'' refers to a TreasuryDirect primary account holder. | accessdate=July 19, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Direct purchase===
I Bonds are sold at face value; for example, you would pay $100 for a $100 I Bond. I Bonds are not marketable securities, meaning that, unlike other bonds and stocks, you cannot trade I Bonds in the secondary market.
* '''Electronic I Bonds''' - You can buy electronic I Bonds at [http://www.savingsbonds.gov/indiv/indiv.htm TreasuryDirect]. Purchases may be made in amounts of $25 or more, to the penny.
* '''Purchase limits''' - $10,000 maximum purchase in one calendar year, with an additional $5,000 in paper I Bonds per Social Security number using your IRS tax refund.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/research/indepth/ebonds/res_e_bonds_eecomparison.htm I and EE Savings Bond Comparison], from TreasuryDirect.gov.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* '''Paper I Bonds''' - Paper I Bonds may be replaced if they were lost, stolen, mutilated, or never received.&lt;ref group="note" name="Replace"&gt;The process for replacing paper I bonds can be found at TreasuryDirect.gov: [https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/research/indepth/ibonds/res_ibonds_ireplace.htm Individual - Replacing or Reissuing a Paper I Bond]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gifts===
Savings bonds purchased as gifts are not included in your annual purchase limit.&lt;ref name="TreasDirect"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/research/articles/res_invest_articles_purchaselimits_0406.htm| title=Purchase Limits | publisher=TreasuryDirect| accessdate=July 19, 2021}} and {{cite web| url=https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?mc=true&amp;node=se31.2.363_152&amp;rgn=div8| title=§363.52 What is the principal amount of book-entry Series EE and Series I savings bonds that I may acquire in one year? | publisher= Electronic Code of Federal Regulations (e-CFR) |series= 31 CFR §363.52 | accessdate=July 19, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Savings bonds received as gifts are applied to the receiver's annual purchase limit in the year the transaction occurs (when they are delivered to the recipient).&lt;ref name="TreasDirect" /&gt;

Savings bonds purchased as gifts begin accruing interest the month they are purchased and will have a maturity date 30 years after the purchase month. 

In order to purchase savings bonds as a gift, you will need to know the recipient’s Social Security Number. This allows you to register the individual and purchase the bonds, placing them into your Gift Box in Treasury Direct. There is a waiting period of 5 business days for the funds to clear. After the funds clear, they may be transferred to the recipient using their Treasury Direct account number.

'''Example 1:''' Your aunt buys $10k of I bonds as a gift for you in December 2020. She delivers the gift to you in January 2021. You have now acquired $10k of I bonds in 2021. You are not allowed to buy even $1 worth of I bonds for yourself, although you could buy $100k worth as gifts for others.

'''Example 2:''' You purchase $10k of I bonds as a gift for your spouse on October 15, 2022. The bond will begin accruing interest in October 2022 but remain in your Gift Box until you manually deliver the bond from your account. The bond will have an Issue Date of 10-01-2022 and Maturity Date of 10-01-2052.

===Conversion===
If you have paper I Bonds, you may convert any or all of these paper bonds to electronic bonds. This conversion does ''not'' apply to your annual purchase limit of $10,000 in electronic I-Bonds (see quote on the side from the IRS website).
{{Quote
|quote = '''Conversion'''
"There is no limit on how many previously-issued paper bonds can be converted to electronic securities in your TreasuryDirect account in a single year."

'''Redeem Bonds'''

"To redeem electronic bonds purchased in ''TreasuryDirect'', log in and follow the on-screen directions. Your checking or savings account will be credited with the redemption amount within one business day of the redemption date.

You can cash your I Bonds at most local financial institutions. Treasury doesn’t maintain a listing of local banks that redeem bonds, so check with the banks in your area. When you present the bonds, you’ll be asked to establish your identity. You can do this by:

* Being a customer with an active account open for at least 6 months at the financial institution that will be paying the bonds, or
* Presenting documentary identification, such as a driver's license.

If you're not listed as the owner or co-owner on the bonds you're redeeming, you'll have to establish that you're entitled to redeem the bonds. It's always a good idea to check with your financial institution before presenting the bonds for payment to find out what identification and other documents you need. "

[http://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/research/indepth/ibonds/res_ibonds_iredeem.htm Treasury Direct:Redeem I Savings Bonds]}}
===Redemption===
I Bonds cannot be redeemed during the first year, and if you redeem them within the first five years after purchase, you lose the most recent three months' interest. When you redeem your I Bonds, you can never get back less than you invested, even if there was a long period of negative inflation (deflation).

==Tax benefits==
===Tax-deferred growth===

Interest from I Bonds accumulates tax-deferred for up to 30 years. (I Bonds do not distribute interest like CDs and other bonds do.) After 30 years, the I Bonds reach final maturity and no longer earn any additional interest. When I Bonds mature or are redeemed, the interest is taxable income for federal income tax purposes, but is free from state and local taxation. However, if the entire proceeds of the I Bond redemption (both principal and interest) are used for qualifying educational expenses, the interest can be tax-free at the federal level (see below). You also have the choice of paying income taxes on the accrued interest each year (which may be advantageous if a bond is titled in a child's name). 

Both "redemption" and "maturity" of savings bonds are taxable events, whichever occurs first is when the bond is taxed.&lt;ref&gt; According to [https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/research/indepth/ibonds/res_ibonds_itaxconsider.htm Series I Savings Bonds Tax Considerations].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tax-free growth for qualified education expenses===

If I Bonds are redeemed for qualifying education expenses, the interest is completely tax free, provided certain conditions are met.

====Conditions====
According to [http://www.irs.gov/publications/p970/ch10.html Publication 970 (2009), Tax Benefits for Education], the tax-free redemption requires the following conditions to be met:

* You pay qualified educational expenses for yourself, your spouse, or a dependent for whom you claim an exemption on your return.
* Your modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) is less than $84,950 for single taxpayers ($134,900 if married filing jointly or qualifying widow(er)). The amount of your interest exclusion is gradually reduced (phased out) if your modified adjusted gross income is between $69,950 and $84,950 (between $104,900 and $134,900 if your filing status is married filing jointly or qualifying widow(er)). You cannot exclude any of the interest if your modified adjusted gross income is equal to or more than the upper limit.The phaseout, if any, is figured for you when you fill out [http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f8815.pdf Form 8815]. The MAGI numbers are adjusted annually.
* Your filing status is not married filing separately.
* The owner of the Savings Bonds must be at least 24 years old before the bond's issue date. (The issue date is printed on the front of the Savings Bond.)
* The full proceeds of the savings bond redemption (both interest and principal) must be used for qualifying educational expenses.

====529 plans====
Note that redeeming I Bonds to contribute to a [[529 plan]] or a [[Coverdell Education Savings Accounts (ESAs)|Coverdell education savings account]] is also considered a qualified educational expense. To take advantage of this, file IRS [http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f8815.pdf Form 8815] to claim an exclusion for the interest after rolling the proceeds of these US Savings Bonds into a section 529 college savings plan or Coverdell Education Savings account. Write "529 College Savings Plan" or "Coverdell Education Savings Account" in the answer to 1(b), where it asks for the name of the educational institution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finaid.org/savings/529plans.phtml#Contributions FinAid Section 529 Plans]&lt;/ref&gt;. Note that there are certain restrictions, such as the fact that the child beneficiary cannot be listed as a co-owner on the bonds. See [http://www.irs.gov/publications/p970/ch10.html Publication 970 (2009), Tax Benefits for Education] for more details.

====Modified AGI limits====
As of 2013, for all other filing statuses, your interest exclusion is phased out if your modified AGI is between $72,850 and $87,850 (filing single) or between $109,250 and $139,250 (married filing jointly)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/planning/plan_education.htm Education Planning], from TreasuryDirect.&lt;/ref&gt;. You cannot take the exclusion if your modified AGI is above those limits. You are disqualified from the interest exclusion if you are married filing separately. For more information, see chapter 11 in Publication 970, Tax Benefits for Education.

If you expect to be above the MAGI levels the following year, it may be prudent to use I-Bonds for qualified educational expenses (such as using them to fund a 529 plan) in the current year, to avoid paying taxes on the interest.

==Role in a portfolio==

* If your tax-advantaged accounts are filled up with bond funds, you can "extend" your tax-advantaged accounts by purchasing I Bonds in your taxable account. This process is somewhat similar, but not identical, to placing Treasury Inflation Protected Securities in your [[Non-deductible Traditional IRA]]. Buying I Bonds in your taxable account is particularly useful if your tax bracket is too low to justify owning tax-exempt bonds in your taxable account.
* If you are desperately looking for tax-advantaged space to hold tax-inefficient assets like REITs, you can free up some of your tax-advantaged space by purchasing I Bonds in your taxable account and then exchanging a part of the bond allocation in your tax-advantaged account to a REIT fund.
* If you have a tax-free growth account like a Roth IRA, but no tax-deferred account like a Traditional IRA, you may want to place stocks in the Roth IRA while buying I Bonds in your taxable account to make the maximum use of the tax-free growth in the Roth IRA.
* I-bonds older than 1 year can serve as an emergency fund if you can absorb the 3-month interest penalty; otherwise I-bonds at least 5 years old serve as an emergency fund just fine. The yield can at times be higher than money market funds or bank savings accounts.

==Caveats==
===Redemption while in a high tax bracket===

I Bonds redeemed when the investor is in a high tax bracket may provide little or no positive after-tax, after-inflation return, especially if they are held for shorter periods of time. For this reason, if you expect to be in a high tax bracket when you redeem your I Bonds, they may not be a suitable investment for you. Specifically, if you are in your 20s, in 30 years you may well be in your peak earning years, which means you would probably be in a high tax bracket when the bonds mature.

To illustrate the point, here is the after-tax, after-inflation value of $1 invested in I bonds compounded for 30 years (60 semi-annual periods) with 3% inflation and a 1% fixed rate and then redeemed in the 35% federal income tax bracket:

:(1 + ((1 + 0.04015/2)^60 - 1) &amp;times; (1 - 0.35)) / (1.03^30) = $1.02671191
:where 0.04015 is the [[#Composite rate | composite rate]] (.01 + (2 &amp;times; .015) + (.01 &amp;times; .015) = .04015) and 0.0415/2 is the rate that is compounded every 6 months (60 times in 30 years)

This is equivalent to a real after-tax return of 0.088%/year.

==Tips for buying I Bonds==
Since I Bonds earn the full month's interest if you own them on the last day of that month, it is generally a good idea to buy I Bonds at the end of a month after also earning interest on that same money in a bank account during most of that same month. Conversely, you would want to redeem your I Bonds at the beginning of any month, since holding them until later in the month will not earn any additional interest, unless you own them on the last day of the month.

== Market price fluctuation ==
After TIPS are issued, they can be bought and sold on the secondary market. If the real interest rate goes down, the previously-issued TIPS with higher real rates go up in value. They can be sold on the secondary market for their true market value. Since there is no secondary market for I-Bonds, they can only be redeemed at accrued value from the U.S. Treasury. If you have high fixed rate I-Bonds, your best option would probably be to hold on to them until maturity. '''Advantage: TIPS'''.

On the other hand, if the real interest rate goes up, I-Bonds can be redeemed at accrued value anytime after you've held them for at least 12 months (you'd lose the last three months' interest if redeemed prior to five years), while TIPS go down in value. '''Advantage: I-Bonds'''.

== Pricing transparency ==
The TIPS prices (and yields) are set by the market. The I-Bonds fixed rates are set by the U.S. Treasury. As the bond issuer, the U.S. Treasury has an incentive to set the fixed rates on I-Bonds as low as they feel they can to still reach their desired sales goals. Investors do not necessarily get a competitive yield from I-Bonds. '''Advantage: TIPS'''.
 
== Purchase limits and fees ==
There is no practical limit for purchasing TIPS. I-Bonds are limited to $10,000 in TreasuryDirect  per Social Security number and $5,000 in paper bonds purchased with IRS tax refund. TIPS can also be purchased through a mutual fund. I-Bonds cannot be bought through a mutual fund. TIPS can be bought in an IRA. I-Bonds cannot be bought in an IRA (they are already tax-deferred). '''Advantage: TIPS'''.

There is no fee for purchasing I-Bonds. There is no fee for purchasing TIPS at auction from TreasuryDirect or through certain brokerage firms if the order is placed online. As of May 2008, Fidelity&lt;ref&gt;[http://personal.fidelity.com/products/trading/Commissions_Margin_Rates/Commissions_Margin_Rates_Bonds.shtml.cvsr Fidelity Online Bond Trade Concessions]&lt;/ref&gt; and Schwab&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schwab.com/public/schwab/home/fees_commissions/commission_schedule?refid=P-1357516&amp;refpid=P-1357507#FixedIncome Schwab Fixed Income Commissions]&lt;/ref&gt; charge no fee for auction orders placed online. Vanguard Brokerage Services&lt;ref&gt; [https://personal.vanguard.com/us/accounttypes/general/ATSBrokerageAcctFeesContent.jsp Vanguard Brokerage Services Account fees and commissions]&lt;/ref&gt; charges $10 for online auction orders unless you are a Voyager client or higher. All brokers charge a markup for secondary market orders.  If you hold a TIPS mutual fund, you will pay a management fee; Vanguard charges 0.20%, and 0.11% for Admiral shares.  '''Advantage: I-Bonds'''.

== Inflation adjustment ==
I-Bonds are adjusted for inflation every six months. TIPS are adjusted for inflation every day. '''Advantage: TIPS'''.

== Interest accrual and payments ==
Interest on I-Bonds is accrued until the bonds are redeemed. TIPS pay out interest every six months. Whether one is better than another depends on whether the investor needs the interest payment or not.

== Tax treatment ==
I-Bonds are tax deferred. Taxes are due in the year in which the I-Bonds are redeemed, unless the investor elects to pay tax on the interests every year.   If the I-Bonds are used to pay educational expenses, the interest may be fully or partially tax-free, depending on your income&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p970.pdf IRS Publication 970, Tax Benefits for Education]&lt;/ref&gt;.  Interest payments and inflation adjustments on TIPS are taxable every year. For this reason, it is often suggested that investors hold TIPS in a tax-deferred account. There is no practical way to hold I-Bonds in a tax deferred account. '''Advantage: I-Bonds'''.

==A note on negative real rates ==
The fixed rate component of both TIPS and I-Bonds is based on real interest rates, which are normally positive. Real interest rates can sometimes go negative, however. When real interest rates are negative, the fixed rate on TIPS is also negative.

However, the fixed rate component of the I-Bond has a floor at 0% and cannot go negative. This is a large advantage of I-Bonds when purchasing during a period of negative real interest rates. You can view current levels of real interest rates [http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/Pages/TextView.aspx?data=realyield here]. '''Advantage: I-Bonds'''

==Pricing a bond==
Bond prices are influenced by the credit quality of the issuer as well as marketplace changes in required yield. There is a third factor- the price change of the bond itself over time. Please refer to the [[Bond pricing | bond pricing]] article for details. [[Bond pricing | Bond pricing]] also discusses:
*Basics of the Price/Yield curve
*Selling at discount or premium
*Dirty and clean prices

More in depth discussions can be found at [http://www.investopedia.com/university/advancedbond/advancedbond2.asp investopedia] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_valuation Wikipedia].

==Yield to maturity==
The '''yield to maturity''' of a bond is the interest rate that would be required on an investment of the current price of the bond in order to receive all future scheduled payment (held to maturity).  This is the yield which is quoted in bond pricing reports, and the average yield of all a bond fund's holdings, minus expenses, is the quoted yield of the bond fund.  When a bond price falls, its yield rises, since you can get the same future payments by investing a lower amount at a higher interest rate. 

For example, consider a bond which has a $10,000 face value and pays $500 annually until maturity, then pays back the $10,000 principal.  If the bond price remains $10,000, the yield to maturity remains 5%.  But if the bond price drops to $9,653 four years before maturity, the yield to maturity rises to 6%, as you could get $500, $500, $500, and $10,500 over the next four years by investing $9,653 at 6% interest.

When a bond is downgraded, its price falls because the future payments are less likely to be made, and its yield rises to compensate.  This is why [[High yield bonds |high yield bonds]] have their high yields.

Calculation of [[Bond yield | bond yield]] can be done with a spreadsheet or calculator. Please refer to the [[Bond yield | bond yield]] article to calculate ''yield to maturity'' for:
*Dirty and clean prices
*Zero coupon bonds
*Settlement dates in-between coupon dates
Also in the [[Bond yield | bond yield]] article:
*Current Yield
*Bond Equivalent Yield (BEY)

==Yield curves==
The '''yield curve''' is a plot of bond yields (usually Treasury yields) against years to maturity.  Usually, the curve has an upward slope; long-term bonds have higher yields than short-term bonds as compensation for the increased interest-rate and inflation risk.  

When the curve is steep, investors receive a large premium for taking the greater interest-rate and inflation risks associated with long-term bonds.  When the curve is flat, long-term bonds and short-term bonds have the same current yields.  Sometimes, the curve may even be inverted, with higher yields on short-term bonds than on long-term bonds; this means that the market expects short-term rates to fall, so that a two-year bond reinvested five times is still expected to earn less in ten years than a ten-year bond.

==Duration==
Bond prices [[Bond basics#Interest rate risk | fluctuate]] in [[Bond basics#Bonds on the secondary market | response to]] market interest rate changes.  The '''duration''' of a bond, or a bond fund, is a measure of its sensitivity to interest rates.  The duration is '''approximately the amount by which the price of the bond will fall for every 1% rise in interest rates'''. For example, a bond with a duration value of 5 years would be expected to lose 5% of its market value if interest rates rose by 1%.

This is only approximately correct because of convexity (see below).  A bond fund with a ten-year duration is twice as sensitive to interest-rate risk as a bond fund with a five-year duration.  (In practice, the relative risk is somewhat reduced because long-term rates are usually less volatile than short-term rates.)

The '''formal definition of duration''' is the average value of the time to each future payment, weighted by the proportion of the present value of the bond made up by the present value of each future payment.  A [[zero-coupon bond]] is a promise to make a single payment at a future time, so its duration is equal to its maturity--the time until that payment is made.  A conventional bond, or bond portfolio, or bond fund, makes multiple payments; each payment has a present value and a duration as if it were a zero-coupon bond, and the average of all durations is weighted by the present value of the payments divided by the present value of the whole bond.  A bond which pays coupons will always have duration less than its maturity.  High interest rates make the duration much shorter than the maturity, since a greater proportion of the bond's total value comes sooner.  In low interest rate environments, coupon-paying bonds more closely resemble zero-coupon bonds (duration is closer to the maturity), since the present value of the principal returned at maturity is generally much larger than the coupon payments.

Duration has another useful summary property, which is that if the yield curve shifts in parallel&lt;ref group="note"&gt;A parallel shift is when the long-term and short-term rates increase/decrease by the same amount. In other words, the yield curve moves uniformly across the whole range. Imagine you have a 10-year bond, with a yield curve that pays out 5% for bonds &gt;8 years and 4% for bonds &lt;8 years, and 3% for money market rates. Now, all of a sudden the interest rates rise to (6% &gt;8 years, 5% &lt;8 years, 3% money market rate is unchanged). This is a non-parallel shift of the yield curve, since everything didn't go up by the same amount.&lt;/ref&gt;, then duration is the '''point of indifference to interest rate changes'''.  For example, if a bond/portfolio/fund with a duration of 5 years experiences a market interest rate increase of 1%, its value will drop by approximately 5%; however, since the same coupon payment now represents a higher percentage of the bond's value, its yield is higher (it will match the market rate), and the higher yield plus higher market interest on coupon payments compensate for the NAV loss.  Thus duration represents the length of time it would take for the total value of the fund, with dividends reinvested, to be worth exactly what it would have been worth had interest rates not risen.  To be absolutely assured of receiving a given sum on a future date (assuming parallel shifts of the yield curve), therefore, you should gradually reduce the duration as the date approaches.  A zero-coupon bond reduces duration by exactly the amount of time that passes, and is therefore the risk-less choice for meeting a future obligation.  However, few investors have such exact demands on their capital.  For most purposes, shifting from intermediate- or longer-term bonds to shorter-term bonds as the need for capital approaches will cause little risk; also, in practice non-parallel shifts of the yield curve are not likely to cause very large changes in returns.

Bonds and bond funds also compute an '''effective duration''' which takes into account the possibility that the bond will be called (paid back early).

==Convexity==
Duration is just one number, and cannot completely describe the relationship between bond prices and interest rates, as they are not a straight line; a bond which rises in price by 0.5% for a 0.1% fall in interest rates may not rise by 5% for a 1% fall in interest rates.  '''Convexity''' is a description of how the price moves away from the linear relation; a bond with ''positive convexity'' will be worth more than given by the linear relation if interest rates change significantly (in either direction), while a bond with ''negative convexity'' will be worth less.  Effectively, a bond with positive convexity increases in duration when interest rates fall (and thus the price rises more from the rate fall than would be indicated by the duration) and decreases in duration when interest rates rise (and thus the price falls less from the rate rise).  A bond with negative convexity increases in duration when interest rates rise and decreases in duration when interest rates fall.

Simple bonds, with no call or prepayment features, have positive convexity.  If a bond is likely to be called, it has negative convexity, because the issuer will redeem it at the call price if interest rates have fallen enough to make it worth more than that price.  Callable [[High yield bonds |high yield bonds]] often have considerable negative convexity; if the bonds improve to investment grade, the interest rates will fall considerably but the issuer will call them and investors will not get the full benefit of the rate decrease.

[[Mortgage-backed security | Mortgage-backed securities]] have considerable negative convexity because homeowners can refinance their mortgages.  If interest rates fall, more homeowners will refinance, and the mortgage-backed securities will pay back the principal on the refinanced loans, which did not rise with the fall in interest rates.  Bondholders can reinvest the returned principal, but they reinvest it at the current (lower) rate and do not benefit from the fall in interest rates.  

Given two bonds with the same duration, credit risk, and yield, the bond with higher convexity will always be worth at least as much and may be worth more.  Therefore, investors demand higher yields for bonds with negative convexity; this is why yields on GNMA mortgage-backed securities are higher than on Treasury bonds  even though GNMAs are also backed by the full faith and credit of the US government.  Vanguard even warns about this risk when it quotes the yield on the [{{Vf | 0036}} Vanguard GNMA Fund].

There is a common belief (promoted by Suze Orman, among others) that [[#Why thinking of individual bond principal return as "safe" is misleading | owning individual bonds is less risky]] than a bond fund, but this is not necessarily true if an appropriate bond fund or collection of funds is chosen.

[[#Duration | Duration]] is an essential attribute for understanding the riskiness of a fund or ladder over time. There is also an important distinction between owning a ladder of individual bonds designed to meet specific future liabilities, and [[#Rolling vs. non-rolling bond ladders | holding a rolling bond ladder]].

== An apparent contradiction ==
Annette Thau, Ph.D. is a former municipal bond analyst who has written about the differences between bond funds and individual bonds:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Annette Thau| title=The Bond Book| edition=2nd| pages=238-239| isbn=978-0-07-135862-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{blockquote|While you can invest in any sector of the bond market either through a bond fund or by buying individual bonds, the two are radically different investments.&lt;br&gt;
The main difference is that an individual bond has a definite maturity date and a fund does not. If you hold a bond to maturity, on that date it will be redeemed at par, regardless of the level of interest rates prevailing on the bond’s maturity date. Assuming a default has not occurred, you get back 100% of your principal. You have also earned a predictable income for the period that you have held the bond, consisting of coupon interest and, if coupons were reinvested, of interest-on-interest.}}

Annette Thau outlined the [[#Why thinking of individual bond principal return as "safe" is misleading | three sources of bond return]], and also outlined the framework for her comparison of individual bonds and bond funds: that of a [[#Rolling vs. non-rolling bond ladders | non-rolling ladder]] of individual bonds over a fixed time period.

While the principal and coupon interest are predictable, the interest-on-interest is not. 

=== The interest-on-interest dilemma ===

To see why interest-on-interest is not predictable, consider your situation as an individual investor who has just purchased a five-year bond. Six months in, your bond pays its first coupon. Excited, you run to the mailbox and pick up the check. But now you have a dilemma: what to do with your newfound riches?

You could buy that shiny new iPad you have been craving, but this was investment money; money that you either had socked away for 5 years from now when the bond matures or (more likely) for an indefinite period in the future, such as retirement. Moreover, if you do not reinvest the interest, you will not get the full annualized yield that made you so excited to buy the bond in the first place. So, you decide to reinvest the coupon payment.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;In theory, you may not get the full annualized yield back. See the [[Talk:Individual bonds vs a bond fund#interest-on-interest discussion a bit misleading?|Discussion tab]] for a detailed explanation.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Your next decision is where to put the money. You can place it in a bank account, but extremely liquid riskless investments like bank accounts generally pay considerably less than investments where you have committed to locking up the money for some time in the future, like bonds or [[certificate of deposit]]s (CDs).

If you buy a bond/CD, you have another decision to make. Do you want to buy another 5-year bond? In doing so you will have constructed not the non-rolling ladder of our current scenario but rather a rolling ladder which we will discuss further down the page. Or do you want to buy a 4.5-year bond (and, with the next coupon payment, a 4 year bond, then a 3.5, then a 3, etc. etc.)? Then you will have constructed a non-rolling ladder, with the bonds purchased with the coupon payments yielding less and less as time goes by because their maturities are shorter and shorter.

Whatever you decide to do with the coupon payment, the interest you receive on the coupon interest (the "interest-on-interest") is uncertain. If you put the coupon money in a bank account, the interest rate varies every day. If you put the coupon money in a bond, because the date you are buying a bond is not the same as the date you bought the main bond, you are subject to current market rates.

=== NAV fluctuations ===
Annette Thau continues:
{{blockquote|Bond funds are comprised of a great many issues. While a number of individual issues may remain in the portfolio until they mature, there is no single date at which the entire portfolio of the fund will mature. In fact, most bond funds maintain a "constant" maturity. For example, the maturity of a long-term bond fund will always remain long term, somewhere between 15 and 25 years. The maturity of a short term bond fund, on the other hand, will always be short, that is, somewhere between one and three years. Consequently, unlike an individual bond, the NAV of a fund does not automatically return to par on a specified date.&lt;br&gt;
As a result, the price at which you will be able to sell shares of a bond fund cannot be known ahead of time. It will be determined by conditions prevailing in that sector of the bond market when you sell your fund.}} 

She goes on to say:
{{blockquote|Another way of looking at this difference is that, if you own an individual bond, each year its market value (its price) moves one year closer to par. But because it has a constant maturity the NAV of a bond fund follows interest rates. For that reason, its future is not predictable.&lt;br&gt;
Because the price of a bond fund does not return to par at a specified maturity date, it cannot quote a yield-to-maturity. As a result, any comparison between the potential return of an individual bond and a bond fund is imprecise. You are comparing apples to oranges.}}

This is not to say that a proper bond fund cannot be used to achieve the same goal as a portfolio of individual bonds with approximately the same risk. The key is her statement that future returns, given constant maturity (more precisely, constant duration) are unknowable, whereas with a declining maturity they can be reasonably well-predicted.

=== Declining vs. constant duration ===

==== Methods of achieving declining vs. constant duration ====

What kinds of tools produce a declining duration?
* An individual bond, with coupons reinvested in some form that is liquid on the bond's date of maturity (for example, a bank account, bonds with shorter and shorter maturities as described above, or CDs with put options)
* A [[zero-coupon bond]], which does not pay out a coupon so that no reinvesting of coupons is required.
* A portfolio of individual bonds, purchased with shorter and shorter maturities. Also known as a [[#Rolling vs. non-rolling bond ladders | non-rolling bond ladder]]
* A target-date bond fund. These are rare funds and tend to have very high expense ratios. We will therefore not consider them further.

What kinds of tools produce a constant duration?
* A portfolio of individual bonds, set up such that when one bond matures another bond of equal maturity is purchased. Also known as a [[#Rolling vs. non-rolling bond ladders | rolling bond ladder]].
* A bond fund, where a manager maintains the portfolio to have a fairly constant duration.

==== Reasons for choosing declining or constant duration ====

Assuming the hassles and expenses associated with each were about the same...

Why would you choose a declining duration portfolio/fund?
* You have a known expense at a future date that you want to set money aside for. Examples include saving for a car, or for some investors, college.

Why would you choose a constant duration portfolio/fund?
* You are saving for expenses with unknown amounts and/or unknown time horizons. Examples include retirement, saving for a house down payment, or for some investors, college.

== A framework for comparing portfolios of individual bonds to bond funds ==

Many, if not most, Bogleheads and other investors use bonds as part of a larger portfolio because of their stabilizing properties on the whole portfolio (in this context, the proper framework for analysis is its historical long-term returns as an [[asset class]], its risks, and its relation to the rest of the portfolio). However, the comparison of bond funds to individual bonds seems less controversial in this context. Therefore this page focuses on the scenario where a fixed, known, future obligation needs to be satisfied.

It is unfortunate that this should be the comparison, as the proper instrument for satisfying such an obligation is a zero-coupon bond, as shall be seen. Nevertheless, it is the scenario which most often comes up in discussion about individual bonds vs. funds. Perhaps the most reasonable argument for using this scenario as the comparison is that, even with long-term investing as part of a diversified investment portfolio of stocks and bonds, at some point you will want to spend the portfolio on the goals for which it was accumulated, and at that point the scenario applies.

What matters is total return, not the return of any one component such as the principal which is often focused on in isolation. Total return has three components:
* Principal
* Interest (coupon payments)
* Interest-on-interest (reinvested coupon payments)

We will discuss what happens to the fund or bond after a single interest-rate change. However, as long as the duration of the portfolio is kept approximately equal to the remaining time horizon, then this single interest rate change generalizes to all interest rate changes. For instance, suppose you purchase a portfolio of bonds or funds with 5-year duration to meet a goal 5 years in the future, and properly rebalance it to keep the duration equal to the investment horizon. With 4 years remaining, a parallel shift of the yield curve occurs.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;For a definition of yield curve shift, see: {{forum link| t=51072| title=Bond fund duration, yield curve}}&lt;/ref&gt; You would be indifferent to that interest rate change because of duration matching. If six months later interest rates change again, you also do not care, because your duration is now 3.5 years and so you are similarly indifferent.

This makes clear a key fact often omitted in the financial advice literature. You cannot apply the recommendation to "keep your duration equal to your need for the money" once and then forget it, but must instead update it continuously (or more realistically, by rebalancing every 3-12 months into shorter-term funds). The only way to achieve duration matching automatically is to purchase a zero-coupon bond. Neither individual bonds nor funds will do this perfectly, although individual bonds come closer (particularly in low-interest rate environments). 

Note that the scenario of rebalancing bond funds or portfolios of individual bonds to meet a known, fixed, future obligation is a bit silly. If you have such an obligation, the safest course of action is to purchase neither a fund nor an individual coupon-paying bond, but instead to purchase a zero-coupon bond maturing on the date needed. Nevertheless, it illustrates the point that your money is safe, as will be elaborated in the rest of this page.

=== Rolling vs. non-rolling bond ladders ===
{{Main|Laddering bonds or CDs}}
If you need to satisfy date-certain future liabilities, a non-rolling ladder of individual bonds is superior to a bond fund. For example, if you commit to make a $10,000 a year payment to a charity for five years, the most effective way to invest for that is to buy 5 zero-coupon bonds, one maturing each year. A non-rolling bond ladder matches cash flows to liabilities, which immunizes a portfolio against interest rate shifts.

However, most bond ladders are "rolling", because they are not designed to deal with date-certain future liabilities. They are created with a specific average duration, and when the oldest bond comes due, a new long-dated bond is purchased to replace it. A rolling ladder of this kind can and should be directly compared with a bond fund using the [[#Major Factors | criteria]] below. According to Vanguard in their [[Individual_Bonds_vs_a_Bond_Fund#Links | paper]] ''Taxable bond investing: Bond funds or individual bonds?'', "The total return of a laddered account with characteristics identical to those of an open-end bond fund will deviate from the fund’s return only by the transaction and operational cost differentials."

As advocated by [[Zvi Bodie]], some people aim to fund their retirement by purchasing a ladder of individual TIPS with durations of 1 to 30 years. The idea is to avoid the volatility of the underlying bonds by always holding them to maturity, so as to avoid having to sell the fund at moments when high yields have caused the NAV to drop.

If you are planning to reinvest (that is, rollover) some of the annual redemption into new individual TIPS bonds, then you have gained nothing by using a rolling ladder over a fund. Because not rolling over the whole bond at the (hypothetically) very high yield has an identical opportunity cost to selling a portion of your fund at the (hypothetically) very low NAV. Another issue with this approach is how to deal with the longevity risk if you outlive your ladder.

Consequently, the distinction between a non-rolling ladder (designed to meet date-certain future liabilities) and a rolling ladder (which essentially represents a personal bond fund) is much more important than the difference between a rolling ladder and a bond fund.

== Rolling ladders and funds are similar ==

It has been regularly argued on the [http://www.bogleheads.org Bogleheads forum] that a bond fund is risky because of [[NAV]] fluctuations. For example, the [[NAV]] for [{{Vf | 0119}} Vanguard Inflation Protected Securities] fell 20.4% from peak to trough in 2008. Instead, it is said, investors should hold individual bonds, which can always be redeemed at face value by holding until maturity.

However, the value of individual bonds held in a personal portfolio fluctuates just as the NAV of a bond fund fluctuates. You can see this by looking at the daily price changes of individual bonds online at [https://fixedincome.fidelity.com/ftgw/fi/FILanding Fidelity's fixed income site]. You can also find bond prices online through [https://personal.vanguard.com/us/FixedIncomeHome Vanguard's Bond Desk]. The daily fluctuation of the price of an individual bond will be similar to a bond fund ''if their duration is the same''.

== Non-rolling ladders vs funds ==

A non-rolling ladder (or a single bond) will behave differently than a bond fund over time. This is because a bond fund (usually) maintains a relatively constant duration. On the other hand, a non-rolling ladder has a duration that decreases over time. If you want to obtain the behavior of a non-rolling ladder using bond funds you must decrease the duration of the bond fund over time. You can do this by by mixing two funds so that their weighted average duration is the same as the ladder which you are trying to mimic. In some cases it may not be possible to find a fund with the duration that you want.

== Duration ==

It is useful to focus on the [[Bonds: advanced topics#Duration | duration]] of your bond fund, such as the Vanguard TIPS Fund, which currently has a duration of [https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/mutual-funds/profile/vipsx#portfolio-composition 6.8 years]. [[William Bernstein]] provides an insightful [http://www.efficientfrontier.com/ef/999/duration.htm definition of duration] as the "point of indifference" for the owner of a bond fund in dealing with interest rate changes.

If interest rates rise after purchasing a bond fund, the NAV of the fund falls, which hurts you. However, the dividends that the bond fund throws off can now be reinvested at a higher rate. The duration is the length of time that an investor needs to hold the fund for the increased yields to compensate for the decrease in NAV. In that sense, duration represents the length of time it would take for the total value of the fund, with dividends reinvested, to be worth exactly what it would have been worth had interest rates not risen. So, you should always hold bond funds with a duration equal to or shorter than the expected need for your money (note that holding the duration shorter than your need for the money leaves you exposed to the risk of lower returns if interest rates fall).

Of course, as discussed above, this definition of duration applies equally to bond funds and to an individual portfolio of bonds. The relationship does not exactly hold if the [[Bonds: advanced topics#Yield_Curves | yield curve]] shifts in a non-parallel fashion, but the difference is expected to be small.

Interest rates change continuously, not just at a single point in time. Therefore, as the time when you will need the money approaches, you must reduce your duration accordingly, to protect you against any further increases in prevailing rates. The ways in which this can be done are discussed below.

=== Why thinking of individual bond principal return as "safe" is misleading ===

The common argument for individual bonds over a fund is that at maturity you are guaranteed to get your principal back. While this is true, the principal is only one of the three sources of return for a bond:
# Principal
# Interest (coupon payments)
# Interest-on-interest (reinvested coupon payments)

According to [[wikipedia:Frank J. Fabozzi|Frank J. Fabozzi]] in the ''Handbook of Fixed Income Securities'', 1991, p97:
{{blockquote|In high interest rate environments, the interest-on-interest component for long-term bonds may be as high as 70 percent of the bond's potential total dollar return.}}

Therefore, focusing on the principal as "safe" misses the point, since in many circumstances it is the smallest component of a bond's return. If you are saving for a large goal, you therefore have to invest considerably more into the bond than you want guaranteed to ensure the need is met by the principal. 

To make sure the total value (all three components listed above) winds up being what you expected it to be, you should maintain a portfolio duration equal to your investment horizon and continually reduce the duration as your investment horizon nears (or more realistically, rebalance every 3-12 months, which Michael Granito in ''Bond Portfolio Immunization'' claims did not cause any substantial deviations from target return vs. continuous rebalancing in a variety of simulated market conditions). A zero-coupon bond does this automatically. A coupon-paying bond does not (duration declines very slowly at first and then more rapidly once the bond nears its maturity; this is more pronounced in high-rate environments and less important in low-rate periods), nor does a bond fund (duration is relatively constant). Stated differently, since the duration of a coupon-paying bond is less than its maturity, if you invest such that the bond matures when you need the money, you are by definition not investing such that the duration is equal to your investment horizon, leaving you vulnerable to interest rate declines.

In another text (''Fixed Income Mathematics'', 1993, p175), Frank J. Fabozzi summarizes:
{{blockquote|Therefore, investing in a coupon bond with a yield to maturity equal to the target yield and a maturity equal to the investment horizon does not assure that the target accumulated value will be achieved.}}

=== Zero-coupon example ===

If you have a sudden need to extract the principal from a bond fund (or portfolio of individually-held bonds, for that matter), you can do so as rapidly as possible by selling the fund and buying a [[zero-coupon bond]] with the face value of your principal. Such a bond will always be available, because if the fund's NAV is down, yields will have gone up a commensurate amount. On average (with a typical yield curve), the bond will have a maturity equal to the duration of the TIPS fund. (A regular TIPS bond would also serve the same purpose, but a zero coupon bond makes the calculation simpler, because the duration equals the maturity.)

The strategy of buying a zero-coupon bond works because the duration of a zero equals the maturity, and therefore declines steadily as time passes. No other commonly-available type of bond instrument has this property (although it can be replicated with bond funds or with individual bonds, provided you rebalance regularly). Therefore, if you have a fixed, known obligation at some future point in time, a zero-coupon bond is the obvious choice to satisfy it.

''For example:'' Fred buys a bond fund while Larry buys bond ladder, each with equal duration. Interest rates skyrocket just afterward. At that moment, Fred and Larry have an equal loss. Fred can log into Vanguard and see that his fund balance is, say, 70% of what he invested. Larry can log into Vanguard Brokerage Services and see that the total value of all of the bonds in his ladder are 70% of what he invested. Whether either decides to realize the loss or not, the loss has in fact occurred.

Now, the only difference between Fred and Larry is that Larry has two options for getting his money back and Fred has one. Fred can sell his bond fund and buy a [[Zero-coupon bond|zero coupon bond]] with a maturity value equal to his initial capital investment. Larry can likewise sell his bond ladder and buy a zero coupon bond. Larry's additional option is to hold all of his bonds until maturity. However, this second option is unambiguously worse for Larry. He would need to hold his longest bonds twice as long as the zero coupon bond to get his money back. Due to the [[wikipedia:Opportunity cost|opportunity cost]] of having his money unnecessarily locked up, this means he would actually be losing money versus the zero coupon option. In addition, for taxable accounts, selling their holdings to buy zero coupon bonds would let Larry and Fred take advantage of [[tax loss harvesting]].

Please note that this whole example is artificial, because it is extremely rare for a bond holder to decide that he needs to immediately liquidate all of his principal. Instead, bond holders are generally interested in steady growth over the long term. Some people suffered 15 or 20% losses in their bond holdings (both fund and ladders) in late 2008. Very few sold their holdings to buy zero coupon bonds. Instead, they continued making periodic contributions like they always do, ignoring the balance of the fund. And this was certainly the right choice, as the funds have regained their previous value.

The whole argument for individual bonds being less risky is based on this completely artificial concept that you will one day decide you need all of your money back, and then happily wait 20 years to get it back (all in nominal terms, meaning the money has been eaten away by inflation in the meantime). The point of using zero coupon bonds is that they are an equally arbitrary option. But they show that Fred is never worse off than Larry: a bond fund is no riskier than a bond ladder.

In real life, people should hold bond funds (high grade, short or intermediate term, and a mix of nominal and inflation-adjusted), and just ignore the NAV. All that matters is total return, and if you hold the fund longer than the duration, your total return will be just fine. The zero coupon example is just an academic way of making that point.

These ideas were discussed on these threads:

* {{Forum link| p=576831| title= Bond funds vs. individual bonds}}

== Convexity ==

Positive convexity, a characteristic possessed by bonds without options, is ignored in the above discussion but only strengthens the argument, since positive convexity lengthens duration when rates fall and shortens duration when rates rise. The [[Bonds: advanced topics#Convexity|advanced bonds section]] contains more detail.

== Yield curve changes ==

Changes in the shape of the [[Bonds: advanced topics#Yield_Curves|yield curve]] may make a difference in the above comparison, but the effect is expected to be minor and ambivalent in direction.

However, given the normal (non-inverted) shape of the yield curve, absent any interest rate changes the narrower spread of durations in a long-term or intermediate-term fund will usually prevail over the typical individual's rolling bond ladder of the same duration (where bonds are purchased and held until maturity, then rolled over into new bonds). This strategy is referred to as "riding the yield curve"&lt;ref&gt;{{forum link| t=132601| title=Riding the yield curve, in action| date=February 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, while not without risk does come with an expected return bonus. The risk can be summarized in terms of a lower convexity, which implies that interest rate changes will have a greater impact on a narrow, "bullet" portfolio than on a broader, "barbell" portfolio.

== Major factors ==

=== Diversification ===

Diversification is important for bonds, as it is for all asset classes. The argument against an investor ever owning individual [[Corporate bonds |corporate]] or [[Municipal bonds |municipal bonds]] (even in a ladder) is that the effect of a single default (such as a corporation or city brought down by fraud), even if unlikely, could be devastating to your portfolio. By contrast, bond funds allow extremely broad diversification at a very low cost.

A ladder of individual bonds generally includes between 10 and a couple dozen bonds. That means that each bond represents 2.5% to 10% of a portfolio. By contrast [{{Vf | 0084}} Total Bond] owns [{{Vf | 0084}} 3855 different bonds], and [{{Vf | 0042}} Intermediate Term Tax Exempt] owns [{{Vf | 0042}} 1971]. So, the failure (default) of any one bond has a minuscule effect on the fund.

The only exceptions are Treasury bonds (including [[TIPS]]). Because all Treasury bonds are explicitly backed by the US government, they have the highest possible credit rating. They also all have the same issuer. There is no diversification benefit from owning a Treasury bond fund instead of individual Treasury bonds.

=== Convenience ===

Investors in a bond fund can buy or sell additional shares at any time in any quantity. There is usually no transaction fee for buying or selling additional shares. With individual bonds, purchases on the primary market may only be made on the pre-set issuer schedule (for example, every few months for TIPS). Purchases on the secondary market are generally subject to a commission and you always pay a [[bid/ask spread]], which can be substantial. Also, individual bond purchases are only available in increments of $1,000 (and more often $5,000 or $10,000).

Bond funds offer automatic dividend reinvestment. While you are in your accumulation phase, it is far more convenient to have dividends automatically reinvested. Even after beginning to spend your holdings, it is generally simpler to have bond funds automatically reinvest dividends and then just sell a fixed amount of the fund monthly or quarterly. By contrast, there is no simple way to reinvest small amounts into individual bonds. It is also far more convenient to [[Rebalancing |rebalance]] between a bond fund and other assets in your portfolio.

Taxes are simpler for bond funds. If you invest in a bond fund in a taxable account, you receive tax forms from the bond fund company. If you have a portfolio of individual bonds, you receive tax forms from TreasuryDirect or your brokerage account listing the tax-related items for each bond. it is easier to figure out the tax reporting for one bond fund versus many individual bonds. Also, owners of individual TIPS owe a tax on [[TIPS#Tax considerations | phantom income]] that they do not receive. This is not an issue with TIPS funds.

On the other hand, for investors who are accustomed to managing a portfolio of individual bonds, a rolling bond ladder can be fairly simple to manage and can be simpler to understand conceptually. This is made somewhat more complicated when individual issues are discontinued, leaving a hole in the bond ladder. For instance, there were no 20-year Treasuries issued from 1986-1993. The solution is either to find equivalent combinations of bonds which keep the overall duration the same (in a 6% interest rate environment, to replace the 20-year you could use 36% 10-year and 64% 30-year bonds), or to buy a longer issue from which some time has elapsed on the secondary market (for example, buy a 30-year bond issued 10 years ago) and bear the cost of the poor spread individuals receive when buying bonds in small lots.

=== Costs ===

The costs associated with owning bonds are commissions, [[bid/ask spread]]s, and management fees. Primary purchases of bonds (such as at a TIPS auction) generally do not incur commissions or bid/ask spreads. Purchases and sales on a secondary market can have substantial commissions and bid/ask spreads, particularly on less liquid bonds like [http://moneywatch.bnet.com/investing/blog/irrational-investor/municipal-bonds-and-the-industrys-dirty-little-secret/1621/ municipals] and corporates. Spreads also tend to be wider for the smaller value transactions that individual investors make.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;[[Larry Swedroe]] [http://moneywatch.bnet.com/investing/blog/wise-investing/the-truth-about-municipal-bond-costs/1502/?tag=col1;blog-river comments]{{dead link}} that: "The bid side will widen as the trade size gets smaller (unlike that for stocks)".&lt;/ref&gt; Except for primary purchases of Treasury bonds and TIPS, bond funds pay much lower bid/ask spreads on their bond transactions, giving them a significant cost advantage over regular investors purchasing individual bonds. Even for Treasuries bought at auction, the cost discrepancy is not clear-cut; off-the-run Treasuries generally pay higher yields than new issues of the same effective maturity, mitigating much of the advantage of buying new issues with no spread. Larry Swedroe has pointed out out that the same phenomenon exists in the municipal bond market as well.

There is no management fee for holding a portfolio of individual bonds. However, there is an opportunity cost associated with the time to do so. If you enjoy purchasing TIPS in auction, than this time is really a consumption item rather than an expense. If tracking auction dates and the shape of the yield curve does not seem like fun, than it should be treated as a real cost. For example, holding $100,000 of VAIPX (Vanguard [{{Vf | 5119}} Inflation-Protected Securities Fund Admiral]) costs $110 per year (with an expense ratio of 0.11%). If you value your time at $55 an hour, it is more cost effective to use this fund than hold your own portfolio of bonds if it takes you more than two hours a year to manage your portfolio.

=== Control over maturity and other bond characteristics ===

==== Control over maturity ====

By managing your own portfolio of bonds, you can either pick the average duration you want or "ride" the [[Bonds: advanced topics#Yield Curves | yield curve]] to pick up bonds that are "cheap" compared to the [[Laddering Bonds or CDs | ladder]] overall, and allow your [[Bonds: advanced topics#Duration|duration]] to fluctuate with your purchases. In either case, you are in control. With a bond fund, the duration is designed not to move more than a year or two and is managed by the fund.

However, you need to consider who is in the best position to find bonds that are slightly under-priced, you or a dozen expert bond analysts at a fund company whose only job it is to follow the bond market? 

Also, if you would like a shorter duration than offered by a bond fund, it is easy to shorten it by putting a portion of the money in a [[Money Markets | money market fund]]. For example, the Vanguard municipal bond fund for New York has an average maturity of [{{Vf | 0076}} 11.1 years]. You can approximately halve that by holding half of your money in that fund and half in the [{{Vf | 0163}} New York Tax Exempt Money Market]. Depending on the shape of the yield curve (concave vs. convex), this may cost you return.

==== Control over convexity ====

While it is relatively easy to calculate the [[Bonds: advanced topics#Convexity | convexity]] of a portfolio of individual bonds, most bond funds (including Vanguard&lt;ref&gt;{{forum link| p=655486| title=Convexity information on Vanguard bond funds}}&lt;/ref&gt;) do not make the convexity of their funds available. This opens the door for manager risk (where unscrupulous managers can "juice" their yield by buying bonds with lower convexity, so that investors will never know until it is too late). However, while investors in a portfolio of individual bonds can calculate the convexity, few do, in part because taking advantage of this generally requires purchasing on the secondary market, which is expensive for small portfolios. Therefore the real-world application of this difference may be limited.

==== Control over inflation factor ====

There is an additional factor to consider for [[Treasury_Inflation_Protected_Securities|TIPS]], in that buying individual issues gives you control over the "inflation factor" (also known as the "index ratio"). This allows you to manage deflation risk (generally at some premium which reflects the market's expectation of deflation).

==== Control over tax-efficient characteristics ====

Some managers may choose to purchase AMT bonds to increase yield, which disadvantages investors subject to this tax. This is easily avoided by researching the fund's holdings.

==== Control over call risk ====

Managers may also choose to purchase bonds with higher call risk to boost the fund's yield, which disadvantages investors if the risk shows up at the wrong time or if they are not planning for this risk in their overall portfolio. Careful research into long-term track records and holdings of funds will mitigate this problem.

==== Control over liquidity ====

Bond funds have to meet redemptions at any time. They may handle this in at least two ways: by holding cash reserves or by investing in more liquid bonds (for example, on-the-run Treasuries vs. off-the-run Treasuries). Both approaches earn lower yields on the proportion of the fund held as liquidity reserves.

==== Availability of other fixed income types ====

CDs are not available in a bond fund. Often CDs yield more than the equivalently risk-free Treasury of similar duration.

=== Manager risk and opacity === 

Select bond funds carefully. The experience of Schwab YieldPlus Investor [http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=swypx&amp;d=t (SWYPX)] demonstrates this risk. An UltraShort bond fund that was billed as a safe alternative to money market funds lost over 50% of its NAV. Read the prospectus carefully for indications such as the use of complicated derivatives (options, futures, options on futures, swaps), leverage, short sales, junk bonds, foreign and emerging market bonds, convertible securities, mortgage dollar rolls, and so on. YieldPlus used all of these. While it is possible to use these tools to reduce risk, it is also possible to greatly magnify the risk in exchange for only small gains in yield. The rise of bond index funds holds the possibility of eliminating manager risk entirely, leaving only the much smaller risk of tracking error.

=== Tax-loss harvesting ===

[[Larry Swedroe]] [http://moneywatch.bnet.com/investing/blog/irrational-investor/bonds-or-bond-funds-an-easy-choice/873/?tag=col1;blog-river makes the interesting point]{{dead link}} that holding a portfolio of individual bonds lets you [[Tax_loss_harvesting | tax-loss harvest]] at the single-bond level; with a fund you can only tax-loss harvest when a whole fund incurs a loss. The magnitude of this benefit is unclear and will depend on your tax bracket. Because bid-ask spreads tend to be large on the secondary market (particularly for non-Treasuries), this strategy is not viable for most individual investors. Moreover, because Boglehead strategy is to [[Principles_of_Tax-Efficient_Fund_Placement | place bonds in tax-advantaged spaces whenever possible]], the ability to tax-loss harvest is likely quite limited for most smaller investors (as he himself points out, "For typical smaller investor bond funds are the ONLY way to go."). For larger portfolios involving Treasuries in taxable accounts, Larry Swedroe's insight may tip the balance in favor of holding individual bonds.

== When to hold which ==

As explained earlier, the value of a rolling bond ladder reacts the same to market changes as the NAV of a bond fund if their holdings are the same so daily price fluctuations should not be a consideration. However, there are other factors to consider when choosing between a bond fund and a rolling ladder of individual issues, as detailed below. The principal tradeoff for a long-term investor is the diversification of bond funds and the low trading costs vs. the expense ratio of the fund.

For bond categories with high credit risk such as [[Corporate bonds| corporate bonds]], [[High yield bonds |high yield bonds]], or [[Emerging market bonds |emerging market bonds]], bond funds are the clear choice because the diversification benefit clearly exceeds the expense ratio. For [[Municipal bonds |municipal bonds]] the picture is less clear, as default rates are quite low; nevertheless for small-to-medium-sized portfolios ([http://moneywatch.bnet.com/investing/blog/irrational-investor/bonds-or-bond-funds-an-easy-choice/873/?tag=col1;blog-river Larry Swedroe suggests $500k minimum portfolio size whereas Alan Roth suggests $50m]{{dead link}}) the diversification benefit still argues for a fund, as does the liquidity premium (bid/ask spreads are quite high for municipal bonds).

For [[Treasury bonds |treasury bonds]] (including [[Treasury_Inflation_Protected_Securities | TIPS]]), which are assumed to lack any credit risk, the diversification of a fund adds little benefit over a rolling bond ladder. Therefore the expense ratio is merely a convenience fee (or perhaps a small liquidity premium). For a low-cost Treasury fund, however, that fee may be reasonable and is a matter of personal preference. If the greater liquidity and lower demands on investor time of a fund are not desired, the preferred method of investing in Treasuries is to purchase individual bonds at auction (which is generally free), assuming the spread over equivalent off-the-run issues is not too large. This is particularly true you are considering [[CDs_vs_bonds | CDs as a substitute for Treasuries]], as they often yield more and are unavailable in fund form.

'''Mortgage backed securities''', which include Ginnie Mae Securities (GNMA) and Collateralized Debt Instruments (CDO), are among the most complex fixed income securities. Vanguard provides a basic description of mortgage backed securities in the prospectus to its bond funds:
{{blockquote|
Mortgage-backed securities represent interests in underlying pools of mortgages. Unlike ordinary bonds, which generally pay a fixed rate of interest at regular intervals and then repay principal upon maturity, mortgage-backed securities pass through both interest and principal from underlying mortgages as part of their regular payments. Because the mortgages underlying the securities can be prepaid at any time by homeowners or by corporate borrowers, mortgage-backed securities are subject to [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/prepaymentrisk.asp prepayment risk]. These types of securities are issued by a number of government agencies, including the GNMA, the FHLMC, and the FNMA, [as well as by private issuers].
As a rule, when interest rates rise, bond prices fall. The opposite is also true: Bond prices go up when interest rates fall. Mortgage-backed securities are different. In general, declining interest rates will not lift the prices of mortgage-backed securities—such as GNMAs—as much as the prices of comparable bonds. Why? Because when interest rates fall, the bond market tends to discount the prices of mortgage-backed securities for prepayment risk—the possibility that homeowners will refinance their mortgages at lower rates and cause the bonds to be paid off prior to maturity. In part to compensate for this prepayment possibility, mortgage-backed securities tend to offer higher yields than other bonds of comparable credit quality and maturity.}}

==Risks==
In addition to the [[Bond basics#Risks | normal risks of bonds]], mortgage-backed securities exhibit negative [[Bonds: advanced topics#Convexity|convexity]]. This negative convexity results from [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/contractionrisk.asp contraction risk], when homeowners refinance as interest rates fall, and from [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/extensionrisk.asp extension risk], when homeowners delay pre-payments as interest rates rise.

Determining the exact extent of this negative convexity is impossible, as it depends on how mortgagors behave. In general, this behavior is non-linear: small changes make little difference in homeowner behavior but large changes cause homeowners to overcome inconvenience and refinance in larger numbers. Statistical modeling can approximate the extent of negative convexity, but behavior with large interest rate changes is relatively hard to predict. Bondholders are compensated for this risk by the "option-adjusted spread," which can be interpreted as the market's assessment of the size of prepayment risk. 

== Role in a portfolio ==
While there is some question as to whether the option-adjusted spread has historically been enough to compensate investors for the increased risk of MBSs, the general consensus is that the market prices these securities efficiently. However, in [[Special:BookSources/978-0-312-35363-6|''The Only Guide to a Winning Bond Strategy You'll Ever Need'']], [[Larry Swedroe]] argues that these bonds do not properly diversify the risks of stocks in the portfolio as a whole due to their negative convexity: "In a rising rate environment ... MBS will have increasing correlation with equities, and this is not a good thing."

Other Bogleheads hold large allocations of their portfolio in MBS, either by holding Total Bond Market (since a large portion of that fund is in MBS) or directly through the [[GNMA]] fund. [[John Bogle]] has expressed some skepticism of these bonds, calling them "non-bonds."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://johncbogle.com/wordpress/2007/06/15/john-bogle-responds-to-ask-jack-questions-2/| title=John Bogle responds to “Ask Jack” questions| publisher=The Bogle eBlog| date=June 15, 2007| accessdate=October 3, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Holding MBSs as a part of a diversified bond portfolio is unlikely to lead to ruin, and over time you are likely to be compensated for the increased risk of negative convexity with higher yield. Therefore, it can make sense to invest in MBSs, either directly or through a total bond market fund (which typically are about one-third MBS), provided you understand that you are taking a moderate amount of additional risk. If you do not want the added risk of negative convexity, or you are interested in lowering the correlation between the bond component of your portfolio and the equity component, you would be fine sticking to bonds that lack embedded options.

== Types of mortgage-backed security ==

; Government and quasi-governmental agencies
: [[GNMA]] obligations are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government, just as [[Treasury Bonds | Treasuries]] are. [[Fannie Mae]] and [[Freddie Mac]] are public companies but are assumed to have the backing of the U.S. Government. This was borne out in the 2008 crisis, when the Federal Government did just that. They are therefore considered quasi-governmental agencies.
; Corporate
:Non-government-backed MBSs are a very small part of the market. GNMA, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac hold the bulk of all MBSs.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''', also called '''junk bonds''', are bonds (corporate, municipal, or foreign) with low credit quality. These companies are at much greater risk of default than higher quality credits and, as a result, pay higher coupon interest rates than comparable high quality corporate bonds.

==Definition==

High-yield bonds are generally defined as bonds [[Bond basics#Credit ratings | rated]] below BBB. Historically, most high-yield bonds were originally [[Corporate bonds | investment-grade bonds]] which were downgraded to junk status. The 1980s saw the widespread use of [[Wikipedia: Mezzanine capital|mezzanine financing]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.bondcapital.ca/media/pdf/Bond_Capital_Mezzanine_Finance.pdf| title=Mezzanine Finance| publisher=Bond Capital Messanine Inc.| date=2012| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200612110441/https://www.bondcapital.ca/wp-content/uploads/pdfs/what-is-mezzanine-finance.pdf| archive-date=June 12, 2020}}]&lt;/ref&gt; in leveraged buy-outs and a dramatic expansion of the size of the junk market from $2.6B in 1977 to $227.8B in 1989 (Handbook of Fixed Income Securities, 1991).

==Risks==

High yield bonds exhibit risks applicable to bonds, some of which are pronounced in high yield bonds.

* Credit risk. Because high yield bonds are issued by companies with low credit ratings, there is a much greater risk that the issuers will default.
*Call risk. Issuers typically call their bonds when the interest rate goes down. High yield bonds come with additional call risk. If the issuers' [[Bond basics#Credit ratings | credit ratings]] improve, they can call the existing bonds and borrow money at a lower interest rate. This type of call risk is not applicable to bonds with high ratings. 

==Role in a portfolio==

Investors should almost always purchase high-yield bonds as part of a low cost fund. The high default risk makes diversification essential, and high trading costs make individual bond purchases unwise.

Due to the high risk of this asset class, investors could very easily choose not to include it at all in their portfolios. Certain commentators even argue that the risks are unlikely to be rewarded in the future, and that past success was more due to statutory changes limiting the market for junk bonds or due to different kinds of bonds ("fallen angels") that no longer dominate the market (since the rise of bonds used for mezzanine financing) than due to inherent long-term superiority of the asset class. The same commentators generally argue that risk should be taken in equity rather than in fixed income, since the former offers unlimited potential gains, whereas the latter only offers a limited upside due to the coupon being fixed and call options.

Should investors choose to include junk bonds for their diversification and potential high returns? Rick Ferri's ''[[Special:BookSources/978-0-07-170078-8|All About Asset Allocation]]'' suggests 20% of fixed income or 10% of the overall portfolio for early-accumulators, midlife-accumulators, and pre- and active retirees. John Bogle comments that a modest "seasoning" of higher-yielding bonds may be appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.morningstar.com/cover/videoCenter.aspx?id=599816&amp;SR=EVZ128| title=Bogle: Yield Seekers Shouldn't Go Out on a Limb| publisher=Morningstar| date=June 13, 2013}}{{dead link}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When considering the stock/bond breakdown for rules-of-thumb such as "your age in bonds," caution would recommend considering the high-yield portion as part of the former, risky, category rather than as part of the latter, safe, one.

===Are junk bonds equity or fixed-income?===

While high-yield bonds are a distinct asset class, with their own risk and reward characteristics, they have a higher correlation with equities than do investment-grade bonds. For an investment-grade bond, the growth prospects and future profitability of a company are somewhat irrelevant as long as they are judged to be sufficient to meet future bond obligations. For a high-yield bond (or for a stock), the value of the security is intimately linked to the exact state of future profitability. Therefore, junk bonds are much more sensitive to the particulars of the market's valuation of future financial prospects.

"The high-return characteristics and generally junior position in the capital structure makes this security class much closer to equity than traditional fixed income securities," according to Robert Long in the ''Handbook of Fixed Income Securities'', 1991. He continues, "Financing techniques of recent years have developed a variety of instruments including bonds with equity interests, variable payments depending on operating results or commodity indexes, extendable maturities, resettable coupons, automatic conversion to equity, and other esoteric features that further blur the traditional distinction between bonds and stocks."

At the same time, high yield bonds have as a category had returns which cannot be replicated by simply averaging corporate bonds and equity results, and therefore cannot merely be a hybrid of the two categories. Rick Ferri points out the 1st Quarter 2009 Vanguard Results:
+4.6% = High Yield bonds (VWEHX),
+0.1% = Intermediate-Treasury (VFITX),
-10.7% = US Total Stock Market (VTSMX),
-18.1% = US Small Value (VISVX).

In ''[[Special:BookSources/978-0-07-170078-8|All About Asset Allocation]]'', Ferri states:
{{blockquote|Statistically, only about 25 percent of the default risk in high-yield corporate bonds can be attributed to the same factors affecting equity returns; however the results are not statistically significant. If you allocate 10 percent of your total portfolio to one of the B-BB rated bond funds listed at the end of the chapter, at most perhaps 2 percent of that could be considered equity related. ... That being said, very-low-quality bond funds (those with an average credit quality of CCC or less) do have a higher correlation with equity returns.}}

==Corporate high yield bond indexes== 
Bloomberg provides three U.S. corporate high yield bond indexes. 
*'''Bloomberg U.S. Corporate High-Yield Index''' is the most comprehensive index.
*'''Bloomberg U.S. Corporate High-Yield 2% Issuer Capped Index''' limits the exposure of each issuer to 2% of the total market value and redistributes any excess market value index-wide on a pro-rata basis.
* '''Bloomberg U.S. High-Yield Very Liquid Index (VLI)''', is a more liquid version of the U.S. Corporate High-Yield Index.

The Bloomberg 2% capped and VLI indexes are investable. Other U.S. high yield bond indexes include the CSFB High Yield II Index (CSHY), Citigroup US High-Yield Market Index, the Merrill Lynch High Yield Master II (HOAO), and the iBoxx $ Liquid High Yield Index.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' are bonds that can be converted into common stock at the option of the bondholder. The conversion provision of a convertible bond grants the bondholder the right to convert the bond into a predetermined number of shares of common stock of the issuer. A convertible bond is, therefore, a bond with an embedded call option to buy the common stock of the issuer.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;An exchangeable security grants the bondholder the right to exchange the bond for the common stock of a firm other than the issuer of the bond. (Ref: Finance: Capital Markets, Financial Management, and Investment Management)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frank J. Fabozzi, Pamela Peterson Drake, ''Finance: Capital Markets, Financial Management, and Investment Management'', ISBN 978-0-470-40735-6, [https://techbus.safaribooksonline.com/book/finance/9780470407356 Safari Books Online], accessed September 10, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first convertible bonds were sold by US railroad companies in the mid nineteenth century. The contemporary convertible bond market is global, with securities being issued in the US, Canada, Europe, Asia Pacific ex Japan, and Japan.&lt;ref name ="Credit Suisse"&gt; [https://publications.credit-suisse.com/index.cfm/publikationen-shop/white-papers/convertible-bonds/  Convertible Bonds, Fundamentals Asset Allocation Solvency], Credit Suisse whitepaper, 2014. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Institutional issuers and purchasers of convertible bonds==
Issuers of convertible bonds often do so in order to reduce the interest coupon payable upon the bond issue, or to delay dilution of stock equity holders.&lt;ref&gt;[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wonders-convertible-bonds-160000020.html The Wonders Of Convertible Bonds] &lt;/ref&gt; The option of stock conversion is a value that investors pay a premium for, so the bond issuer can demand a higher price for the bond, which results in a lower interest coupon on the bond.

Historically, major large financial institutions such as insurance companies, banks, and hedge funds have been major participants in the convertible bond market. Insurance companies have purchased convertibles to gain stock market exposure from bond portfolios; banks have issued convertible bonds to meet regulatory capital requirements, and hedge funds have specialized in convertible bond arbitrage strategies. However, many arbitrage hedge funds closed due to heavy losses in 2007 and 2008,&lt;ref&gt; [https://online.wsj.com/article/SB122688700899932417.html Convertible-Bond Arbitrage Loses Its Shirt], WSJ, November 17, 2008 &lt;/ref&gt; and in June 2011 bank regulators  placed restrictions on the use of some types of convertible bonds used to meet capital requirements by very large, systemically important banks.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-07-19/basel-regulators-force-banks-to-cut-contingent-convertible-plans.html Basel Regulators Force Banks to Cut Plans for Contingent Convertible Bonds], Bloomberg, July 19, 2011 &lt;/ref&gt;

==Convertible bond fundamentals==

Convertible bonds possess a number of complex features. The specific terms of a bond's maturity, coupon, and conversion options can be different for each bond and are detailed in the bond indenture,&lt;ref group="note"&gt; An indenture is "a contract between an issuer of bonds and the bondholder stating the time period before repayment, amount of interest paid, if the bond is convertible (and if so, at what price or what ratio), if the bond is callable and the amount of money that is to be repaid." [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/indenture.asp Indenture], investopedia definition. &lt;/ref&gt; that entitles the investor to convert the bonds into a predetermined number of stock shares.&lt;ref name ="Credit Suisse" /&gt; 

Valuing a convertible bond can be complex due to the hybrid nature of the instrument, as it contains both fixed income and stock market factors. Professional institutional investors tend to use the mathematics of options (colloquially known as "the Greeks")&lt;ref group="note"&gt; See [[Wikipedia:Greeks (finance)|Greeks (finance)]] for a listing of the mathematical functions used in valuing options.&lt;/ref&gt; to model the non-linear interplay of these factors. 

The basic elements in valuing a convertible bond are graphically illustrated in Figure 1. The graph models bond valuation (the base price); the stock conversion value (conversion price x number of shares), and the premium for the conversion option. 

===Base price===
[[File:Convertiblebondconversion.gif|thumb|right| 390px| Figure 1: Convertible Bonds&lt;ref group="note"&gt; The graph is based on the following inputs. &lt;br&gt; ''Assume that a new issue convertible has come to market. It has a 5 percent coupon and 10 years to maturity. The issuing company has other 10 year debt that carries an 8 percent yield, and the company's stock is currently trading at $42.'' &lt;br&gt; ''The bond indenture specifies a conversion price of $50. Since we know that the conversion price is the effective price for conversion into stock with the bond at par, we divide the par value of the bond ($1,000) by $50, resulting in a conversion ratio of 20 shares. To calculate the current conversion value, we know that the stock price is currently $42. Multiplying $42 by 20 shares, we get a current conversion value of $840. If the issue is sold at par, then the conversion premium would be 19 percent ([$1,000 - 840]/840). The investment value of the convertible at issuance would be the security with the 5 percent coupon discounted at a yield to maturity of 8 percent. The result, according to standard bond calculations, is 79.87, or a dollar value of $798.70. The investment premium would be 25.20 percent ([$1,000 - 798]/798).''&lt;br&gt;-- from [https://www.calamos.com/en/FundInvestor/EducationPlanning/PublishedBookExcerpts/CvtSec-Example.aspx Calamos Investments - Convertible Bond Example]

A convertible bond's maturity and fixed interest rate (along with other bond qualifications) are laid out in the bond's indenture.  Assuming the underlying stock price of a convertible bond fails to reach the conversion price, and the bond does not default, an investor will receive, at maturity, the defined bond interest and principal repayment. In the graph, the base price is represented by the horizontal yield to maturity investment value line.

===Conversion price===
The conversion price is established by the bond's indenture. The issuer will declare the number of stock shares (known as the conversion ratio) to be received upon conversion. For example, if the bond is issued at a $1,000 price and is convertible into 20 shares of common stock, the conversion price for the shares will be $50 per share (price divided by convertible shares).

===Conversion premium===
The conversion premium is calculated as follows:

:Conversion Premium = Bond Price - (Stock Price x Conversion Ratio)

Thus, if a bond, with a conversion ratio of 20, was issued at a $1,000 price and the common stock is selling for $42, the conversion  premium would be determined as:

:$160 = $1,000 - $840 = $1,000 - ($42 x 20)

If the issue is sold at par, then the conversion premium would be 19 percent ([$1,000 - 840]/840).

When the value of a convertible bond's underlying stock is far below the price of the bond, the convertible bond will usually behave more like a conventional bond. [[Bonds: advanced topics#Yield to maturity| Yield to maturity]] and conversion premiums will generally be high.  As the value of the underlying stock moves toward parity with the bond price, the convertible bond will become more sensitive to movements in the stock price, and generally provide lower yields to maturity and lower conversion premiums.&lt;ref name="Invesco"&gt; [https://invescopowershares.com/pdf/P-CVRT-WP-1-E.pdf P-CVRT-WP-1-E. Convertible Bond Primer], Invesco Powershares &lt;/ref&gt; Over longer holding periods, convertible bonds have typically realized higher correlations with stock market returns than with bond market returns.

==Risks==

Convertible bonds are subject to the following risks.

* '''Credit risk''': Convertible bonds, like all corporate bonds, are subject to credit risk, the risk that an issuer may default on the debt,&lt;ref group="note"&gt; A Moody's Research report, ''[https://www.moodys.com/sites/products/DefaultResearch/2001200000349053.pdf Default and Recovery Rates of Convertible Bond Issuers: 1970-2000]'', July 2001, provides the following default statistics for US convertible bonds over the 1970 - 2000 period:
* '''Historical loss rates''': The one-year average loss rate for convertible bonds is 1.05%, compared with 0.63% for all non-convertible bonds. "The fact that most convertible bonds are contractually or effectively subordinated seems to underlie this result."
*  '''Recovery rates''': recovering on average $29 per $100 par for defaulted convertible bonds compared with $43 per $100 par for straight bonds. &lt;/ref&gt; or that the bond will be subject to downgraded status due to deteriorating corporate finances and/or deteriorating economic conditions. Many convertible bonds are not investment grade bonds. On a fundamental level, convertible bonds are subordinated debt, meaning that, in default an issuer's conventional bonds must be paid before convertible bonds can be redeemed.
*'''Interest rate risk''': When the value of a convertible bond's underlying stock is far below the price of the bond, the bond will be more subject to price fluctuation caused by changing market interest rates. These changes will be tied to the bond's [[Bonds: advanced topics#Duration |duration]]. Movements in the  bond's value towards the price of conversion is marked by an increasing positive [[Bonds: advanced topics#Convexity |convexity]] in the duration.&lt;ref name="Credit Suisse" /&gt; 
*'''Equity risk''': As the convertible bond moves towards or surpasses conversion parity, the bond becomes more influenced by the movement of the underlying stock price, usually with an increase in volatility. While the interest earned by convertible bonds helps cushion downside risk, convertible bonds can experience considerable declines in market value, as shown in the market performance of US convertible bonds during bear markets in stocks:&lt;ref name="Invesco"/&gt;
::{| class="wikitable" style="width:600px"

|-align="center"
| October 9, 2007&lt;br&gt;to March 9, 2009|| -42.9% || -55.3%
|}
*'''Call risk''': Convertible bonds are frequently issued with call provisions which give the issuing company the right to redeem the bonds prior to the scheduled maturity date. Called bonds can experience shifting duration, convexity, and yield to maturity depending on interest rate movements. In addition to call provisions, some convertible bonds stipulate a mandatory conversion.&lt;ref&gt; [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mandatoryconvertible.asp Mandatory Convertible], definition, investopedia &lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Sector concentration risk''': Convertible bonds tend to be retired at higher rates than conventional bonds of the same maturity due to maturation, being called, or being converted to stock. The resulting higher turnover can result in rapid changes in the convertible bond market. If newly issued convertibles are offered in just a few economic sectors, the concentration can result in increased volatility.&lt;ref&gt; [https://www.vanguard.com/pub/Pdf/sai1690.pdf Vanguard prospectus], Statement of Additional Information, p. B-6.  &lt;/ref&gt;

==Convertible bond indexes==
Suites of convertible bond [[Indexing|indexes]] are available from the following index providers: 

* '''Bloomberg Convertibles''': Bloomberg's aggregate index for convertible securities is the Bloomberg US Convertible Liquid Bond Index, which includes all four major classes of USD equity-linked securities including: convertible cash coupon bonds, zero-coupon bonds, preferred convertibles with fixed par amounts and mandatory equity-linked securities.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/BCS5TRUU:IND Bloomberg U.S. Convertibles Liquid Bond Index]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''EXANE Convertible Securities''': ECI refers to a range of European Convertible Indexes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rimes.com/exane-convertibles EXANE Convertibles |RIMES]{{broken link}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Jefferies Active Convertible Index''' : The core JACI indexes are a normalized price-weighted composition and the flagship index is the JACI Global - a blend of four major regions in pre-specified blending ratios.&lt;ref&gt; [https://www.rimes.com/jefferies-active-convertible-index Jefferies Active Convertible Index | RIMES]{{broken link}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Merrill Lynch Convertible Bond Indexes''': There are three groups of indexes; the first two, the G300 Global Convertible Master Index and the Global Investment Grade Convertible Master Index, concentrate the larger more liquid issues, and tend to be the most appropriate for benchmarking.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rimes.com/merrill-lynch-convertibles Merrill Lynch Convertibles | RIMES]{{broken link}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''UBS Convertible Indexes''': UBS Convertible Indexes measure the size and performance of the convertibles asset class, and are the most widely used convertible bond benchmark internationally.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rimes.com/ubs-convertibles UBS Convertibles | RIMES]{{broken link}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role in a portfolio==
For individual investors, the credit risk and complex features of convertible bonds suggest that professionally managed [[Mutual fund|mutual funds]] are the best vehicles for investing in this asset class.

Advocates for including convertible bonds in the [[Asset allocation|asset allocation]] of a [[Lazy Portfolios|portfolio]] cite these reasons:

* Convertible bonds have low correlation with high grade bonds and cash, and imperfect correlation with equities, which adds to the diversification of a portfolio.
* Convertible bonds often outperform conventional bonds during periods of rising interest rates.
* Convertible bonds at times provide returns that exceed direct stock market returns, with lower volatility than stock market volatility.&lt;ref&gt; See the mutual fund company Invesco's rationale for including convertibles in a portfolio [https://www.invesco.com/pdf/CLCSEC-BRO-1.pdf Convertible Bond Investing]{{broken link}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Larry Swedroe]] and Jared Kizer argue against including convertible bonds in portfolios in  ''The Only Guide to Alternative Investments You'll Ever Need: The Good, the Flawed, the Bad, and the Ugly''. Among the reasons cited&lt;ref&gt; [[Larry Swedroe | Larry E. Swedroe]], Jared Kizer (2008), ''The Only Guide to Alternative Investments You'll Ever Need: The Good, the Flawed, the Bad, and the Ugly'', Chapter 13, ISBN 978-1576603109 &lt;/ref&gt;:

*  A convertible bond's performance shifts from being bond-like to being stock-like. This results in a shifting asset allocation which makes it impossible to accurately determine a fixed stock/bond asset allocation.
* The hybrid bond/stock character of convertible bonds presents an [[Principles of Tax-Efficient Fund Placement|asset location]] dilemma, since equity investments are often best held in taxable accounts, while higher yielding income investments are best held in [[Employer Retirement Plans Overview|tax preferred accounts]].
* If the convertible bond is callable, it is usually called at a time more advantageous to the issuer than to the investor. 

==Exchange traded funds==
State Street offers the SPDR® Barclays Convertible Securities [[ETF]] (CWB), tracking the, Barclays U.S. Convertible Bond &gt; $500MM Index. The fund has an [[Expense ratio|expense ratio]] of 0.40%.&lt;ref&gt; [https://www.spdrs.com/product/fund.seam?ticker=CWB SPDR® Barclays Convertible Securities ETF (CWB)] &lt;/ref&gt;

iShares offers the iShares Convertible Bond [[ETF]] (ICVT) tracking the same index. The fund has an [[Expense ratio|expense ratio]] of 0.20%.&lt;ref&gt; [https://www.ishares.com/us/products/272819/ishares-convertible-bond-etf iShares Convertible Bond ETF (ICVT))] &lt;/ref&gt;

==Mutual funds==
The mutual fund universe contains a large number of convertible bond funds, most of which are [[Mutual Funds and Fees#Sales fees|broker-distributed load funds]]. Morningstar tracks performance of these funds, categorizing them as "convertibles".&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.morningstar.com/fund-category-returns/convertibles/$FOCA$CV.aspx Convertibles],{{broken link}} from Morningstar.&lt;/ref&gt; The average expense ratio for convertible bond funds, as reported by Morningstar, is 1.13% per annum.

Convertible bond funds are also available as [[:Closed End Funds | closed-end funds]]. These funds are traded on stock exchanges, often trade at discount or premium to [[Net asset value|net asset value]], often employ [[Leverage|leverage]], and often use managed distribution policies. Most have higher than average expense ratios.

Active funds add to the risks inherent in investing in bond funds by introducing '''manager risk'''; the chance that poor security selection or focus on securities in a particular sector or category will cause the fund to underperform relevant benchmarks or other funds with a similar investment objective.

In addition, active convertible bond funds usually contain additional securities other than convertible bonds such as convertible preferred stock. They may also hold  a shifting mix of US and international convertible securities.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' are bonds issued by states and local governments. There are several types:

*'''General Obligation Bonds''' are municipal bonds secured by the taxing and borrowing power of the municipality issuing it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.investorwords.com/2165/General_Obligation_Bond.html General Obligation Bond definition at ''Investor Words'']&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Revenue Bonds''' are municipal bonds supported by the revenue from a specific project, such as a toll bridge, highway, or local stadium.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/revenuebond.asp Revenue Bond definition at ''Investopedia'']&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Assessment Bonds''' are special types of municipal bonds used to fund a development project. Interest owed to lenders is paid by taxes levied on the community benefiting from the particular bond-funded project.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/specialassessmentbond.asp Assessment Bond definition at ''Investopedia'']&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Build America Bonds''' are municipal bonds issued under a program started in 2008.  Through the BAB program, the Federal government directly subsidizes taxable municipal bonds instead of subsidizing municipal bonds via a tax break for their purchasers.  This opens the market up to a wider range of participants, including tax-exempt institutions and individuals with sufficient tax-exempt space.

==Taxation==
===Interest===
Interest from municipal bonds is generally exempt from federal income tax and the issuing state's income tax.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;States with no income tax do not impose taxes on municipal bonds.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are a few exceptions. 

* Interest from some municipal bonds is subject to [http://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc556.html Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT)] although whether you actually have to pay AMT depends on your individual circumstances.  Such bonds are commonly referred to as AMT bonds.
* Some states charge income tax on interest from their own municipal bonds.

* '''Puerto Rico, Guam, and US Virgin Islands:''' No state can tax bond interest issued by US territories.&lt;ref name="muni"&gt;[http://www.municipalbonds.com/education/read/113/tax-exemption-from-state-income-taxes Tax-Exemption from State Income Taxes], from [http://www.municipalbonds.com/about/ MunicipalBonds.com]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''New York City:''' Bonds issued in NY may be triple tax-exempt from city, state, and federal income taxes.&lt;ref name="muni" /&gt;
* '''Utah:''' Utah reciprocates taxation. Utah does not tax its own bonds, but also does not tax bonds issued in states that do not tax Utah bonds.&lt;ref name="muni" /&gt;
* '''Washington D.C.:''' Does not tax in-state or out-of-state municipal bonds.&lt;ref name="muni" /&gt;

===Capital gains/losses===

Capital gains and losses are subject to taxation.  One notable point is the treatment of capital losses for a holding period of less than six months.  For an [[ETF]] holding bonds (but not for a traditional mutual fund if the fund accrues dividends daily and pays them at least monthly, as most bond funds do), if you received exempt-interest dividends, at least part of your loss is disallowed. You can deduct only the amount of loss that is more than the exempt-interest dividends. Report the loss as a short-term capital loss. See [http://www.irs.gov/publications/p550/ch04.html#en_US_2024_publink100010561 Publication 550 (2024), Investment Income and Expenses] and [http://www.fairmark.com/mutual/stcl.htm Short-Term Capital Losses] for more details.

{{Notice|''Example''&lt;br&gt; Assume that an investor purchases $10,000 of a tax-exempt bond ETF. Five months after purchase, the net asset value of the fund has dropped and the investor has a $200 short-term loss. Over this five month period, the investor has received $125 dollars of tax-exempt income. The investor must increase the sales price ($9,800) by the the dividends received. The adjusted basis of $9,925 results in a deductible $75 short term loss.}}

===Social Security===
Municipal bond interest is included in modified adjusted gross income to determine how much of a taxpayer's Social Security is taxed. See: [https://www.irs.gov/publications/p915 Publication 915, Social Security and Equivalent Railroad Retirement Benefits]

==Risks==

===Call risk===
Many bonds are issued with provisions which allow the issuer to repay the bond before the bond reaches maturity. This is termed "calling" the bond. Since issuers call bonds when interest rates fall and the the cost of financing the debt is cheaper in the new lower rate environment, a called bond is disadvantageous to the investor, who now must reinvest the returned capital at lower interest rates. An additional risk with a bond with a call feature is the tendency of the bond to have shifting durations as the likelihood of a call rises and falls with the fluctuation of market interest rates. The bond will sometimes be priced to the call date (when interest rates are falling); at other times to the maturity date (when interest rates are rising).&lt;ref&gt;This tendency is known as negative convexity. See [[Bonds: advanced topics#Convexity|Bonds:advanced topics]]&lt;/ref&gt; Bonds with a call feature usually pay a higher interest rate than non-callable bonds as partial compensation for the increased risk.

===Credit risk===

Credit risk is generally much less than that for corporate bonds.  Nonetheless, it exists.(Refer to [http://www.moodys.com/cust/content/content.ashx?source=StaticContent/Free+pages/Credit+Policy+Research/documents/current/2001700000407258.pdf Moody’s US Municipal Bond Rating Scale] for data on defaults). While only 5 corporations have a AAA credit rating, 16 states are rated AAA.  Furthermore over 90% of municipal bonds are rated A or better by Fitch, while the average corporate bond is rated in the B range&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.learnbonds.com/municipal-bond-defaults/ Municipal Bond Defaults: Don’t Believe the Hype], LearnBonds&lt;/ref&gt;.  The default rates reflect those higher ratings.  According to a report by Moody’s&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moodys.com/researchdocumentcontentpage.aspx?docid=PBC_140114 Moody's], registration required.&lt;/ref&gt; which covers the default rates of municipal bonds from 1970 to 2011, the average default rate of rated municipal bonds was .13% during that time.  That compares to an average default rate of 11.17% for rated corporate bonds over that same time period.  

Some municipal bonds are insured by private insurance companies. ([http://www.afgi.org/who-fact.htm AFGI - The Basics]}

Some investors seek to  mitigate the credit risk by diversifying their municipal bonds beyond the state of residence.  The caveat is that they may have to pay state income tax on the interest from out-of-state municipal bonds.

===Liquidity risk===

Municipal bonds are generally illiquid,&lt;ref&gt;A security that cannot easily be sold or exchanged for cash without a substantial loss in value. [http://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/illiquid.asp illiquid], from Investopedia&lt;/ref&gt; especially at the retail level.  To mitigate the risk, you may consider holding them to maturity or holding them through a low-cost mutual fund, which can trade on the wholesale market.

==Meredith Whitney==

In 2010 analyst Meredith Whitney was interviewed on 60 Minutes and predicted that there would be 50 to 100 sizable defaults&lt;ref&gt;http://youtu.be/hI-rIGyLri4{{Dead link}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Whitney came to fame by being one of the first analysts to predict the banking crisis in 2008, so many investors took that statement to heart.  According to a Vanguard article on the topic&lt;ref&gt;https://personal.vanguard.com/us/insights/article/muni-non-crisis-112012{{Dead link}}&lt;/ref&gt;, from November of 2010 to November of 2011 investors withdrew $35 Billion from municipal bond funds.  Unfortunately for those investors her prediction did not come true this time and the municipal bond market rallied over 12% during that time.

==Role in a portfolio==

* If you have filled up your tax-advantaged accounts with tax-inefficient assets (taxable bonds, [[Real estate investment trust | REITs]], [[Commodities | commodities]], etc), and you still need bonds to meet your desired stock/bond asset allocation, you might consider placing municipal bonds (or a mutual fund thereof) in your taxable account.
* If you are in high tax brackets, and you are saving for short-term cash needs (such as car, home down payment, etc), then you might consider short-term municipal bonds or tax-exempt money market funds.  (Note that [https://personal.vanguard.com/ Vanguard]'s tax-exempt money market funds contain AMT bonds.  [https://www.fidelity.com/homeframe_cp.shtml Fidelity] offers some AMT-free tax-exempt money market funds as well as those with AMT bonds in them.)

==Taxable equivalent yield==

[[Taxable equivalent yield]] of a municipal bond is one that a taxable bond would have to pay to deliver the same amount of income as the municipal bond.  The taxable equivalent yield depends on the investor's tax brackets.  The following calculators allow you to calculate the taxable equivalent yield.

*[http://files.thefinancebuff.com/calculators/Bond-Funds-Yield-Calculator.html Boglehead tfb's Bond Fund Yield Calculator]
*[http://screen.morningstar.com/BondCalc/BondCalculator_TaxEquivalent.html Bond Calculator] (login required)

It's important to calculate the taxable equivalent yield before purchasing municipal bonds because taxable bonds with comparable credit ratings may have greater yields.

      <text bytes="18279" sha1="httwr7no224sfzmzkd6e443v0ci3pvh" xml:space="preserve">Emerging market debt has a long history in the international debt markets, going back to the early nineteenth century. Beginning in 1993, contemporary U.S investors have had access to the '''emerging market bond''' sector through the medium of mutual funds. Historically, most emerging market debt was in the form of external sovereign debt, denominated in an external currency (dollar, pound, euro). Today a majority (3/4) of emerging market debt is issued in local currency.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.investinginbondseurope.org/Pages/BondMarketsAndPrices.aspx?folder_id=510 Bond Markets Defined], investinginbondseurope. 
&lt;/ref&gt; Thus investors have access to funds holding bonds in U.S dollars; funds holding bonds in local currencies; and funds that hold both. Emerging market bond mutual funds are actively managed. Recently the ETF marketplace has offered investors indexed portfolios of emerging market bonds.
[[File:Emerging market debt.jpg|right|border|500px|]]

==Returns and risks==

Prior to the Mexican default in the early 1980's, most sovereign emerging market debt was a product of bank financing. The establishment of so-called "Brady bonds"&lt;ref&gt;Named after the [http://www.emta.org/template.aspx?id=35 Brady Plan], the principles of which were first articulated by U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady in March 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; during the ensuing Mexican debt restructuring transferred emerging market debt to the public bond markets. The data history of emerging market bond investment is therefore brief. Available data begins in 1991 with the creation of the JP Morgan EMBI index,&lt;ref&gt; Refer to [http://lexicon.ft.com/Term?term=EMBI FT Lexicon] for a succinct description of JP Morgan emerging market bond indexes. &lt;/ref&gt; an index of U.S. dollar emerging market bonds. 

As Erb, Harvey, and Visconti&lt;ref&gt; Erb, Claude B.,[[:Campbell R. Harvey | Harvey, Campbell R.]], and Viscanta, Tadas E., [http://faculty.fuqua.duke.edu/~charvey/Research/Working_Papers/W48_Understanding_emerging_market.pdf Understanding Emerging Market Bonds], Oct. 21, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; noted in 1997, emerging market bond returns from 1991-1997 outperformed the performance of the S&amp;P 500 index. They also noted that this short initial return sequence showed high volatility and negative skewness, suggesting that downside risk was high, although not realized in the short term returns data. This insight was proved correct, as the "Asian Contagion" financial crisis in 1998 produced negative returns in 1998. Returns from 2000-2010 have been somewhat less volatile, but the asset class has retained its quality of negative skewness. Erb, Harvey, and Visconti state:
{{blockquote|One difficulty with measuring skewness is that it likely changes through time. Therefore looking at past data may give no indication of future expected skewness. This is the so called “peso problem” in economic theory. Looking at past currency movements, you may see little variation in rates during a managed float regime. However, there is a probability of a devaluation that you cannot detect from looking at past data. This is just the definition of negative skewness.}}

Emerging market bonds are subject to three major risks:
*'''Interest rate risk'''. Most emerging market bond portfolios hold intermediate to long term bonds. Thus the portfolios have high durations and high interest rate risk: bond principal will fluctuate with changes in interest rates.
*'''Currency risk'''. The marketplace is now dominated by local currency bond issues. These bonds bear currency risk, the risk that changes in exchange rates can result in gains or losses.
*'''Sovereign risk'''. The risk that a country will default on its external non-local currency debt. Closely associated with this risk is inflation risk affecting local currency bonds, where a bond's principal value can effectively be destroyed by high inflation.

===Yields===
[[File:Emerging market bond yields.jpg|right|300px]]
In accordance with the high historical risks associated with emerging market bonds, investors have historically demanded high yields as compensation for bearing risk. Yields, of course, fluctuate with economic fundamentals, as well as with investor sentiment. Emerging market bond interest rates are often measured against risk free debt instruments, resulting in what is known as a "yield spread". The adjacent figure shows yield spreads for the period 1993-2010 between the US dollar denominated JP Morgan EMBI Index and comparable US treasury bonds. The figure also traces the level of credit quality within the EMBI index.

===Correlation===
The Vanguard Institutional white paper, ''Global fixed income: Considerations for U.S. investors'', provides correlation data between emerging market bonds and major asset classes for the period between 2002-2010. Over this period, dollar based emerging market debt had higher correlations (between 0.55 and 0.65) with US stocks, developed market stocks, and emerging market stocks, as well as with US bonds; and lower correlations (between 0.30 and 0.45) with hedged and unhedged international bonds. Local currency bonds had lower correlations (0.30) with US stocks, developed market stocks, and emerging market stocks; and higher correlations (between 0.45 and 0.60) with US bonds, hedged international bonds, and unhedged international bonds.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Joseph H. Ph.D., Patterson, Andrew J.; Philips, Christopher B. CFA, and Thomas, Charles J., [https://institutional.vanguard.com/iam/pdf/ICRIFI.pdf Global fixed income: Considerations for U.S. investors], Vanguard Research and Commentary, January 2011, p.11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Erb, Harvey and Visconti note that emerging market bond correlations with other asset classes are subject to shifts, depending on the state of the economy and markets. Thus during the 1998 "Asian Contagion" currency crisis, emerging market bonds were highly correlated with US stocks, emerging market stocks, and high yield bonds, all of which fell in price, and were negatively correlated with US treasuries, which rose in price.&lt;ref&gt;Erb, Claude B.,[[:Campbell R. Harvey | Harvey, Campbell R.]], and Viscanta, Tadas E., [http://faculty.fuqua.duke.edu/~charvey/Research/Working_Papers/W48_Understanding_emerging_market.pdf Understanding Emerging Market Bonds], Oct. 21, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Default risk===
Bond defaults and restructurings have a long history. Prior to the nineteenth century, defaults were common among European nation states. With national independence movements beginning in the early nineteenth century and continuing to this day, bond defaults and restructurings became prevalent among these new "emerging markets."

Defaults and restructurings tend to occur in clusters. Historical clusters include:&lt;ref&gt;[http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/chapters/0262195534chapm1.pdf Sovereign Defaults and Debt Restructurings:Historical Overview], Chapter 1, p 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Arguments for holding emerging market bond funds==
In the Vanguard Institutional white paper, ''Global fixed income: Considerations for U.S. investors'', conditional recommendation for the emerging market bond asset class is enlisted in two main instances:
#'''Investors seeking total market international bond exposure'''. The Bloomberg Aggregate Global Bond Indexes do not include emerging market bonds.
#'''Potential for added diversification'''. The return properties of emerging market bonds: higher expected returns, higher volatility, and expected low correlations to other asset classes, may appeal to certain investors who wish to include it as a portion of a broadly diversified international bond investment. 

==Arguments against holding emerging market bond funds==
[[:Larry Swedroe]] et al., in their book, ''The Only Guide You'll Ever Need for the Right Financial Plan: Managing Your Wealth, Risk, and Investments''&lt;ref&gt;[[Special:BookSources/1576603660|The Only Guide You'll Ever Need for the Right Financial Plan: Managing Your Wealth, Risk, and Investments]]&lt;/ref&gt; argue against including emerging market bonds in investment portfolios. The authors cite the higher default risk and extreme volatility associated with emerging market bonds as negative features of this asset. They make the following clarifying arguments about the negative features:

*They are illiquid.&lt;ref&gt;A security that cannot easily be sold or exchanged for cash without a substantial loss in value. [http://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/illiquid.asp illiquid], from Investopedia&lt;/ref&gt;
*There is the potential for large losses. They exhibit negative [[:skewness]] and high [[:Excess kurtosis|kurtosis]].
*While having low correlation to other asset classes, the correlation of risk to equities tends to turn high at the wrong time: when equities are in distress and investors look to their bond portfolios to provide stability.
*Returns are earned in a tax inefficient manner.
*Implementation costs are high. Mutual funds are needed and they are expensive.&lt;ref&gt;[[Special:BookSources/1576603660|The Only Guide You'll Ever Need for the Right Financial Plan: Managing Your Wealth, Risk, and Investments]], pp.52-53.&lt;/ref&gt;

The authors advise seeking emerging market exposure by investing in emerging market stocks; and state that emerging market bonds should be considered an allocation to the equity asset class (i.e. drawn from the portfolio allocation to equities, and not the portfolio allocation to bonds).&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=1175372#1175372 Is Larry Swedroe saying NOT to own Emerging Markets?] for a discussion regarding ownership of EM stocks.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second edition of ''All About Asset Allocation'' (2010), [[Rick Ferri]] does not include emerging market bonds in his fixed income allocations, citing the high costs (0.50% to over 1.00%) incurred in implementing emerging market bond portfolios.&lt;ref&gt; [[Rick Ferri]], ''[[All About Asset Allocation]]'' (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

In a Bogleheads forum post, Rick Ferri states that having an allocation to international bonds ''might'' provide a diversification benefit, but it may not be worth the extra cost and complexity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Forum post|p=3892907|title=Re: I’m still not a fan of international bond funds|author=Rick Ferri|date=April 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He recommends the following fixed income allocation:

==Index funds and ETFs==
As of 2013, the only indexed mutual fund portfolio of emerging market bonds available to U.S. investors is the Vanguard Emerging Markets Government Bond Index Fund tracking the Bloomberg USD Emerging Markets Government RIC Capped Index. All other available options are ETF portfolios. Five broad market ETFs, all introduced within the past four years, are included in the table below. Three ETF portfolios, the iShares JPMorgan USD Emerging Markets Bond Fund; the PowerShares Emerging Markets Sovereign Debt Portfolio ETF, and the Vanguard Emerging Markets Government Bond ETF invest in U.S dollar denominated securities. The ishares and Powershare funds hold less than 100 bonds; the Vanguard ETF is expected to hold over 500 bonds. Two of the ETFs listed below, Market Vectors Emerging Markets Local Currency Bond ETF and the SPDR Bloomberg Emerging Markets Local Bond ETF, invest in local currency bonds. These two ETFs hold between 100-500 bonds. All five ETFs invest in a wide number of emerging market countries, which is prudent, given the long history of sovereign default risk among emerging market countries. To further diversify against default risk, make sure that portfolios are not concentrated among a small selection of countries.

The ETFs have lower expense ratios than emerging market bond mutual funds or closed end funds, although ETF transaction costs (commissions, spreads, discount/premium) can significantly add to investment costs.

==Active funds and closed end funds==
There are a large assortment of actively managed emerging market bond funds.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://news.morningstar.com/fund-category-returns/emerging-markets-bond/$FOCA$EB.aspx Morningstar] for active emerging market bond funds.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these funds are load funds. No-load funds are available at lower costs with the lowest cost funds registering expense ratios running between 0.88% and 0.99% per annum.

Emerging market bond funds are also available as [[:Closed End Funds | closed-end funds]]. These funds are traded on stock exchanges, often trade at discount or premium to net asset value, often employ leverage, and often use managed distribution policies. Most have higher than average expense ratios.

Active funds add to the risks inherent in emerging market bonds by introducing '''manager risk''', the chance that poor security selection or focus on securities in a particular sector or category will cause the fund to underperform relevant benchmarks or other funds with a similar investment objective.

'''Corporate bonds''' are bonds issued by corporations of sufficient credit quality to be considered investment-grade (i.e. excludes [[High yield bonds | High Yield/"Junk" bonds]]).

==Risks==

===Interest rate risk===
The most common model for thinking about corporate bonds is that they pay a premium on top of the risk-free rate (represented by ultra-short-term default-risk-free assets like Treasury Bills) for assuming other risks.  One of those risks is shared with Treasuries of similar duration: [[Bond basics#Interest rate risk | interest rate risk]].

===Credit risk===
Although legally bondholders must be paid before stockholders, there is nevertheless the risk that a company could default on its loans, triggering bankruptcy proceedings.  This risk varies with the [[Bond basics#Credit risk | credit rating of the bond]].

===Call risk===
Many corporate bonds include [[Bond basics#Call risk | call options]] which allow the issuer to buy back the bond at face value under certain conditions.  This is most likely to occur if market rates fall or if the issuer's credit rating improves substantially, limiting the extent to which the investor can profit from these otherwise favorable occurrences. This [[Bonds: advanced topics#Convexity | negative convexity]] is generally far smaller than the negative convexity experienced by [[Mortgage-backed security | mortgage-backed bonds]].

==Corporate bond types==

Corporate bonds are often broadly classified into 5 groups:&lt;ref&gt;Thau, Annette (2012). The Bond Book. The McGraw Hill Companies. pp. 173.&lt;/ref&gt;

# ''Utilities:'' Bonds issued by companies which provide a public utility such as power or water.
# ''Transportation:'' Bonds issued by companies such as railroads and airlines.  
# ''Industrials:'' This is the group where companies which do not fit cleanly into the other 5 groups are categorized and is therefore the largest and most diverse group.  It includes bonds ranging from those issued by GE to IBM.
# ''Finance:'' Bonds issued by companies such as banks and insurance companies.  
# ''Yankee Bonds:'' Bonds issued by foreign companies which are denominated in US Dollars. Foreign companies issue Yankee bonds in order to attract US buyers.

==Taxation==

Interest and capital gains from corporate bonds are taxable at both the state and federal level.  This is in contrast to treasury bonds, which are taxable at the federal but not state level, and municipal bonds which can often be exempt from both state and federal taxes.  Investors should therefore take their individual tax situation into account when evaluating corporate bonds vs. other types of bonds.

==Corporate bond prices==

Brokers are required to report their corporate bond trades to FINRA within 15 minutes of the trade.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.finra.org/Industry/Compliance/MarketTransparency/TRACE/FAQ/P125244 Reporting of Corporate and Agencies Debt Frequently Asked Questions], FINRA &lt;/ref&gt;  TRACE  (Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine) is  FINRA’s system for collecting and distributing bond price data. Access to TRACE is freely available to individual investors and can be found [http://finra-markets.morningstar.com/BondCenter/TRACEMarketAggregateStats.jsp here] (enable browser cookies to view).  Many online brokers now offer real time electronic access to executable bond prices as well.  

==Role in a portfolio==

According to Boglehead and financial guru Larry Swedroe, "the evidence shows that corporate bonds have provided very similar returns to Treasuries (credit risk has not been rewarded appropriately)." &lt;ref&gt; Source: [http://moneywatch.bnet.com/investing/blog/irrational-investor/bonds-or-bond-funds-an-easy-choice/873/?tag=col1;blog-river first comment of Alan Roth's article] &lt;/ref&gt;.  Swensen also argues for only including Treasuries in a portfolio.

Other experts, including the authors of the Bogleheads' guides, routinely recommend Vanguard's Total Bond Market fund, which includes a hefty portion of investment-grade corporate bonds.  In a September 2012 interview&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.indexuniverse.com/sections/interviews/14500-bogle-buy-corporate-bonds-with-rates-low.html Bogle: Buy Corporate Bonds With Rates Low], indexuniverse.com &lt;/ref&gt; John Bogle also commented on the attractiveness of corporate bonds at that time.  

As with many situations, there is probably no right answer to the question of whether or not to include corporate bonds in your allocation.  Including them is certainly a perfectly reasonable thing to do, and can add higher yield, albeit at the cost of increased correlation with the equity component of your portfolio.

Unless you have an extremely large portfolio the preferred way to invest in corporate bonds is via a bond fund.  While some investors [[Individual_Bonds_vs_a_Bond_Fund | prefer to hold bonds directly]], for corporate bonds the loss in diversification as compared to a fund makes that choice ill-advised.  A bond fund typically holds thousands of bonds, which diversifies away the un-systematic risk of individual issuers defaulting.  It would be difficult to hold even a tenth as many bonds in all but the largest individual portfolios, leaving bondholders exposed to risk they are not rewarded for taking.

'''Series EE Savings Bonds''' (often called '''EE Bonds''') are government savings bonds issued by the U.S. Treasury. First issued in 1980 as a replacement for the series E Savings Bonds, they have been offered ever since, though the rules applying to the bonds have changed several times. EE Bonds issued after May 2005 earn a fixed rate of interest based on the issue date of the bond. Other forms of treasury securities include [[I savings bonds]] and [[TIPS]].

==Rates and terms==
The rules governing EE Savings Bonds are complex, and have been changed several times since they were first issued. For more information, see [http://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/research/indepth/ebonds/res_e_bonds_eeratesandterms.htm EE/E Bonds Rates &amp; Terms] from TreasuryDirect. To find out what your bonds are worth today, use the [http://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/tools/tools_savingsbondcalc.htm Savings Bond Calculator] or the [http://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/tools/tools_savingsbondwizard.htm Savings Bond Wizard].

===Bonds issued after May 2005===
EE Bonds issued after May 2005 earn a fixed rate in effect at the time of purchase. They must be held for a minimum of one year. Bonds redeemed within five years must pay a 3-month interest penalty. They are guaranteed to double in value in 20 years, which equals a guaranteed return of 3.5% a year. For more information, see [http://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/research/indepth/ebonds/res_e_bonds_eeratesandterms.htm#may2005 rates and terms] from TreasuryDirect.

===Bonds issued between May 1997 and April 2005===
EE Bonds issued between May 1997 and April 2005 earn 90% of the average yields on 5-year Treasury notes for the preceding six months. The rate is adjusted every six months. Bonds redeemed within five years must pay a 3-month interest penalty. EE Bonds issued between May 1995 and May 2003 are guaranteed to double in value in 17 years, which equals a guaranteed return of 4.16% a year. EE Bonds issued after June 1, 2003 are guaranteed to double in value in 20 years, which equals a guaranteed return of 3.5% a year. For more information, see [http://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/research/indepth/ebonds/res_e_bonds_eeratesandterms_eebondsissued051995_042005.htm#may97 rates and terms] from TreasuryDirect.

===Bonds issued between May 1995 and April 1997===
EE Bonds issued between May 1995 and April 1997 earn a short-term rate in the first five years. Between five years and 17 years, the bonds earn a long-term rate. They are guaranteed to double in value in 17 years, which equals a guaranteed return of 4.16% a year. After 17-years, they earn the rates in effect at that time. For more information, see [http://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/research/indepth/ebonds/res_e_bonds_eeratesandterms_eebondsissued051995_042005.htm#may95 rates and terms] from TreasuryDirect.

===Bonds issued before May 1995===
Before May 1995, all EE Bonds issued earned a graduated, fixed rate of interest for the first five years. After five years and until the maturity date, the bonds earned either the guaranteed minimum rate (determined by the date of issue) or a market-based rate, whichever was higher. For more information, see [http://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/research/indepth/ebonds/res_e_bonds_eeratesandterms_eebondsissuedbefore051995.htm rates and terms] from TreasuryDirect.

==Features==
As of January 1, 2012, paper savings bonds are no longer sold. This action supports Treasury’s goal to increase the number of electronic transactions with citizens and businesses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treasurydirect.gov/news/pressroom/pressroom_comotcend0711.htm Treasury to End Over-the-Counter Sales of Paper U.S. Savings Bonds], TreasuryDirect, July 13, 2011, Viewed September 21, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Electronic versions of EE Bonds are available, limited to $10,000 per year per Social Security Number. Savings bonds purchased as gifts aren't included in your annual limit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/research/articles/res_invest_articles_purchaselimits_0406.htm Purchase Limits], from TreasuryDirect.gov.&lt;/ref&gt;
* EE Bonds are not marketable securities, meaning that, unlike other bonds and stocks, you cannot trade EE Bonds in the secondary market.
* EE Bonds are free from state and local taxation. (See below.)

==Where to purchase==
You can buy electronic EE Bonds at [http://www.savingsbonds.gov/indiv/indiv.htm TreasuryDirect].

==How to redeem==
Those wishing to redeem paper savings bonds should first check their financial institution for redemption instructions. Bonds can also be redeemed by mail at the Treasury Retail Securities Site.

Paper bonds can also be converted to electronic form.

Bonds which have not matured, but were lost, stolen or destroyed, must have them reissued in electronic form.

See [http://www.savingsbonds.gov/indiv/products/prod_eebonds_glance.htm Series EE Savings Bonds] for complete details.

==Taxes==
EE Savings Bonds are not subject to state or local taxes, and all federal taxes can be deferred until redemption or the end of the extended maturity period.

===Tax-free growth for qualified education expenses===

If EE Bonds issued after 1989 are redeemed for qualifying education expenses, the interest is completely tax free, provided certain conditions are met. According to [http://www.irs.gov/publications/p970/ch10.html IRS Publication 970, Tax Benefits for Education], the tax-free redemption requires the following conditions to be met:

* You pay qualified educational expenses for yourself, your spouse, or a dependent for whom you claim an exemption on your return.
* Your modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) is less than $92,200 ($145,750 if married filing jointly or qualifying widow(er)).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/uac/about-form-8815 |title=Form 8815, Exclusion of Interest From Series EE and I U.S. Savings Bonds Issued After 1989 |author= IRS |date=Aug 29, 2016 |website=|access-date=18 September 2016}}, Viewed 18-September 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; You cannot exclude any of the interest if your modified adjusted gross income is equal to or more than the upper limit. The phaseout, if any, is figured for you when you fill out [http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f8815.pdf Form 8815]. The MAGI thresholds are adjusted annually.
* Your filing status is not married filing separately.
* The bond must be issued either in your name (as the sole owner) or in the name of both you and your spouse (as co-owners).
* The owner of the Savings Bonds must be at least 24 years old before the bond's issue date. (The issue date is printed on the front of the Savings Bond.)
* The full proceeds of the savings bond redemption (both interest and principal) must be used for qualifying educational expenses.i
Note that redeeming EE Bonds to contribute to a [[529 plan]] or a [[Coverdell Education Savings Accounts (ESAs)|Coverdell education savings account]] is also considered a qualified educational expense. See [http://www.irs.gov/publications/p970/ch10.html Publication 970 (2010), Tax Benefits for Education] for more details.

==Redeeming EE savings bonds==
EE Savings Bonds must be held for 12 months before they can be redeemed; an exception may apply if the bondholder is affected by a disaster such as a flood, fire, hurricane, or tornado.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/research/indepth/ebonds/res_e_bonds_eeredeem_disaster.htm Individual - Redeem or Replace Bonds in Areas Affected by Disaster], Treasury Direct, viewed 2 February 2014. &lt;/ref&gt;

EE Bonds redeemed before five years will lose the last three months of interest.

EE Bonds earn interest for 30 years. After 30 years EE bonds stop earning interest and should be redeemed.

The bonds can be redeemed by following the instructions at TreasuryDirect: [https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/research/indepth/ebonds/res_e_bonds_eeredeem.htm Redeeming (Cashing) EE and E Savings Bonds].

==Role in a portfolio==
An ideal use &lt;nowiki&gt;[in a portfolio]&lt;/nowiki&gt; is to help you to defer taking [[Social Security]]. A rule of thumb is that each year you delay retirement and the onset of your Social Security payments will increase your benefits by 8%. If you buy a $10,000 savings bond each year starting at age 42, you assure yourself $20,000 in annual income beginning at age 62. That can help tide you over until you reach 70, when Social Security payments max out.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2016/09/16/uncle-sam-pays-almost-twice-the-yield-on-treasurys-if-you-know-where-to-look/|title=Uncle Sam Pays Almost Twice the Yield on Treasurys — If You Know Where to Look |last1=Zweig |first1= Jason |date=September 16, 2016 |publisher= Wall Street Journal|access-date=September 18, 2016}} Also see this {{Forum post|t=199723|title="Uncle Sam Pays Almost Twice The Yield On Treasurys--If You Know Where To Look}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Asset class considerations==
The credit instruments used for a ladder should have the following characteristics:
*The bonds should not be subject to credit risk.

A ladder of individual bonds generally includes between 10 and a couple of dozen bonds. That means that each bond represents 2.5% to 10% of a portfolio.

The argument against an investor ever owning individual [[Corporate bonds |corporate]], [[High yield bonds | high yield]], or [[Emerging market bonds | emerging market]] bonds (even in a ladder) is that the effect of a single default (such as a corporation or city brought down by fraud), even if unlikely, could be devastating to the investor's portfolio. For [[Municipal bonds | municipal bonds]] the picture is less clear, as default rates are quite low for investment grade securities;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moodys.com/cust/content/content.ashx?source=StaticContent/Free+pages/Credit+Policy+Research/documents/current/2001700000407258.pdf Moody's US Municipal Bond Rating Scale]&lt;/ref&gt; nevertheless for small-to-medium-sized portfolios, diversification requirements and high [[Bid/ask spread|bid/ask spread]] transaction costs suggest that most investors would be best served by holding municipal bonds in low cost diversified mutual funds.

*The bonds should not be [[Bond basics#Call risk |callable]].

The most frequently recommended bond instruments for bond ladders are [[Treasury Bonds |Treasury]] bonds (including [[TIPS]]).{{citation needed}} As all Treasury bonds are explicitly backed by the US government, they have the highest possible credit rating. Most Treasuries also are not subject to call risk, and if purchased at auction, have no transaction costs. FDIC-backed certificates of deposit (CDs) are also appropriate instruments for a ladder.

==Types of ladders==

===Non-rolling ladder===

A non-rolling ladder is a bond ladder in which bonds are not rolled over to new bonds at the prevailing rate.

===Rolling ladder===

In a rolling ladder, as bonds mature they are replaced with bonds of similar maturity, so that the duration of the ladder remains approximately constant. This type of ladder is essentially [[Individual Bonds vs a Bond Fund | equivalent to a bond fund]], with the added advantage that it can be converted to a non-rolling ladder at no cost by simply failing to roll over bonds as they mature.&lt;ref group ="note" name="Ally"&gt;A graphical example of a rolling ladder can be seen at [http://www.ally.com/bank/cd-ladder/#tabs=step-by-step Ally's website].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treasury bond ladders==

Treasury bond ladders have the following advantages:
# An investor saves the mutual fund fees;
# If bought at auction there are no bid-offer spreads;
#For taxable accounts there is the ability to tax loss harvest at the individual security level; treasury interest is state tax exempt;
#You can target the specific maturity and cash flow you want/need.&lt;ref&gt;[http://moneywatch.bnet.com/investing/blog/irrational-investor/bonds-or-bond-funds-an-easy-choice/873/?tag=col1;blog-river Bond or bond funds: an easy choice, comment one-Larry Swedroe]&lt;/ref&gt;

===How to establish a bond ladder===
Lets say that you have $100,000 to invest and want to set up a 5 year bond ladder. To start you would invest $20,000 in each of 5 bonds ranging from 1 to 5 years in maturity. The 5 bonds would each represent 1 “rung” in the ladder. At the end of the first year after setting up the ladder, and for each of the four years after that, one bond would mature giving you back the principal that you invested in the bond. 

If you would like to keep the ladder going, then at the end of each year, you would reinvest the principal you receive back from the bond that matures into a new 5 year bond.

===Buying treasuries at auction===
The auction dates are published in the [http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/quarterly-refunding/Documents/auctions.pdf Tentative Auction Schedule of U.S. Treasury Securities].&lt;ref&gt;The schedule of Treasury securities auctions is released at the Treasury's Quarterly Refunding press conference, usually held on the first Wednesday of February, May, August, and November.&lt;/ref&gt; A few days before the auction date, the Treasury Department also publishes a formal [http://treasurydirect.gov/instit/annceresult/press/press_secannpr.htm announcement]. The announcement includes details of the security being offered. If it's a new issue, both the price and the coupon interest rate will be determined by the auction. The coupon rate is set to nearest 0.125% below the high yield from the auction. If it's a re-opening, the coupon interest rate is already known. The auction will set the yield which in turn determines the price. 

After the announcement date but before the auction cutoff time, retail investors can place auction orders through [http://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/indiv.htm TreasuryDirect] or through a brokerage account. [http://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/indiv.htm TreasuryDirect] charges no fee but it only handles taxable accounts. If you want to buy in an IRA, you must use a brokerage account, which can also handle taxable accounts.

After the auction, the Treasury Department makes another announcement for the auction result. The settlement date is at least one day after the auction date. You must have enough cash available on the settlement date to pay for the bonds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/research/indepth/res_auctions_indepth.htm Treasury Direct: Auctions In Depth] &lt;/ref&gt;

=== Buying treasuries on the secondary market ===
You can also buy Treasuries at any time on the secondary market through a brokerage account. The prices from the brokers include a markup over what institutions pay for larger trades. Some brokers also charge a separate commission on top of the markup. TreasuryDirect does not handle secondary market purchases although you can sell your existing holdings on the secondary market through its [http://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/help/tdhelp/help_ug_263-SellDirectLearnMore.htm SellDirect] service (fees and restrictions apply).

The following link shows some current Treasury notes pricing and yields available in the secondary market.

With a normal yield curve, long-dated CDs have a higher yield than shorter-dated ones. However, long-dated CDs, by definition, lock your money into an illiquid holding. A ladder provides a way to take advantage of the highest-yielding CDs while improving liquidity of (access to) your money.

Typically, you create a ladder by splitting your money into 5 parts, and purchasing CDs of 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 year duration. When the 1 year CD matures, you use the money to purchase a new 5 year CD. After 4 years, you have all of your money invested in 5 year CDs, but 1/5th of your money is available every year. As each CD matures, you can decide whether to reinvest it in all or in part. This is a rolling ladder as defined [[#Rolling ladder | above]].&lt;ref group ="note" name="Ally" /&gt;

If you want quicker access to your money, you can also set up a 1-year ladder, with rungs at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months.

Each time a CD matures, you can purchase the highest yielding new CD you can find (known as "riding the yield curve"). In a normal yield curve, that will be the longest dated one. But in an inverted yield curve, the shortest term CD may have a higher rate. You can even [[Certificate_of_Deposit#Yield_Chasing | chase yields]] by moving your money to whatever bank is offering the best rate at that moment.

===CD ladder alternatives===
When interest rates are low, the penalties imposed for redeeming CDs early ("breaking a CD") are also low. A point may be reached where the return of a CD redeemed early is better than purchasing one for the equivalent maturity date.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=824203#824203 CD Ladder Strategy - how to handle gaps, long term rates?], forum discussion&lt;/ref&gt;

For example: A 3.49 % 7-year CD with a 12 month interest penalty is redeemed after 3 years. The return (with penalty) is 2.31%. A 3 year CD is offered at 2.00%. Breaking a 7-year CD after 3 years instead of purchasing a 3-year CD results in a higher return by 0.31%.

In this case, it may be more advantageous to purchase multiple CDs at the longest term (highest rate) and break them early. A [[:Comparing CDs#Spreadsheet overview | spreadsheet]] can be used to evaluate if ladders, multiple CDs (non-ladder), or other scenarios are best.

'''Zero coupon bonds''' are [[Bond basics|bonds]] that do not pay interest during the life of the bonds. Instead, investors buy zero coupon bonds at a deep discount from their face value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/investing-basics/glossary/zero-coupon-bond| title=Zero Coupon Bond| publisher=Investor.gov| accessdate=September 17, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics of zero coupon bonds==

* Zero-coupon bonds or "zeros" result from the separation of coupons from the body of a security. Consequently, from a single coupon-paying bond, two bonds result: one which pays the coupons but returns no principal at maturity (an annuity), and one which pays no coupons but returns the par value at maturity (a zero-coupon bond).
* Zeroes sell at discounts from face value.
* The difference between the purchase price of the zero and its face value when redeemed is the investor's return.
* Zeroes can be purchased from private brokers and dealers, but not from the Federal Reserve or any government agency.&lt;ref name="STRIPS"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://treasurydirect.gov/marketable-securities/strips/| title=STRIPS — TreasuryDirect| publisher=TreasuryDirect| accessdate=September 17, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Zeros have the unique property of having a [[Bonds: advanced topics#Duration|duration]] equal to their maturity. This has several consequences for investors:
** A bond of a given maturity has much greater exposure to interest rate changes than a coupon-paying bond. For instance, a 30-year bond with a 5% coupon has a duration of just over 15 years; by contrast, a 30-year zero has a duration of 30 years. Therefore, in a deflationary crisis where long-term Treasuries are expected to do well, zero-coupon Treasuries (STRIPS) will be the best performers.
** The duration of a zero, unlike coupon-paying bonds or bond funds (excepting a few target-date bond funds), keeps pace with the reductions in investment horizon as time passes. This property makes zeroes precisely suited for investing to meet a known, fixed future obligation. The lack of availability of inflation-indexed zeroes, however, limits the utility of this property to satisfying only known, fixed, future obligations valued in nominal dollars. It is possible to create a portfolio of individual bonds or of bond funds that approximates this property of zeroes by [[Individual_Bonds_vs_a_Bond_Fund | periodic rebalancing between bonds/funds of different durations]], although such a scheme leaves the investor subject to yield curve shifts. Creating a declining-duration portfolio of TIPS, however, would allow the reasonably certain satisfaction of a future obligation valued in real dollars.

==Treasury STRIPS==

The U.S. Treasury initially opposed stripping of Treasuries into coupon-only bonds (known as annuities) and maturity-only bonds (zeros), because the zero-coupon bonds could be used to exploit a tax loophole. The 1982 Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act closed this loophole, however, and the same year several private firms were able to create unsanctioned versions on the private market. These issues were not interchangeable on the secondary bond market, making them fairly illiquid. A consortium of primary dealers came together and issued interchangeable zeroes known as Treasury Receipts. In 1985, the Treasury eventually created an authorized version known as STRIPS (Separate Trading of Registered Interest and Principal of Securities),&lt;ref name="STRIPS" /&gt; which has replaced the proprietary issues; the program continues to this day. All Treasury issues of 10-year maturity or greater are eligible for stripping. Because STRIPS cannot be purchased directly from the Treasury, purchasers cannot avoid [[Bid/ask spread|bid/ask spread]]s.

===TIPS STRIPS===

The Treasury&lt;ref name="STRIPS" /&gt; does facilitate "stripping" [[Treasury Inflation Protected Securities | TIPS]], but no functioning market for TIPS STRIPS exists. Barclays Capital created a stripped TIPS known as iStrips, but they did not sell well and the product was discontinued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://seekingalpha.com/article/107144-tips-strips-redux| title=Barclays Capital created a stripped TIPS| publisher=Seeking Alpha| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222203849/http://seekingalpha.com/article/107144-tips-strips-redux| archive-date=December 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Zero-coupon corporate bonds==

Zero-coupon corporate bonds are most prevalent in the [[High_Yield_Bonds | high-yield market]], where their lack of coupon payments in the first several years provides liquidity in a key period for bonds used to finance acquisitions, restructuring, or other immediate cash flow needs. Many high-yield zero-coupon bonds have a structure which reflects this time series, and in fact begin making coupon payments after 3-7 years of couponless existence. 

Zero-coupon bonds, when combined with the call option prevalent in most high-yield securities, cannot be used to provide absolutely certain nominal returns at a given date that zeroes are often used to provide, as an increase in the credit rating of the issuer or a decrease in interest rates would prompt the issuer to call the bond prematurely. They also cannot be used to gain greater exposure to interest rate shifts (e.g. to protect against deflationary crises) as one part of a portfolio, because the negative [[Bonds: advanced topics#Convexity | convexity]] exhibited by bonds with call options alters the picture somewhat and in ways not favorable to the investor.

==Zero-coupon municipal bonds==

Municipal zero-coupon bonds exist, including bonds called "municipal multipliers," in which coupon payments are made but re-invested at the bond's yield. These variations are generally in place to avoid legal restrictions on the amount of liability that issuers were allowed to create.

Another variation of a municipal zero-coupon bond is the Convertible Zero Coupon Municipal Bond (varieties include GAINS (Growth and Income Securities): FIGS (Future Income and Growth Securities)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.allbusiness.com/glossaries/zero-coupon-security/4947891-1.html| title=Dictionary of Banking Terms for: zero-coupon security| publisher=allBusiness.com| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190118091916/https://www.allbusiness.com/barrons_dictionary/dictionary-zero-coupon-security-4947891-1.html| archive-date=January 18, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; and STAIRS (stepped tax-exempt appreciation on income realization securities).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalappreciation.asp| title=Capital Appreciation: Meaning, Types and Examples| publisher=Investopedia| accessdate=September 17, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt; These bonds start as zero coupon bonds and then, generally after eight to 15 years, convert to interest-paying bonds. These bonds appeal to retirement investors who like the tax exempt appreciation of the security up to a retirement date, followed by a conversion to a coupon paying security that provides an income stream during retirement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.investinginbonds.com/learnmore.asp?catid=5&amp;subcatid=27&amp;id=148| title=Variations of Zero Coupon Municipal Bonds| publisher=InvestinginBonds.com}}{{dead link}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tax aspects==

Zeroes do not return the accrued interest until the bond matures, but the IRS taxes the income as it is accumulates each year. Therefore, zeroes are best held in tax-advantaged accounts to escape this taxation on "phantom income." STRIPS, as issues of the Treasury, are exempt from state and local taxation. Zero-coupon bonds issued by municipalities may be exempt from Federal taxation as well.

==Zero-coupon bond funds==

As of 2025, American Century offers a target dated zero-coupon bond fund, set to mature and liquidate by a fixed maturity target date. Although it is convenient to purchase as a mutual fund, carefully compare the 0.57% [[Expense ratios | expense ratio]] (which is paid every year) to the commission and [[Bid/ask spread|bid/ask spread]] of purchasing a zero-coupon bond directly. In many cases (particularly long-dated bonds where you are planning to hold to maturity), purchasing the bond directly will likely cost less.

*[https://www.americancentury.com/funds/fund_facts.jsp?fund=968 American Century Zero Coupon 2025 (BTTRX)], expense ratio (0.57%) 

Vanguard offers an index fund, the [{{Vf | vedtx}} Extended Duration Treasury Index Fund], based on the Bloomberg U.S. Treasury STRIPS 20–30 Year Equal Par Bond Index. Unlike the American Century funds, this fund has no set maturity date, as the maturity is meant to remain at around 25 years. The fund is only available in institutional and ETF shares.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''', also known as Ginnie Mae, and formally as [https://www.ginniemae.gov/pages/default.aspx Government National Mortgage Association], is a U.S. government corporation within the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). 

Ginnie May aims to: 
# Ensure liquidity for government-insured mortgages, including those insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), the Veterans Administration (VA) and the Rural Housing Administration (RHA). 
# Bring investors' capital into the market for these types of loans, so that the issuers have the means to issue more.

Investopedia explains:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/ginniemae.asp| title=Government National Mortgage Association (Ginnie Mae): History and Programs| publisher=Investopedia| accessdate=July 9, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quotation|Most of the mortgages securitized as Ginnie Mae mortgage-backed securities (MBSs) are those guaranteed by FHA, which are typically mortgages for first-time home buyers and low-income borrowers.

Ginnie Mae neither issues, sells or buys pass-through mortgage-backed securities, nor does it purchase mortgage loans. It simply guarantees (insures) the timely payment of principal and interest from approved issuers  (such as mortgage bankers, savings and loans, and commercial banks) of qualifying loans, such as those issued by the FHA and RHA.

Unlike its cousins [[Freddie Mac]], [[Fannie Mae]] and Sallie Mae, Ginnie Mae is not a publicly-traded company. An investor in a GNMA [[Financial securities|security]] will not know who the underlying issuer of the mortgages is, but merely that the security is guaranteed by GNMA, which is backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S government, just like U.S. Treasuries.}}

'''Treasury bonds''' and Treasury notes are two types of marketable [[United States Treasury security |United States Treasury securities]]. The Treasury issues both [[Nominal bond|nominal bonds]], the subject of this article, and [[Treasury Inflation Protected Security|inflation-protected bonds]].&lt;ref group="note"&gt; Government agencies also issue debt, some of which is backed by the full faith and credit of the government and some of which is not&lt;/ref&gt; Treasury bonds possess the advantages inherent in treasury securities: the bonds are backed by the full faith and credit of the US government;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://treasurydirect.gov/about/| title=About| publisher=TreasuryDirect| accessdate=August 1, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt; treasury bond interest income is exempt from state and local income tax; and treasury bonds currently being issued are not [[Wikipedia:Callable bond | callable]]; although some older issues available on the secondary market are callable.

Nominal Treasury bonds are issued in two maturity ranges:
*Notes have a range between one year and ten years;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.treasurydirect.gov/marketable-securities/treasury-notes/| title=Treasury Notes| publisher=TreasuryDirect| accessdate=August 1, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this article both notes and bonds are referred to as "bonds". 

==Purchasing bonds==

Treasury bonds can be purchased through brokerages and banks, as well as through an individual or entity account at [https://www.treasurydirect.gov/ TreasuryDirect]. However, TreasuryDirect cannot be used to purchase bonds intended for IRAs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://treasurydirect.gov/laws-and-regulations/department-circulars/| title=Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Department Circulars| publisher=TreasuryDirect| accessdate=August 1, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text bytes="5810" sha1="idyds6n3n1tg7b2qr6ia8872l691981" xml:space="preserve">While '''[[CD]]s''' are often thought of as different assets than '''bonds''', in reality they are simply bonds with special characteristics. This article looks at the differences and similarities.

Because CDs, like U.S. Treasuries, are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government (when [[CD#Credit risk | purchased properly]]), [[Treasury bond]]s are the appropriate comparison. 

The following primarily applies to un-brokered CDs of greater than 1 year maturity, with no particularly exotic options (for example, a simple coupon-paying CD with no call option). As this is by far the most common type of CD, and is what most people mean when they say "CD," this will allow the analysis to be simple yet relevant.

== Characteristics and risks ==

In general, assuming yields are equal, CDs perform better if interest rates rise (because of their put option&lt;ref group="note"&gt;An option contract giving the owner the right, but not the obligation, to sell a specified amount of an underlying security at a specified price within a specified time. [http://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/putoption.asp Put Option], from [http://www.investopedia.com/ Investopedia]&lt;/ref&gt; and because if the bank fails you get the par value back, not the lower present value), whereas Treasuries are preferred if interest rates fall (since their liquidity means you do not have to wait until maturity to profit from the rate change and because if the bank fails you get their higher present value back rather than the par value).
* '''Liquidity''' - Treasuries are the most liquid bond market in the world. CDs, by contrast, cannot typically be traded; brokered CDs exist but have fairly high spreads. In a rising rate environment, this lack of liquidity is not a problem if the CD has a put option (see below). In a falling rate environment, however, liquidating the CD for purposes such as rebalancing, tax management, or funding unexpected life events, becomes costly (at risk is exactly equivalent to the increase in market value of a bond in a falling rate environment).
*''' Options''' - Many CDs have a put option which allows the investor to receive the deposit back from the bank in exchange for a penalty (typically 3-6 months of interest payments). In a rising rate environment this can be a valuable feature of CDs since it allows the investor to invest in a new higher yielding CD. Be certain that any put option is a contractual agreement at the sole discretion of the bondholder in the Truth in Savings disclosure; vague suggestions not embodied in the contract on this point are apparently common. Often CDs have a "death put" that can be useful in estate planning. Treasuries no longer have embedded call options&lt;ref group="note"&gt;An agreement that gives an investor the right (but not the obligation) to buy a stock, bond, commodity, or other instrument at a specified price within a specific time period. [http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/calloption.asp Call Option], from [http://www.investopedia.com/ Investopedia]&lt;/ref&gt; and most CDs do not have call options, so if interest rates decline the investor can continue to hold the higher yielding note or CD to maturity. However, CDs are subject to a certain type of call risk--the risk that if a bank fails the FDIC might not continue to honor the terms of the original CD agreements, especially if the CD offered premium rates. The amount at risk is exactly equivalent to the increase in market value of a bond in a falling rate environment.
*'''Reinvestment risk''' - Most CDs include an option to reinvest coupon payments at the CD's rate. Bonds, by contrast, pay a coupon which must be reinvested by the individual, generally at lower rates (unless the yield curve is inverted). This also leaves the investor exposed to [[Bond basics#Reinvestment risk | reinvestment risk]] of the [[Bond basics#Sources of return | interest-on-interest]] component of bond returns. Because of this difference, however, care should be used in comparing rates of bonds vs. CDs to ensure the APY of one is compared to the APY of the other.
* '''Purchasing convenience''' - Some individuals prefer dealing directly with their local bank when buying a CD; others prefer dealing with a broker of their choice. Another consideration in convenience is that CD yields vary widely depending on the issuer, and time must be spent locating the highest yield (and switching between institutions to seek out the highest yield). Treasuries can be bought at auction, often at zero cost, from a bank, brokerage account, or Treasury Direct. The treasury investor faces transaction costs if the security is sold on the market prior to maturity; the CD investor faces early withdrawal penalties for cashing in the CD prior to maturity.
* '''Credit risk''' - Both CDs and Treasuries are obligations of the U.S. Government, and are therefore considered to have no credit risk. CDs must remain under [[Certificate of Deposit#Credit_risk | certain purchase limits]] to maintain this feature.
* '''Taxation''' - Treasury bills and notes are exempt from state taxation; CDs are subject to both federal and state taxation.

== Market history ==

Because CDs cater primarily to the individual investor market, whereas Treasuries can be traded in large volumes by institutional investors as well, and because the characteristics of the bonds differ (particularly with regards to taxation, liquidity and options), yields on Treasuries and on CDs are never exactly alike.

Market data for CDs can be difficult to come by, because for the individual investor a little time searching can often yield above-average rates in the CD rate.

{{for|additional information|wikipedia:Certificate of deposit}}

A '''certificate of deposit''' (CD) is a debt instrument issued by a bank or a credit union. A CD has a fixed interest rate, for a fixed period, and paid monthly, quarterly, or annually. CDs at credit unions are sometimes called '''money market certificates'''. Unlike a [[Money markets | money market fund]], there is no credit risk with a money market certificate as long as you stay within the [[deposit insurance]] guarantee.

You can also consider CDs as a form of [[Bond basics|bond]]. For more on this, see [[CDs vs bonds]].

==Role in a portfolio==
The main reasons you might use CDs are:
* A general savings account. If you know the date on which you need a large amount of cash (for example, to buy a car, for college tuition, for a vacation, and so on), you might consider opening a CD that will mature just before that date.
* A part of your fixed income allocation in a retirement portfolio. CDs are simply bonds with special characteristics; see [[CDs vs bonds]] for more. [[Laddering bonds or CDs | Laddering]] is a common way to hold CDs in a portfolio.

==Risks==

===Credit risk===
If you use them correctly, CDs do not have credit risk. Only bank accounts and [[Treasury bond| treasury bonds]] share this enormously valuable feature of a government guarantee.

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insures CDs from qualified bank. The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) insures CDs from qualified credit unions. You can verify that the institution you are buying from is covered by FDIC or NCUA by checking their status:
* FDIC: [https://banks.data.fdic.gov/bankfind-suite/ BankFind Suite]
* NCUA: [https://mapping.ncua.gov/ResearchCreditUnion Research a Credit Union]

The standard insurance amount is $250,000 per depositor, per insured bank, for each account ownership category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.fdic.gov/resources/deposit-insurance/understanding-deposit-insurance/| title=FDIC: Understanding Deposit Insurance| publisher=FDIC| accessdate=August 26, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If you want to safely invest more than $250,000 at the same institution, you can do this using payable-on-death (POD) labeling. For example, a couple with two children can insure $2.5&amp;nbsp;million. They would hold a joint CD with $500,000, an individual CD each, three CDs for her POD for each of him, child one and child two; and three CDs for him POD each of her, child one and child two. Details are at the [https://www.depositaccounts.com/blog/more-about-extending-fdic-and-ncua.html Bankdeals blog] and the [https://www.fdic.gov/resources/deposit-insurance/understanding-deposit-insurance/#revocable FDIC]. The FDIC Insurance Electronic Deposit Insurance Estimator ([https://edie.fdic.gov/ EDIE]) can help make sure you do this right.

Banks fail regularly and so it is critical to take these rules seriously. Do not ever buy CDs greater than the insurance guarantee or at a non-guaranteed institution. In particular, there are a small number of credit unions that are not insured by the NCUA. Even if these credit unions offered slightly higher rates on their CDs (and they generally do not), it is not worth losing the government guarantee. If you have large amounts of money to invest in CDs, investigate the private [[wikipedia:IntraFi Network|IntraFi Network]],&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Formerly [[wikipedia:Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service|Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service]] (CDARS). Reconfigured into [[wikipedia:IntraFi Network|IntraFi Network]] in 2021.&lt;/ref&gt; which automatically distributes your money across a large number of institutions.

===Inflation risk===
CDs are effectively nominal [[Bond basics | bonds]] and have inflation risk. The bank promises that you will receive the stated interest payments for the life of the CD, and the principal at maturity, but there is no guarantee that the future dollars will be worth as much as present dollars. (Also, in the case of bank failure, the FDIC only guarantees return of your principal and accumulated interest; sometimes the new bank that takes over the CD cuts the interest rate.)
 
You can partially mitigate inflation risk by redeeming CD prior to its maturity date. Early redemption creates a penalty, in the form reduction in the accrued interest. However, depending on market conditions, such as higher interest rates, it can be beneficial for you to redeem an existing CD early (known as "breaking" the CD) so that you can then use a more attractive alternative. For more, see: [[Comparing CDs]].

===Early withdrawal penalty===
[[File:Form1099-INT.gif|thumb|500px|Figure 1. Form 1099-INT]]
If you need money in your CD before it matures, or wish to redeem the CD early to reinvest at higher rates, you may have to pay an early withdrawal penalty. According to a survey conducted by Bankrate.com,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.bankrate.com/brm/news/investing/20061208_cd_early_withdrawal_main_a1.asp| title=CD early withdrawal penalties survey| publisher=Bankrate.com| date=December 8, 2006| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070102000354/http://www.bankrate.com/brm/news/investing/20061208_cd_early_withdrawal_main_a1.asp| archive-date=January 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; early withdrawal penalties vary widely. The most common penalties are three months and six months of interest.

Usually you report the full interest payment from a CD as taxable income. The early withdrawal penalty is deductible as an adjustment to income on a federal income tax return. Box 2 of your 1099-INT form (see Figure 1) will show the early withdrawal penalty. 

==Taxation==
If you hold them in a taxable account, interest from CDs is taxed federally as ordinary income. Unlike money market funds, there are no tax-exempt CDs. Taxation at the state level varies. Some states may exempt interest from in-state banks.

==Buying CDs==
When buying CDs, there is a trade-off between convenience and yield. You have a few options.

=== Your local bank or credit union ===
When you save money for a specific future cash need, it can be simplest to purchase a CD with money from your checking account. These rates are always better than checking account interest, but often are not very good. Also, beware of "teaser" rates that automatically roll-over into much lower yielding CDs when they mature. You often have just ten days or so to stop a roll-over, so be sure to mark your calendar.

=== Out of town banks or credit unions ===
Different banks and credit unions around the country are constantly offering special deals to attract new customers. If you are willing to fill out the paperwork, you can get the highest yield CDs by moving your money to whichever bank is offering the best deal as your old CD matures. Many banks now offer online setup and ACH money transfers, although the paperwork to move an IRA is often more difficult.

The best source for finding bank deals is at [https://www.depositaccounts.com/ DepositAccounts.com]. There, you can see a list of all deals available for the length CD you want. Many deals are only for residents of certain states or cities, or people affiliated to some employer or group.

===Brokered CDs===
{{Warning| Brokered CDs are designed to be held until maturity.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Consider the maturity date carefully when purchasing a brokered CD for an IRA. If you have to make a [[Required Minimum Distribution]] before maturity, you would need to sell the CD. See this {{Forum link|p=2284513|title= Re: Can you lose money by buying CDs?| author=LadyGeek| date=September 7, 2019}}.&lt;/ref&gt; You can sell CDs before maturity on the secondary market (which may be limited). All brokered CDs will fluctuate in value between purchase and maturity. As a result, you could see a substantial gain or loss on any CD sold before maturity. A brokered CD's value can decline because of rising interest rates, and longer maturities have higher interest rate risk. See {{forum link| t=152258| title=Vanguard cd question &lt;nowiki&gt;[Brokered CDs]&lt;/nowiki&gt;}} for additional information. Ask in the forum if you are unsure.}}
Brokers sometimes negotiate a higher interest rate on bank-issued CDs because they can bring a large amount of deposits to the bank. But CDs sold by brokers can be complex, and may carry more risks than traditional CDs sold directly by banks, especially your ability to lock in an attractive interest rate or get your money back early.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.fdic.gov/consumers/consumer/news/cnspr13/cdsfrombrokers.html| title=When a Broker Offers a Bank CD: It Pays to Do Some Research| publisher=FDIC| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230331212715/https://www.fdic.gov/consumers/consumer/news/cnspr13/cdsfrombrokers.html| archive-date=March 31, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sec"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.sec.gov/reportspubs/investor-publications/investorpubscertific| title=High-Yield CDs – Protect Your Money by Checking the Fine Print| publisher=SEC| date=December 3, 2008| accessdate=August 26, 2023}} See the ''Special Considerations for Brokered CDs'' section.&lt;/ref&gt;

Federal deposit insurance is limited to a total aggregate amount of $250,000 for each depositor in each bank or thrift institution. It is therefore very important that you know which institution issued your CD. Find out where your broker plans to deposit your money; they might put it into a bank or thrift where you already have CDs or other deposits. If the brokered CD increases your total deposits with that institution above the $250,000 federal deposit insurance limit, you would no longer be fully insured.&lt;ref name="sec"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Good account records by your deposit broker can ensure your CD will have federal deposit insurance and, if a bank closes, you will be paid quickly. Unlike traditional bank CDs, brokered CDs are sometimes held by a group of unrelated investors. Instead of owning the entire CD, each investor owns a portion of the total. Confirm with your broker how your CD is held, and be sure to ask for a copy of the exact title of the CD. If several investors own the CD, the deposit broker will probably not list each person's name in the title. But you should make sure that the account records reflect that the broker is merely acting as an agent for you and the other owners (for example, "XYZ Brokerage as Custodian for Customers"). This will ensure that your portion of the CD qualifies for full federal deposit insurance coverage.&lt;ref name="sec" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{forum link| t=49200| title=Brokered Deposits / CDs -- Proper Documentation| date=January 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A brokered CD may not reinvest the interest payments, such as depositing the money into a separate [[money market]] account. In this case, the CD's interest rate is calculated as simple interest (the same amount every payment period). The total return of the CD should include the interest paid by the separate account.

====Vanguard Brokerage Services====

Vanguard and other brokerage firms offer brokered CDs from hundreds of different banks. All CDs available through [https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/cds Vanguard Brokerage Service] are FDIC or NCUA insured (though you must stay below the limits). Brokers deposits interest payments (which are often made monthly) into the money market linked to your brokerage account.

The downside is that the very best deals are not available as brokered CDs. You will generally do better than your local bank, but not as well as if you search out the very best deals.

'''{{PAGENAME}}'''s are capital preservation investment options available in 401(k) plans and other types of savings plans. The funds are comprised of high quality, diversified fixed income portfolios that are protected against interest rate volatility by contracts from banks and insurance companies. Stable value funds are designed to preserve capital while providing steady, positive returns. Stable value funds are conservative and are considered one of the lowest risk investment options offered in 401(k) plans.

The investment objective of stable value funds is to provide capital preservation and predictable steady, returns. During 2008, stable value funds were one of the few 401(k) investments that produced a positive
return. Stable value fund returns generally ranged between 3 to 5 percent for 2008.&lt;ref name="FAQ"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20121122012934/http://stablevalue.org/help-desk/faq/ Stable Value FAQ, What Do You Need to Know about Stable Value Funds In Today’s Challenging Financial Environment?] (web archive), from [http://stablevalue.org/ Stable Value Investment Association].&lt;/ref&gt;

They have return stability similar to a money market fund but generate higher returns. The protection from interest rate volatility is universal and unique to stable value funds.

Stable value funds are offered in approximately half of all [[:401(k)]] plans and some [[:Category:529 plans| 529]] tuition savings plans. Individuals have invested $520 billion in stable value funds through 138,000 [[:Employer Retirement Plans Overview#Defined Contribution Plan | defined contribution plans]], which include [[:457]], [[:403(b)|403(b)]] and [[:401(k)]] plans.&lt;ref name="FAQ"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

All investments have risks associated with them. Stable value funds are considered one of the lowest risk investments offered in 401(k) plans. Because of their low risk and stable, consistent returns they can help diversify 401(k) asset allocation.&lt;ref name="FAQ"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
Stable value funds are structured in two ways: as a separately managed account, which is a stable value fund managed for one specific 401(k) plan; or as a commingled fund, which pools together assets from many 401(k) plans. Commingled funds offer the benefits of diversification and economies of scale for smaller plans.&lt;ref name="FAQ"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Regardless of how stable value funds are structured, they are comprised of a diversified portfolio of fixed income securities that are insulated from interest rate movements by contracts from banks and insurance companies. The protection from interest rate volatility is universal to stable value funds. How this contract protection is delivered depends on the type of stable value fund investment purchased. The contract protection against interest rate volatility is provided through the following investment instruments:&lt;ref name="FAQ"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

*&lt;u&gt;Guaranteed Interest Contract (GIC)&lt;/u&gt;
:A contract with an insurance company that provides principal preservation and a specified rate of return over a set period of time, regardless of the performance of the underlying invested assets. The invested assets are owned by the insurance company and held within the insurer’s general account.

*&lt;u&gt;Separate Account Contract&lt;/u&gt;
:An account held by an insurance company that holds a combination of fixed income securities and provides principal preservation and a specified rate of return over a set period of time. Separate accounts may provide either a fixed rate of return or a periodic rate of return based on the performance of the underlying assets. The assets are owned by the insurance company and are set aside in a separate account solely for the benefit of the specific contract holder.

*&lt;u&gt;Synthetic GIC&lt;/u&gt;
:A diversified portfolio of fixed income securities that are insulated from interest rate volatility by contracts (wraps) from banks and insurance companies. In this arrangement, the 401(k) plan and its participants own the underlying invested assets-the portfolio of fixed income securities that support the stable value fund.

The typical stable value fund will diversify contract protection by investing in more than one instrument type and/or with more than one insurance company or bank.

==Risks==

* Default risk - Insurers which provide the contracts can go bankrupt.  This risk is highest in funds using non-synthetic GICs.  While most stable value funds attempt to diversify this risk by purchasing contracts from multiple insurers,  the risk still exists (particularly since all the firms will be in the same industry--insurance).
* Interest rate lag - While book value accounting prevents NAV losses during rising rate periods, it equally prevents gains during falling rate periods.
* Liquidity risk - Because much of the stability of stable value funds is due to book value accounting, plans often limit withdrawals to certain time periods.

==Regulation==
Stable value funds have multiple layers of government oversight. The vast majority of funds are regulated by the Department of Labor’s Employee Benefits Security Administration and must comply with the federal pension law, [[:Employee Retirement Income Security Act - ERISA | Employee Retirement Security Act (ERISA)]]. Stable value funds in [[:Employer Retirement Plans Overview#Defined Contribution Plan | defined contribution plans]] for state and local governments-[[:457(b) | 457 plans]]-are regulated by the states, which have adopted requirements similar to ERISA.&lt;ref name="FAQ"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the Department of Labor, stable value investment structures provided and/or managed by:
* banks are regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of Currency,
* insurance companies are regulated by the various state insurance departments, and
* commingled investment funds are regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Investment Company Act.

All stable value funds must comply with accounting regulations by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) (for corporate defined contribution plans) or the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) (for state and local defined contribution plans) to qualify for contract value accounting and reporting. Generally, FASB and GASB require that a stable value fund must meet all of the following criteria:
* the contract is effected directly between the fund and issuer and prohibits the sale or assignment of the contract or its proceeds to another party without the consent of the issuer;
* the repayment of principal and interest credited to participants in the fund is a financial obligation of the issuer of the contract. Prospective interest-crediting rate adjustments are permitted as long as they are not less than zero, and the contract issuer must be a financially sound institution;
* the terms of the contract require all permitted participant-initiated transactions with the fund to occur at contract value;
* an event that limits the ability of the fund to transact at contract value with the issuer and limits the ability of the fund to transact at contract value with participants in the fund must not be probable of occurring;
* the fund itself must allow participants reasonable access to their funds.

==Role in a portfolio==
While stable value funds generally do not contain bonds (except in the case of synthetic GICs), they are based on bonds, and their fixed income and low volatility make them ideally suited for the "bond" portion of a portfolio.

==Transfer restrictions==
Be sure to check your employer's plan description regarding stable value funds, as there may be (normally) a 90 day transfer restriction with other accounts.

The intent of this restriction is to force investors to put their money "at risk" before taking advantage of the interest rate spread (difference) between the "stable" value rate and a short term rate of another fund, such as a Money Market fund.

Although both money Market Market and Stable Value funds attempt to maintain a stable asset value, the Stable Value funds invest farther along the yield curve and with the help of insurance contracts. The cost of liquidating these assets in an environment of rising interest rates is expensive to the fund and its remaining investors.

Other investment choices, such as short term and intermediate bond funds, make no pretense of maintaining a "stable net asset value". It is understood that these investments can and will lose money on a day to day basis and are therefore inappropriate for comparison with Stable Value funds.&lt;ref&gt;Forum discussion: [http://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=49556 Stable Value Funds within a 401(k) and transfer restrictions]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text bytes="2238" sha1="krmkppgrkyfy13sorwt42s2ffbdtqyg" xml:space="preserve">Questions about bonds come up frequently in the Bogleheads forum, which is appropriate since they are, together with stocks, the most important part of your [[:Category:Asset allocation | asset allocation]].  Due to the unique nature of bonds, these questions are often impossible to answer accurately without knowing considerably more information.  The question may seem simple, but the answer must often take into account how the bonds work within a portfolio, tax considerations, and the timeline for the money.  Therefore this page should serve as a guide when asking bond questions which will ensure you get as many answers as possible and the answers are as helpful and personalized to your situation as they can be.

== Learning the basics ==
# Decide on a bond [[:Category:Asset allocation | allocation]] and the [[:Category:Bonds | role of bonds]] in your portfolio
# Be sure to understand the major [[Bond basics#Risks | risks]] of bonds.
# Try to understand the concept of [[Bonds: advanced topics#Duration|duration]].
# Appreciate that bond funds do not [[Individual_Bonds_vs_a_Bond_Fund | behave any differently]] than rolling ladders of individual bonds.

== Questions to ask ==
# Asset allocation: What is your stock/bond split?  What are your current stock and bond investments (categories such as % allocated to small cap value are fine)?  What is your desired AA?
# Goals for your bonds: The general recommendation is to view bonds as part of your overall portfolio except for specific pieces that you have invested for shorter term.  What are the goals for your bonds, and what percentage is needed when?  For instance, if you are investing for retirement but 20% of your bonds you will need to pay for a child's college education in 15 years, that is helpful information.
# Tax-advantaged space: How much of it do you have?  Do you currently have anything besides bonds in your tax-advantaged space?  Have you placed assets [[Principles_of_Tax-Efficient_Fund_Placement | efficiently?]]
# Risk tolerance: Are you comfortable with slight variations in the value of your bonds or must they lose not a single penny?

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' shows how to price only the most common types of bonds, such as a government or corporate bond without any embedded options (e.g. not callable, not an [[MBS]]). 
{{Notice|
This article builds on the basic financial principles from [[Comparing investments | ''Comparing investments'']] to show how bond prices are calculated. It does not discuss ''why'' prices change, nor should it be used to predict future performance. Please consult the forum for guidance.
}}
Microsoft Excel was used for this article. However, [https://www.libreoffice.org/discover/calc/ LibreOffice Calc] will work equally well and is a free application that is supported on several operating systems.
LibreOffice financial functions are very similar to Microsoft's functions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://help.libreoffice.org/Calc/Financial_Functions_Part_One LibreOffice Calc Financial functions]. For example PV(rate; numperiods; payment; futurevalue; type) is identical.&lt;/ref&gt;

Excel formulas are shown where possible. The figures were created from the examples. All examples are available for download at the bottom of [[:#External links | this page]].  

==Required yield==
The interest rate, or [[:Comparing Investments#Fundamental Property #1 | discount rate]], that the investor wants from investing in a bond is called the ''required yield''. Required yield is often specified as an ''annual'' interest rate. For purposes of calculating [[:Comparing Investments#Cash Flow Diagrams| cash flows]], a bond's semiannual interest rate is conventionally set to one-half the annual interest rate.

However, note that using a periodic rate as one-half the annual interest rate will result in an effective annual yield that is greater than the annual interest rate (an error in the actual interest rate).&lt;ref&gt;Fabozzi, Frank J., "Fixed Income Mathematics, Analytical &amp; Statistical Techniques", [http://www.amazon.com/Fixed-Income-Mathematics-Frank-Fabozzi/dp/0786311215?tag=bogleheads.org-20 3rd edition], page 48.&lt;br&gt; Note: The graphs on this page are not from this text (derived by the wiki author). There are no spreadsheet programs used in this book- the examples are used to verify results from Excel.&lt;br&gt;See [[:Comparing Investments#Periodic Interest Rate |Periodic Interest Rate]] in the wiki.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pricing a bond==
Bond price is the sum of the [[:Comparing Investments#Present Value| present value]] of the cash flows, which is determined by adding:&lt;ref&gt;Fabozzi, page 48.&lt;/ref&gt;
#The present value of the (semiannual) coupon payments
#The present value of the par or maturity value 

This is shown mathematically as:
:&lt;math&gt;p = \left(\frac{c}{(1+i)^1}+\frac{c}{(1+i)^2}+ ... +\frac{c}{(1+i)^N}\right) + \frac{M}{(1+i)^N}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;= c\left(\frac{1-\frac{1}{(1+i)^N}}{i}\right)+ \frac{M}{(1+i)^N}&lt;/math&gt;

:where
::p = Price
::c = Semiannual coupon payment
::i = Periodic interest rate (required yield/2)
::N = Number of periods (number of years x 2)
::M = Maturity value

As the semiannual coupon payments are equivalent to an [[:Comparing Investments#Type | ordinary annuity]], the same present value formula used for [[:Comparing Investments]] applies.

==Price / Yield curve==
The five [[:Comparing Investments#Financial variables | financial variables]] for a bond:
#'''PV''' = Bond price. A sum of the cash flows.
#'''FV''' = Par (Maturity) value. Set by the bond issuer, cannot change.
#'''PMT''' = Coupon rate. The interest rate set by the bond issuer, cannot change.
#'''N''' = Number of compounding periods, typically twice a year (semiannual). Set by the bond issuer as the Maturity date, cannot change.
#'''I''' = Required Yield, an interest rate desired by the investor. Normally specified as an &lt;u&gt;annual&lt;/u&gt; rate (Semiannual rate = Required Yield / 2).

*'''Type'''= 0. Ordinary annuity. Does not change.

Since '''I''' is in the denominator of the bond price equation, increasing '''I''' will decrease the price (the other variables are fixed). Therefore, a bond's price will always ''theoretically'' move in the opposite direction to its yield.

As yields change in the marketplace, the only variable that can compensate for these changes is ''price'' (sum of PV).&lt;ref&gt;Fabozzi, page 54.&lt;/ref&gt; This why bond charts show price and yield- they are the only 2 variables that are not set by the bond. Change one and the other follows.

Notice how the price of a bond follows the basic property of ''present value'' - as the interest rate rises, the price drops and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;[[:Comparing Investments#Fundamental Property #1 | Comparing Investments, Fundamental Property #1]], in the wiki&lt;/ref&gt; The curve of this graph has a [[:Convexity | convex]] shape, which can have significant implications for the investment properties of a bond.&lt;ref&gt;Fabozzi, page 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coupon rate, required yield, and price relationships==
As shown below, when the required yield is equal to the coupon rate, the price of the bond is equal to the par value. In this case, a 20-year, $1,000 par value, 9% coupon bond has a price of $1,000 when the required yield is 9%.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Fabozzi, page 53. Done in Excel for a 20 year, $1,000 par value, 9% coupon bond when the required yield varies from 1% to 20%.

At the time of issuance, a bond's coupon rate is set to the (approximate) prevailing yield in the market. The price of the bond is then (approximately) equal to the par value. This leads to:&lt;ref&gt;Fabozzi, page 54.&lt;/ref&gt;
*When the investor's desired interest rate (required yield, 9%) is the same as the bond's interest rate (coupon rate, 9%), the investor will pay the par value ($1,000) and vice versa.

Suppose the marketplace yields rise. The bond's coupon rate is now below the prevailing rates and is no longer competitive. Consequently, the bond's price is forced to drop below par value. This price drop represents a form of interest income to the investor as compensation for the bond's coupon rate being lower than the marketplace (required yield). A bond selling below its par value is called selling at a ''discount''. This leads to:&lt;ref&gt;Fabozzi, page 55.&lt;/ref&gt;
*If the marketplace yield increases above the coupon rate (interest rate goes above 9%), the bond price will drop below par value (below $1,000) and sell at a discount.

Alternatively, the marketplace yields drop below the coupon rate. The bond's interest rate is now higher than the market place (required yield), which makes this bond a very attractive investment. The bond's price increases as investors bid for the higher yields. A bond selling above its par value is called selling at a ''premium''. This leads to:&lt;ref&gt;Fabozzi, page 55.&lt;/ref&gt;
*If the bond's coupon rate is higher than prevailing marketplace yields (interest rate goes below 9%), the price will rise above par value (above $1,000) and sell at a premium.

Purchasing a bond at a discount or a premium can have important implications to the tax treatment of the bond's future cash flows, even in the case of tax-exempt bonds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=707461#707461 New in wiki - Bond Pricing], forum discussion&lt;/ref&gt;

==A bond's path over time==
The price of a bond is only valid at a single point in time, even if the required yield does not change. Why? The maturity date gets closer (remaining number of compounding periods decreases):
*The number of remaining coupon payments is less
*The present value of the par value changes

Even within the span of a single day, the price that must be paid to purchase a given bond changes, since the bond has accrued interest that has not yet been paid out by the coupon.  If this were not the case, then arbitrageurs could purchase bonds the day before their coupon payment and sell them the day after.  Because arbitrageurs do exactly that, the market remains efficient and sellers of bonds are compensated for accrued interest.  Note that accrued interest is often listed separately from the price of a bond.

When the required yield (marketplace interest rate) does not change:&lt;ref&gt;Fabozzi, page 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

*The price of a ''discount'' bond always ''increases'' towards par value over time.
*The price of a ''premium'' bond always ''decreases'' towards par value over time.
*If the required yield is equal to the coupon rate (marketplace interest equals bond interest), the price is ''always'' the par value.

The path of a bond over time (required yield does not change) is one of three fundamental factors that [[:#Changes in bond price | influence price]].

For example, the price over time of a 20-year, 9% coupon rate, $1,000 par value bond:

|+'''Bond Price over Time (Required Yield Does Not Change)'''
||[[File:Bond - Price over Time.png|500px|center]]
|}

Note that, while this graph shows the path through time as a smooth line, the path of a coupon-paying bond appears more sawtooth-shaped, as accrued interest builds until a coupon payment is made, then the value drops by the amount of the coupon that was disbursed (see [[:#Dirty price vs. clean price | example below]]).

==Changes in bond price==
There are three major [[:Bond Basics#Factors Affecting Bond Prices | factors which affect bond prices]]:&lt;ref&gt;Fabozzi, page 58.&lt;/ref&gt;
#Changes in required yield due to the credit quality of the issuer
#Changes in required yield due to changes in the marketplace
#The price change which occurs from simply [[:#A bond's path over time | moving over time]] (required yield is fixed)

Separating marketplace and credit quality changes from how the bond would perform with unchanging yield is important.

For example: A 20-year, 9% coupon, $1,000 bond is purchased at a price of $774.30. In 4 years, the future required yield of comparable bonds is expected to be 8%. What happens to the change in price 4 years from now?&lt;ref&gt;Fabozzi, page 58. The maturity value of $1,000 is not stated. 12% yield is used, should be 11.6% (the answers match at 12%, a difference of $22.58).&lt;/ref&gt;

::{| style="margin:1em auto 1em auto;" cellpadding= "3" border="1" style="border:1px solid gray; border-collapse: collapse;"
|align = "right"|The coupon payment per period is: 
||&lt;u&gt;$45&lt;/u&gt; = $1,000 * 9%/2

|-
|align = "right"|The 20-year bond yield at purchase is: 
||&lt;u&gt;11.6%&lt;/u&gt; = 2*45/774.30
|| (coupon payment / purchase price) * 2 payments / year
|}

In four years, the 20-year bond becomes a 16 year bond.
::{| style="margin:1em auto 1em auto;" cellpadding= "3" border="1" style="border:1px solid gray; border-collapse: collapse;"
|align = "right"|With an (expected) required yield of 8%, the bond price is: 
||&lt;u&gt;$1,089.37&lt;/u&gt; 
|| =PV(8%/2,16*2,-45,-1000)
|-
|align = "right"|Assuming the required yield has not changed (time path of bond), the bond price is: 
||&lt;u&gt;$811.32&lt;/u&gt; 
|| =PV(11.6234%/2,16*2,-45,-1000)
|}

The total price change is:
::{| style="margin:1em auto 1em auto;" cellpadding= "3" border="1" style="border:1px solid gray; border-collapse: collapse;"
||&lt;u&gt;$278.05&lt;/u&gt; = $1,089.37 - $811.32 
|| Price if the yield changes - price if the yield does not change
|}

Which is broken down as:
::{| style="margin:1em auto 1em auto;" cellpadding= "3" border="1" style="border:1px solid gray; border-collapse: collapse;"
|align = "right"|The price due to the bond's path over time (yield fixed): 
||&lt;u&gt;$37.02&lt;/u&gt; = $811.32 - $774.30 
|| Price change over 4 years, yield does not change
|-
|align = "right"|The price due to the change in required yield:  
||&lt;u&gt;$241.03&lt;/u&gt; = $278.05 - $37.02 
|| What remains, due to marketplace and credit quality
|}

==Zero coupon bonds==
[[:Zero-coupon bond | Zero coupon bonds]] do not have periodic payments. Therefore, the price of the bond is due solely to the present value of the par value.

Example: A 10-year zero coupon bond, maturity value of $1,000, and required yield of 8.6% has a price of $430.84.&lt;ref&gt;Fabozzi, page 60. Text shows $430.83 (roundoff error due).&lt;/ref&gt;

::{| style="margin:1em auto 1em auto;" cellpadding= "3" border="1" style="border:1px solid gray; border-collapse: collapse;"
|-
|align = "center"|$430.84  
|align = "center"|=PV(8.6%/2,10*2,0,-1000)
|}

The formula is used consistently with coupon bearing bonds: Required yield = (annual rate/2), a semiannual compounding period (N*2).

==Bond price quotations==
Bond prices are quoted using a percentage of par value.&lt;ref&gt;Fabozzi, page 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

*Price quotes less than 100 are selling at a discount
*Price quotes equal to 100 are selling at par value
*Price quotes greater than 100 are selling at a premium

Some securities state the quotes in terms of fractions. Just convert everything to decimal and multiply by the bond's par value to arrive at the price.

For example, a price quote of 97-7/32% for a $25,000 par value bond:

::{| style="margin:1em auto 1em auto;" cellpadding= "3" border="1" style="border:1px solid gray; border-collapse: collapse;"
|align = "right"|The decimal percentage: 
||&lt;u&gt;95.21875%&lt;/u&gt; =0.95 + 7/32/100
|| Sells at discount
|-
|align = "right"|Sells at: 
||&lt;u&gt;$23,804.69&lt;/u&gt; = 95.21875%*25000 
|| 
|}

==Price between coupon periods==
The price must be adjusted to account for bond transactions in-between coupon periods. There are 3 steps:&lt;ref&gt;Fabozzi, page 62.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Determine the number of days until the next coupon payment
*Determine the present value of the cash flow for this incremental period, a modification of the cash flow period
*Determine the accrued interest, this is ''simple interest''
::{| style="border:1px solid darkgray;"
|align="left" |Accrued Interest = c * (Number of days from last coupon payment to settlement date / Number of days in the coupon period)
|-
||where c is the coupon payment
|}

All of these steps are combined in the following example:
{{Notice|
Do not use Excel's compound interest rate financial functions, such as ''present value'' PV(), for any time other than the exact coupon date. The interest in-between coupon payments is ''simple interest'' (not compounded). Using these formulas will always result in an error. Always use the PRICE() function, which is intended for bonds.&lt;ref name="TVM"&gt;[http://www.tvmcalcs.com/calculators/apps/excel_bond_valuation Bond Valuation Using Microsoft Excel]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;PRICE() and Coupon financial functions need the Analysis Toolpak add-in for Excel 2003, but are already built-in for Excel 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
}}
For example, a corporate bond with a coupon rate of 10% maturing on March 1, 2003, was purchased with a settlement date of July 17, 1997. What is the price assuming a yield of 6.5%? What is the accrued interest?&lt;ref&gt;Fabozzi, page 67. Used to confirm results with Excel only.&lt;/ref&gt;

If the bond has a face value of $500, the price paid is $600.14.

|}

Notes on the use of PRICE():
*Coupon rates and yield are ''annual'', but coupon payments are ''semiannual'' (frequency = 2).
*Redemption is the security's redemption value per $100 face value, which is to say that it's in terms of percent par value. Multiply the result by the face value to arrive at the price.

===Dirty price vs. clean price===
The buyer must compensate the seller for the portion of interest between the settlement date and the next coupon payment. This is because the seller will then send the next payment to the buyer. This interest is called ''accrued interest''.&lt;ref&gt;Fabozzi, page 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

The price of a bond which includes the accrued interest is called the ''dirty price''. A bond priced at the settlement date (no accrued interest) is called the ''clean price''.

::{| style="border:1px solid darkgray;"
|align="left" |Dirty Price = Clean Price + Accrued Interest
|}

When the dirty price is calculated, the next coupon payment is a discounted value. However, accrued interest is not discounted. Therefore, if a bond is selling at par and the settlement date is not a coupon date, the yield will be slightly less than the coupon rate. Only when the coupon date and settlement date coincide is the yield equal to the coupon rate for a bond selling at par.&lt;ref&gt;Fabozzi, page 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

The convention is to quote a bond's clean price, but the buyer will pay the dirty price. In the above example, a buyer will be quoted $581.25, but have to pay $600.14.

As the interest accumulates in-between coupon periods, the price acquires a saw-tooth shape when the accumulated interest drops to zero at the next coupon payment. An example using a 20-year, 3% coupon, 4% required yield bond is shown below for the first 4 years of the bond.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.riskglossary.com/link/bond_accrued_interest.htm Bond Accrued Interest], example modified to show required yield at 4%. Otherwise, the price would be a straight line (price = par).&lt;/ref&gt;

Bonds have an ''ex-coupon'' (''ex-dividend'') date, which is a date in which the trade must occur in order for the buyer to receive the next coupon. If the trade occurs after that date, the accrued interest must be ''subtracted'' from the price. This is known as negative accrued interest. When the buyer receives the next coupon, the bond is said to be traded ''cum-coupon'' (''cum-dividend'').
&lt;ref&gt;Fabozzi, page 67. Also [http://www.riskglossary.com/link/bond_accrued_interest.htm Bond Accrued Interest].&lt;/ref&gt; 
::{| style="border:1px solid darkgray;"
|align="left" |Negative Accrued Interest = Coupon * (Days from the settlement date to the coupon date / Days in coupon period)
|-
|align="left" |Dirty Price = Clean Price - Negative Accrued Interest
|}

===Day count conventions===
The number of days between coupon periods vary by bond issuer. The notations have been standardized in the form of:
*Number of days in a month / actual number of days in a year

Some example conventions:&lt;ref&gt;Fabozzi, page 64. Also, Microsoft help file for PRICE().&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text bytes="11737" sha1="6s60cwwlbzshqun05iwmrtceemi9fg9" xml:space="preserve">'''{{PAGENAME}}''' shows how to calculate several common types of bond yield.
{{Notice|
This article builds on principles from [[Bond pricing]] to show how bond yields are calculated. It does not discuss why yields change, nor should it be used to predict future performance. Please consult the forum for guidance.
}}
Microsoft Excel was used for this article. However, [http://www.libreoffice.org/features/calc/ LibreOffice Calc] will work equally well and is a free application that is supported on several operating systems.
Open Office financial functions are very similar to Microsoft's functions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Documentation/How_Tos/Calc:_Financial_functions Open Office Calc Financial functions]. For example PV(rate; numperiods; payment; futurevalue; type) is identical.&lt;/ref&gt;

Excel formulas are shown where applicable. All examples are available for download at the bottom of [[#External links | this page]].

==Current yield==
The current yield formula is:

:{| style="border:1px solid darkgray;"
|align="left" |Current Yield = Annual dollar coupon interest / Price
|}

This formula does not take into account gains or losses if the bond was purchased at a discount or premium.&lt;ref&gt;Fabozzi, Frank J., "Fixed Income Mathematics, Analytical &amp; Statistical Techniques", [http://www.amazon.com/Fixed-Income-Mathematics-Frank-Fabozzi/dp/0786311215?tag=bogleheads.org-20 3rd edition], page 74.&lt;br&gt;There are no spreadsheet programs used in this book- the examples are used to verify results from Excel.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.investopedia.com/university/advancedbond/advancedbond3.asp Advanced Bond Concepts: Yield and Bond Price], on Investopedia.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example: An 18-year, $1,000 par value, 6% coupon bond selling for $700.89 has a current yield of:
:{| style="border:1px solid darkgray;"
|align="left" |8.56% = $1,000 * 6% / $700.89
|}

==Yield to maturity==
The yield to maturity is calculated using a sum of the present value of the cash flows - the same way as [[Bond pricing#Pricing a bond | pricing a bond]]. For a semiannual payment bond, this is shown mathematically as:
:{| style="border:1px solid darkgray;"
|align="left" |p = c/(1 + y)&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; + c/(1 + y)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + c/(1 + y)&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + ... + c/(1 + y)&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; + M/(1 + y)&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
|align="left" |  = c(1 - (1 + y)&lt;sup&gt;-n&lt;/sup&gt;) / y + M/(1 + y)&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;
|}

where
:p = Price
:c = Semiannual coupon payment
:y = Yield to Maturity / 2
:n = Number of periods (number of years x 2)
:M = Maturity value

Solving for y requires an iterative approach, it can't be done analytically. This is not a problem, as Excel has built-in financial formulas which solve this equation internally.&lt;ref&gt;Financial functions need the Analysis Toolpak add-in for Excel 2003, but are already built-in for Excel 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Yield to maturity considers not only the current coupon income, but any capital gain or loss realized ''by holding the bond to maturity''.

===Yield to maturity on the coupon date===
In a similar manner to [[Bond pricing#Changes in bond price | bond prices]], the RATE() function is used to calculate the yield to maturity for transactions that fall exactly on coupon dates.
Consider the [[Bonds: advanced topics#Yield to Maturity | wiki example]]: A bond has a $10,000 face value and pays $500 annually until maturity, then pays back the $10,000 principal. If the bond price drops to $9,653 four years before maturity, the yield to maturity is 6.0%:

::{| style="margin:1em auto 1em auto;" cellpadding= "3" border="1" style="border:1px solid gray; border-collapse: collapse;"
| align = "right"|Maturity: 
||$10,000.00
||
|-
| align = "right"|Coupon Rate:
|align = "right"|$500.00
||
|-
| align = "right"|Frequency:
|align = "right"|annual
||
|-
| align = "right"|Purchase Price:
|align = "right"|$9,653.00
||
|-
| align = "right"|Number of periods:
|align = "right"|4
||
|-
| align = "right"|'''Yield to Maturity:'''
|align = "right"|'''6.0%'''
||=RATE(4,500,-9653,10000,0)
|}

===Zero coupon bonds===
[[:Zero-coupon bond | Zero-coupon bonds]] have a single cash flow at maturity.

For example, a 15-year zero-coupon bond selling for $274.78 with a maturity value of $1,000 has a yield to maturity of 8.80%:&lt;ref&gt;Fabozzi, page 77.&lt;/ref&gt;

::{| style="margin:1em auto 1em auto;" cellpadding= "3" border="1" style="border:1px solid gray; border-collapse: collapse;"
| align = "right"|Maturity: 
||$1,000.00
||
|-
| align = "right"|Frequency:
|align = "right"|semiannual
||
|-
| align = "right"|Purchase Price:
|align = "right"|$274.78
||
|-
| align = "right"|Number of periods:
|align = "right"|30
||=2*15
|-
| align = "right"|'''Yield to Maturity:'''
|align = "right"|'''8.80%'''
||=RATE(2*15,0,-274.78,1000,0)*2
|}

The formula is consistent with coupon bearing bonds: Use a semiannual compounding period (N*2), the yield to maturity is an annual rate.

===Yield to maturity in-between coupon dates===
The concepts used for purchase and sales (settlement) dates in-between coupon dates are similar to [[:Bond pricing#Price between coupon periods | pricing bonds]].
*Use the [[Bond pricing#Dirty price vs. clean price | dirty (quoted)]] price
*YIELD() uses [[Bond pricing#Dirty price vs. clean price | clean price]] as an argument.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=9KA2F8BL53EC&amp;lpg=PA41&amp;dq=excel%20yield%20to%20maturity%20dirty%20price&amp;pg=PA41#v=onepage&amp;q=excel%20yield%20to%20maturity%20dirty%20price&amp;f=false Fixed Income Markets and Their Derivatives], from Google books.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Excel file at the bottom of [[:#External Links | this page]] contains an example showing how YIELD() matches the sum of the present value of cash flows, i.e. results match the dirty price by another method.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Notice|
Do not use Excel's compound interest rate financial functions, such as ''present value'' PV(), for any time other than the exact coupon date. The interest in-between coupon payments is ''simple interest'' (not compounded). Using these formulas will always result in an error. Always use the PRICE() or YIELD() functions, which are intended for bonds.&lt;ref name="TVM"&gt;[http://www.tvmcalcs.com/calculators/apps/excel_bond_valuation Bond Valuation Using Microsoft Excel]&lt;/ref&gt;
}}
For example: A corporate 10% coupon bond maturing on March 1, 2003 has a dirty price of $118.778. With a settlement date of July 17, 1997, the yield to maturity is 6.747%:&lt;ref&gt;Fabozzi, page 78.&lt;/ref&gt;

::{| style="margin:1em auto 1em auto;" cellpadding= "3" border="1" style="border:1px solid gray; border-collapse: collapse;"

|align = "right"|'''6.747%'''
||=YIELD(B11,B12,B15,B20,100,B13,B14) annual
|}

==Coupon rate, current yield, and yield to maturity relationships==
The same relationships apply for yield to maturity as for [[Bond pricing#Coupon Rate, Required Yield, and Price Relationships | pricing a bond]].&lt;ref&gt;Fabozzi, page 78.&lt;/ref&gt;

*Selling at par: Yield to Maturity equals the Coupon rate
*Selling at discount: Yield to Maturity is greater than the Coupon rate
*Selling at premium: Yield to Maturity is less than the Coupon rate

==Comparing bond yields==
Due to the varying frequencies of coupon payments and [[Bond pricing#Day count conventions | day count conventions]] (the number of days in a year), it's important to convert the yield to a common basis when comparing different bonds. These conversions are straightforward. However, combining both compounding period and day count conversions may not be obvious.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.investopedia.com/articles/bonds/08/bond-yield-convention-conversion.asp How To Compare Yields On Different Bonds], on Investopedia&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bond equivalent yield===
Similar to [[:Comparing Investments#Periodic Interest Rate | Comparing Investments]], calculation of annual yield is an exponential formula. For a semiannual payment bond:

:{| style="border:1px solid darkgray;"
|align="left" |Effective annual yield = (1 + y)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; - 1
|}
where
:y = semiannual interest rate

Instead of using the above formula, the convention is to double the semiannual yield. Calculating the yield to maturity by doubling the semiannual yield is called the ''Bond Equivalent Yield (BEY)''.&lt;ref&gt;Fabozzi, page 79.&lt;/ref&gt; For periods less than 365 days, most developed countries use simple interest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=714793#p714793 New in wiki - Bond Yield, Looking for feedback], forum discussion, direct link to post.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bey.asp Bond Equivalent Yield - BEY], on [http://www.investopedia.com/?viewed=1 Investopedia.com] shows this as a simple interest equation.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other yield comparisons====
To compare other securities, refer to [http://www.investopedia.com/articles/bonds/08/bond-yield-convention-conversion.asp How To Compare Yields On Different Bonds] for:
*T-Bills (which are sold on a discount basis), Treasury Notes and Bonds
*Securities which use a 360 days/year convention vs. 365 days/year convention
*Understanding why Bond Equivalent Yield should not be used for comparing longer maturity bonds - use Semiannual Bond Basis (SABB)
*Understanding the differences between APR (Annual Percentage Rate) and APY (Annual Percentage Yield)
*(Comparison of Bank CDs)

The index has been maintained by Bloomberg L.P. since August 24th 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title=Bloomberg Completes Acquisition of Barclays Risk Analytics and Index Solutions Business| url=https://www.bloomberg.com/company/announcements/bloomberg-acquisition-barclays-brais/| publisher=Bloomberg| date=August 24, 2016| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160831202728/https://www.bloomberg.com/company/announcements/bloomberg-acquisition-barclays-brais/| archive-date=August 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The index is a primary benchmark for US bond investors, and is a benchmark index for many US index funds. 

==Overview==
The Index is a composite of four major subindices: US Government Index; US Credit Index; US Mortgage Backed Securities Index (1986); and (beginning in 1992) US Asset Backed Securities Index. The index holds investment quality bonds. The ratings are based on S&amp;P, Moody, and Fitch bond ratings. The index does not include [[High yield bonds|high yield bonds]], [[Municipal bonds |municipal bonds]], [[Treasury Inflation Protected Securities| inflation-indexed bonds]], or [[Developed market bonds |foreign currency bonds]].

The index includes these bond asset classes:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Richard Ferri| title=All About Index Funds| page=182| isbn=0-07-148492-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Government: [[Treasury bonds |Treasury bills, notes, and bonds]], [[Government agency bonds|Agency bonds]]
*[[Corporate bonds|Credit]]: Industrial, Finance, Utility, Yankee Bonds
*[[Mortgage-backed securities|Mortgage backed]], [[GNMA]], FNMA, FHLMC
*[[Asset-backed securities|Asset backed]], Credit card receivables, Auto Loans, Home equity loans

An asset class's relative weighting within the index changes over time as new asset classes are added to the index, as the number of bonds issued rises and falls, and as market security values fluctuate.

In June 2009, as a result of the 2008 financial crisis, Barclay's announced the creation of the US Aggregate Float Adjusted Index that excludes Treasuries, agencies and MBS held in Federal Reserve accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.marketwired.com/press-release/barclays-capital-announces-the-creation-of-the-us-aggregate-float-adjusted-index-1214078.htm| title=Barclays press release| date=July 30, 2009}}{{dead link}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Index funds==
The Bloomberg US Aggregate Bond Index was formulated as a market benchmark and contains thousands of illiquid bonds. Index fund managers therefore use sampling strategies when attempting to construct index funds tracking the index. The Vanguard Bond Market ETF is a share class of the Vanguard bond market index fund. 

Selected index funds tracking the Bloomberg US Aggregate Bond Index:
* BNY Mellon Bond Market Index Fund - {{MStarFundLink|DBMIX}}
* iShares Core US Aggregate Bond ETF - {{MStarFundLink|AGG}}
* Infrastructure Capital Bond Income ETF - {{MStarFundLink|BNDS}}
* T. Rowe Price QM U.S. Bond Index Fund - {{MStarFundLink|PBDIX}}
* Nuveen Lifecycle Index Fund - {{MStarFundLink|TRILX}}

      <text bytes="33430" sha1="ppvr6cxnh715fau4pema6ureupfefs7" xml:space="preserve">The [[#Major Factors | major factors]]  in deciding between owning a bond fund versus individual bonds are: [[#Diversification | diversification]], [[#Convenience | convenience]], [[#Costs | costs]], and [[#Control over maturity | control over maturity]].  There is a common belief (promoted by Suze Orman, among others) that [[#Why Thinking of a Rolling Ladder's Return as "Safe" is Misleading | owning individual bonds is less risky]] than a bond fund, but this is not necessarily true if an appropriate bond fund or collection of funds is chosen. [[#Duration | Duration]] is an essential concept for understanding the riskiness of a fund or ladder over time.  There's also an important distinction between owning individual bonds (declining duration) and holding a rolling bond ladder. Rolling bond ladders are a constant duration investment, whereas an individual bond's duration decreases as it approaches maturity.

== Declining versus constant duration ==

=== Methods of achieving declining versus constant duration ===

What kinds of financial instruments produce a declining duration?
* An individual bond, with coupons reinvested in some form that is liquid on the bond's date of maturity (e.g. a bank account, bonds with shorter and shorter maturities as described above, or CDs with put options)
* A [[Zero-coupon bond]], which doesn't pay out a coupon so that no reinvesting of coupons is required.
* A portfolio of individual bonds, purchased with shorter and shorter maturities. A.k.a. a [[#Rolling versus Non-Rolling Bond Ladders | non-rolling bond ladder]]
* A target-date bond fund.  These are rare funds and tend to have very high expense ratios.  We will therefore not consider them further.

What kinds of financial instruments produce a constant duration?
* A portfolio of individual bonds, set up such that when one bond matures another bond of equal maturity is purchased.  A.k.a. a [[#Rolling versus Non-Rolling Bond Ladders | rolling bond ladder]].
* A bond fund, where a manager maintains the portfolio to have a fairly constant duration.

=== Reasons for choosing declining or constant duration ===

Assuming the complexities and expenses associated with each were about the same...

Why would you choose a declining duration portfolio/fund?
* You have a known expense at a future date that you want to set money aside for.  Examples include saving for a car, or for some investors, college.

Why would you choose a constant duration portfolio/fund?
* You are saving for expenses with unknown amounts and/or unknown time horizons.  Examples include retirement, saving for a house down payment, or for some investors, college.

== A framework for comparing portfolios of individual bonds to bond funds ==

* Many, if not most, Bogleheads and other investors use bonds as part of a larger portfolio because of their stabilizing properties on the whole portfolio (in this context, the proper framework for analysis is its historical long-term returns as an asset class, its risks, and its relation to the rest of the portfolio).  
* What matters is total return, not the return of any one component such as the principal which is often focused on in isolation.  Total return has three components:
** Principal
** Interest (coupon payments)
** Interest-on-interest (reinvested coupon payments)
* We will discuss what happens to the fund or bond after a single interest-rate change.  However, as long as the duration of the portfolio is kept approximately equal to the remaining time horizon, then this single interest rate change generalizes to all interest rate changes.  For instance, suppose a portfolio of bonds or funds is purchased with 5-year duration to meet a goal 5 years in the future, and is properly rebalanced to keep the duration equal to the investment horizon.  With 4 years remaining, a parallel shift of the yield curve occurs&lt;ref&gt;Refer to [[:Bonds: Advanced Topics#References | Bonds: Advanced Topics, References]] for a definition of yield curve shift&lt;/ref&gt;.  The investor would be indifferent to that interest rate change because of duration matching.  If six months later interest rates change again, the investor similarly does not care, because their duration is now 3.5 years and so they are similarly indifferent.
** This makes clear a key fact often omitted in the financial advice literature.  The recommendation to "keep your duration equal to your need for the money" cannot be applied once and forgotten, but must be updated continuously (or more realistically, by rebalancing every 3-12 months into shorter-term funds).  The only way to achieve duration matching automatically is to purchase a zero-coupon bond.  Neither individual bonds nor funds will do this perfectly, although individual bonds come closer (particularly in low-interest rate environments).  
** Note that the scenario of rebalancing bond funds or portfolios of individual bonds to meet a known, fixed, future obligation is a bit silly.  If you have such an obligation, the safest course of action is to purchase neither a fund nor an individual coupon-paying bond, but instead to purchase a zero-coupon bond maturing on the date needed.  Nevertheless, it illustrates the point that your money is safe, as will be elaborated in the rest of this page.

=== Rolling versus non-rolling bond ladders ===

If you need to satisfy date-certain future liabilities, a non-rolling ladder of individual bonds is superior to a bond fund.  For example, if you commit to make a $10,000 a year payment to a charity for five years, the most effective way to invest for that is to buy 5 zero-coupon bonds, one maturing each year.  A non-rolling bond ladder matches cash flows to liabilities, which immunizes a portfolio against interest rate shifts.

However, most bond ladders are "rolling", because they are not designed to deal with date-certain future liabilities.  They are created with a specific average duration, and when the oldest bond comes due, a new long-dated bond is purchased to replace it.  A rolling ladder of this kind can and should be directly compared with a bond fund using the [[#Major Factors | criteria]] below.  According to Vanguard in their [[Individual_Bonds_vs_a_Bond_Fund#Links | paper]] ''Taxable bond investing: Bond funds or individual bonds?'', "The total return of a laddered account with characteristics identical to those of an open-end bond fund will deviate from the fund’s return only by the transaction and operational cost differentials."

As advocated by [[Zvi Bodie]], some people aim to fund their retirement by purchasing a ladder of individual TIPS with durations of 1 to 30 years.  The idea is to avoid the volatility of the underlying bonds by always holding them to maturity, so as to avoid having to sell the fund at moments when high yields have caused the NAV to drop.

If you are planning to reinvest (i.e, rollover) some of the annual redemption into new individual TIPS bonds, then you have gained nothing by using a rolling ladder over a fund. Because not rolling over the whole bond at the (hypothetically) very high yield has an identical opportunity cost to selling a portion of your fund at the (hypothetically) very low NAV. Another issue with this approach is how to deal with the longevity risk if you outlive your ladder.

Thus, the distinction between a non-rolling ladder (designed to meet date-certain future liabilities) and a rolling ladder (which essentially represents a personal bond fund) is much more important than the difference between a rolling ladder and a bond fund.

== Rolling ladders and funds are similar ==

It has been regularly argued on the [http://www.bogleheads.org Bogleheads forum] that a bond fund is risky because of [[NAV]] fluctuations. For example, the [[NAV]] for [{{Vf | 0119}} Vanguard Inflation Protected Securities] fell 20.4% from peak to trough in 2008.  Instead, it is said, investors should hold individual bonds, which can always be redeemed at face value by holding until maturity. However, the value of individual bonds held in a personal portfolio fluctuates just as the NAV of a bond fund fluctuates. You can see this by looking at the daily price changes of individual bonds online at [http://fixedincome.fidelity.com/fi/FISearchIndividualBonds Fidelity's fixed income site]. Bond prices can also be obtained online through [https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/bonds/bonddesk Vanguard's Bond Desk]. The daily fluctuation of the price of an individual bond will be similar to a bond fund ''if their duration is the same''.

== Non-rolling ladders versus funds ==

A non-rolling ladder (or a single bond) will behave differently than a bond fund over time. This is because a bond fund (usually) maintains a relatively constant duration. On the other hand, a non-rolling ladder has a duration that decreases over time. If you want to obtain the behavior of a non-rolling ladder using bond funds you must decrease the duration of the bond fund over time. This is done by mixing two funds so that their weighted average duration is the same as the ladder which you are trying to mimic. In some cases it may not be possible to find a fund with the duration that you want. For example, Vanguard only offers one TIPS fund so you will need to buy individual TIPS to achieve the duration that you are looking for.

== Duration ==

It's useful to focus on the [[:Bonds: Advanced Topics#Duration | duration]] of your bond fund, such as the Vanguard TIPS Fund, which currently has a duration of [{{Vf | 0119}} 5.0 years].  [[William Bernstein]] provides an insightful [http://www.efficientfrontier.com/ef/999/duration.htm definition of duration] as the "point of indifference" for the owner of a bond fund in dealing with interest rate changes.  If interest rates rise after purchasing a bond fund, the NAV of the fund falls, which hurts the investor.  However, the dividends that the bond fund throws off can now be reinvested at a higher rate.  The duration is the length of time that an investor needs to hold the fund for the increased yields to compensate for the decrease in NAV.  In that sense, duration represents the length of time it would take for the total value of the fund, with dividends reinvested, to be worth exactly what it would have been worth had interest rates not risen.  So, you should always hold bond funds with a duration equal to or shorter than the expected need for your money (note that holding the duration shorter than your need for the money leaves you exposed to the risk of lower returns if interest rates fall).

Of course, as discussed above, this definition of duration applies equally to bond funds and to an individual portfolio of bonds.  The relationship does not exactly hold if the [[Bonds:_Advanced_Topics#Yield_Curves | yield curve]] shifts in a non-parallel fashion, but the difference is expected to be small.

Interest rates change continuously, not just at a single point in time.  Therefore, as the time when you will need the money approaches, you must reduce your duration accordingly, to protect you against any further increases in prevailing rates.  The ways in which this can be done are discussed below.

=== Why thinking of a rolling ladder's return as "safe" is misleading ===

The common argument for individual bonds over a fund is that at maturity you are guaranteed to get your principal back.  While this is true, the principal is only one of the three sources of return for a bond:
# Principal
# Interest (coupon payments)
# Interest-on-interest (reinvested coupon payments)

According to [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_J._Fabozzi Fabozzi] in the ''Handbook of Fixed Income Securities'', 1991, p97:
"In high interest rate environments, the interest-on-interest component for long-term bonds may be as high as 70 percent of the bond's potential total dollar return."

Therefore, focusing on the principal as "safe" misses the point, since it is in many circumstances the smallest component of a bond's return.  If you are saving for a large goal, you therefore have to invest considerably more into the bond than you want guaranteed to ensure the need is met by the principal. 

To make sure the total value (all three components listed above) winds up being what you expected it to be, you should maintain a portfolio duration equal to your investment horizon and continually reduce the duration as your investment horizon nears (or more realistically, rebalance every 3-12 months, which Michael Granito in ''Bond Portfolio Immunization'' claims didn't cause any substantial deviations from target return vs. continuous rebalancing in a variety of simulated market conditions).  A zero-coupon bond does this automatically.  A coupon-paying bond does not (duration declines very slowly at first and then more rapidly once the bond nears its maturity; this is more pronounced in high-rate environments and less important in low-rate periods), nor does a bond fund (duration is relatively constant).   Stated differently, since the duration of a coupon-paying bond is less than its maturity, if you invest such that the bond matures when you need the money, you are by definition not investing such that the duration is equal to your investment horizon, leaving you vulnerable to interest rate declines.

In another text (''Fixed Income Mathematics'', 1993, p175), Fabozzi summarizes, "Therefore, investing in a coupon bond with a yield to maturity equal to the target yield and a maturity equal to the investment horizon does not assure that the target accumulated value will be achieved."

=== Zero-coupon example ===

If you have a sudden need to extract the principal from a bond fund (or portfolio of individually-held bonds, for that matter), you can do so as rapidly as possible by selling the fund and buying a [[zero-coupon bond]] with the face value of your principal. Such a bond will always be available, because if the fund's NAV is down, yields will have gone up a commensurate amount.  On average (with a typical yield curve), the bond will have a maturity equal to the duration of the TIPS fund.  (A regular TIPS bond would also serve the same purpose, but a zero coupon bond makes the calculation simpler, because the duration equals the maturity.)

The strategy of buying a zero-coupon bond works because the duration of a zero equals the maturity, and therefore declines steadily as time passes.  No other commonly-available type of bond instrument has this property (although it can be replicated with bond funds or with individual bonds, provided you rebalance regularly).  Therefore, if you have a fixed, known obligation at some future point in time, a zero-coupon bond is the obvious choice to satisfy it.

''For example:'' Fred buys a bond fund while Larry buys bond ladder, each with equal duration. Interest rates skyrocket just afterward. At that moment, Fred and Larry have an equal loss. Fred can log into Vanguard and see that his fund balance is, say, 70% of what he invested. Larry can log into Vanguard Brokerage Services and see that the total value of all of the bonds in his ladder are 70% of what he invested. Whether either decides to realize the loss or not, the loss has in fact occurred.

Now, the only difference between Fred and Larry is that Larry has two options for getting his money back and Fred has one.  Fred can sell his bond fund and buy a [[Zero-coupon bond|zero coupon bond]] with a maturity value equal to his initial capital investment.  Larry can likewise sell his bond ladder and buy a zero coupon bond.  Larry's additional option is to hold all of his bonds until maturity. However, this second option is unambiguously worse for Larry. He would need to hold his longest bonds twice as long as the zero coupon bond to get his money back. Due to the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost opportunity cost] of having his money unnecessarily locked up, this means he would actually be losing money versus the zero coupon option. In addition, for taxable accounts, selling their holdings to buy zero coupon bonds would let Larry and Fred take advantage of [[tax loss harvesting]].

Please note that this whole example is artificial, because it is extremely rare for a bond holder to decide that he needs to immediately liquidate all of his principal.  Instead, bond holders are generally interested in steady growth over the long term.  Some people suffered 15 or 20% losses in their bond holdings (both fund and ladders) in late 2008.  Very few sold their holdings to buy zero coupon bonds.  Instead, they continued making periodic contributions like they always do, ignoring the balance of the fund.  And this was certainly the right choice, as the funds have regained their previous value.

The whole argument for individual bonds being less risky is based on this completely artificial concept that you will one day decide you need all of your money back, and then happily wait 20 years to get it back (all in nominal terms, meaning the money has been eaten away by inflation in the meantime).  The point of using zero coupon bonds is that they are an equally arbitrary option.  But they show that Fred is never worse off than Larry: a bond fund is no riskier than a bond ladder.

In real life, people should hold bond funds (high grade, short or intermediate term, and a mix of nominal and inflation-adjusted), and just ignore the NAV.  All that matters is total return, and if you hold the fund longer than the duration, your total return will be just fine.  The zero coupon example is just an academic way of making that point.

== Convexity ==

Positive convexity, a characteristic possessed by bonds without options, is ignored in the above discussion but only strengthens the argument, since positive convexity lengthens duration when rates fall and shortens duration when rates rise.  The [[Bonds:_Advanced_Topics#Convexity|Advanced Bonds section]] contains more detail.

== Yield curve changes ==

Changes in the shape of the [[Bonds:_Advanced_Topics#Yield_Curves|yield curve]] may make a difference in the above comparison, but the effect is expected to be minor for a long term investment.

== Major factors ==

=== Diversification ===

Diversification is important for bonds, as it is for all asset classes. The argument against an investor ever owning individual [[Corporate bonds |corporate]] or [[Municipal Bonds |municipal bonds]] (even in a ladder) is that the effect of a single default (such as a corporation or city brought down by fraud), even if unlikely, could be devastating to the investor's portfolio. By contrast, bond funds allow extremely broad diversification at a very low cost.

A ladder of individual bonds generally includes between 10 and a couple dozen bonds.  That means that each bond represents 2.5% to 10% of a portfolio.  By contrast [{{Vf | 0084}} Total Bond] owns [{{Vf | 0084}} 3855 different bonds], and [{{Vf | 0042}} Intermediate Term Tax Exempt] owns [{{Vf | 0042}} 1971].  So, the failure (default) of any one bond has a minuscule effect on the fund.

The only exceptions are Treasury bonds (including [[TIPS]]). Because all Treasury bonds are explicitly backed by the US government, they have the highest possible credit rating. They also all have the same issuer. There is no diversification benefit from owning a Treasury bond fund instead of individual Treasury bonds.

=== Convenience ===

Investors in a bond fund can buy or sell additional shares at any time in any quantity. There is usually no transaction fee for buying or selling additional shares. With individual bonds, purchases on the primary market may only be made on the pre-set issuer schedule (e.g., every few months for TIPS). Purchases on the secondary market are generally subject to a commission and one always pays a [[bid/ask spread]], which can be substantial.  Also, individual bond purchases are only available in increments of $1,000 (and more often $5,000 or $10,000).

Bond funds offer automatic dividend reinvestment.  While you are in your accumulation phase, it is far more convenient to have dividends automatically reinvested.  Even after beginning to spend your holdings, it is generally simpler to have bond funds automatically reinvest dividends and then just sell a fixed amount of the fund monthly or quarterly.  By contrast, there is no simple way to reinvest small amounts into individual bonds.  It is also far more convenient to [[Rebalancing |rebalance]] between a bond fund and other assets in your portfolio.

Taxes are simpler for bond funds.  If you invest in a bond fund in a taxable account, you receive tax forms from the bond fund company. If you have a portfolio of individual bonds, you receive tax forms from TreasuryDirect or your brokerage account listing the tax-related items for each bond. It's easier to figure out the tax reporting for one bond fund versus many individual bonds.  Also, owners of individual TIPS owe a tax on [[TIPS#Tax_Considerations | phantom income]] that they do not receive.  This is not an issue with TIPS funds.

On the other hand, for investors who are accustomed to managing a portfolio of individual bonds, a rolling bond ladder can be fairly simple to manage and can be simpler to understand conceptually.  This is made somewhat more complicated when individual issues are discontinued, leaving a hole in the bond ladder.  For instance, there were no 20-year Treasuries issued from 1986-1993.  The solution is either to find equivalent combinations of bonds which keep the overall duration the same (in a 6% interest rate environment, to replace the 20-year you could use 36% 10-year and 64% 30-year bonds), or to buy a longer issue from which some time has elapsed on the secondary market (e.g. buy a 30-year bond issued 10 years ago) and bear the cost of the poor spread individuals receive when buying bonds in small lots.

=== Costs ===

The costs associated with owning bonds are commissions, [[bid/ask spread]]s, and management fees.  Primary purchases of bonds (such as at a TIPS auction) generally do not incur commissions or bid/ask spreads.  Purchases and sales on a secondary market can have substantial commissions and bid/ask spreads, particularly on less liquid bonds like [http://moneywatch.bnet.com/investing/blog/irrational-investor/municipal-bonds-and-the-industrys-dirty-little-secret/1621/ municipals] and corporates.  Spreads also tend to be wider for the smaller value transactions that individual investors make&lt;ref&gt;"The bid side will widen as the trade size gets
smaller (unlike that for stocks)." [http://moneywatch.bnet.com/investing/blog/wise-investing/the-truth-about-municipal-bond-costs/1502/?tag=col1;blog-river -Larry Swedroe]&lt;/ref&gt;.  With the exception of primary purchases of Treasury bonds and TIPS, bond funds pay much lower bid/ask spreads on their bond transactions, giving them a significant cost advantage over regular investors purchasing individual bonds.  Even for Treasuries bought at auction, the cost discrepancy is not clear-cut; off-the-run Treasuries generally pay higher yields than new issues of the same effective maturity, mitigating much of the advantage of buying new issues with no spread.  Swedroe points out (see [http://moneywatch.bnet.com/investing/blog/wise-investing/ginnie-maes-effect-on-portfolios/1229/#comments comment 20]) that the same phenomenon exists in the municipal bond market as well.

There is no management fee for holding a portfolio of individual bonds.  However, there is an opportunity cost associated with the time to do so.  If you enjoy purchasing TIPS in auction, than this time is really a consumption item rather than an expense.  If tracking auction dates and the shape of the yield curve doesn't seem like fun, than it should be treated as a real cost.  For example, holding $100,000 of VAIPX (Vanguard [{{Vf | 5119}} Inflation-Protected Securities Fund Admiral]) costs $110 per year (with an expense ratio of 0.11%).  If you value your time at $55 an hour, it is more cost effective to use this fund than hold your own portfolio of bonds if it takes you more than 2 hours a year to manage your portfolio.

=== Control over maturity and other bond characteristics ===

==== Control over maturity ====

By managing your own portfolio of bonds, you can either pick the average duration you want or "ride" the [[Bonds: Advanced Topics#Yield Curves | yield curve]] to pick up bonds that are "cheap" compared to the [[Laddering Bonds or CDs | ladder]] overall, and allow your [[Bonds: Advanced Topics#Duration|duration]] to fluctuate with your purchases.  In either case, you are in control.  With a bond fund, the duration is designed not to move more than a year or two and is managed by the fund.

However, investors need to consider who is in the best position to find bonds that are slightly under-priced, you or a dozen expert bond analysts at a fund company whose only job it is to follow the bond market? 

Also, if you'd like a shorter duration than offered by a bond fund, it is easy to shorten it by putting a portion of the money in a [[Money Markets | money market fund]].  For example, the Vanguard municipal bond fund for New York has an average maturity of [{{Vf | 0076}} 11.1 years].  You can approximately halve that by holding half of your money in that fund and half in the [{{Vf | 0163}} New York Tax Exempt Money Market].  Depending on the shape of the yield curve (concave vs. convex), this may cost you return. 

==== Control over convexity ====

While it is relatively easy to calculate the [[Bonds:_Advanced_Topics#Convexity | convexity]] of a portfolio of individual bonds, most bond funds ([http://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=655486&amp;sid=714d3b8675acf919898c29db3a8d4fe9 including Vanguard]) do not make the convexity of their funds available.  This opens the door for manager risk (where unscrupulous managers can "juice" their yield by buying bonds with lower convexity--investors will never know until it is too late).  However, while investors in a portfolio of individual bonds can calculate the convexity, few do, in part because taking advantage of this generally requires purchasing on the secondary market, which is expensive for small portfolios.  Therefore the real-world application of this difference may be limited.

==== Control over inflation factor ====

There is an additional factor to consider for [[Treasury_Inflation_Protected_Securities|TIPS]], in that buying individual issues gives you control over the "inflation factor" (also known as the "index ratio").  This allows you to manage deflation risk (generally at some premium which reflects the market's expectation of deflation).

==== Control over tax-efficient characteristics ====

Some managers may choose to purchase AMT bonds to increase yield, which disadvantages investors subject to this tax.  This is easily avoided by researching the fund's holdings.

==== Control over call risk ====

Managers may also choose to purchase bonds with higher call risk to boost the fund's yield, which disadvantages investors if the risk shows up at the wrong time or if they are not planning for this risk in their overall portfolio.  Careful research into long-term track records and holdings of funds will mitigate this problem.

==== Control over liquidity ====

Bond funds have to meet redemptions at any time.  They may handle this in at least two ways: by holding cash reserves or by investing in more liquid bonds (e.g. on-the-run Treasuries vs. off-the-run Treasuries).  Both approaches earn lower yields on the proportion of the fund held as liquidity reserves.

==== Availability of other fixed income types ====

CDs are not available in a bond fund. Often, CDs yield more than the equivalently risk-free Treasury of similar duration.

=== Manager risk and opacity === 

Bond funds should be selected carefully.  The experience of Schwab YieldPlus Investor [http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=swypx&amp;d=t (SWYPX)] demonstrates this risk--an UltraShort bond fund that was billed as a safe alternative to money market funds lost over 50% of its NAV.  Read the prospectus carefully for indications such as the use of complicated derivatives (options, futures, options on futures, swaps), leverage, short sales, junk bonds, foreign and emerging market bonds, convertible securities, mortgage dollar rolls, etc.  YieldPlus used all of these.  While it is possible to use these tools to reduce risk, it is also possible to greatly magnify the risk in exchange for only small gains in yield.  The rise of bond index funds holds the possibility of eliminating manager risk entirely, leaving only the much smaller risk of tracking error.

=== Tax-loss harvesting ===

Larry Swedroe [http://moneywatch.bnet.com/investing/blog/irrational-investor/bonds-or-bond-funds-an-easy-choice/873/?tag=col1;blog-river makes the interesting point] that holding a portfolio of individual bonds lets you [[Tax_loss_harvesting | tax-loss harvest]] at the single-bond level; with a fund you can only TLH when a whole fund incurs a loss.  The magnitude of this benefit is unclear and will depend on the investor's tax bracket.  Since bid-ask spreads tend to be large on the secondary market (particularly for non-Treasuries), this strategy is not viable for most individual investors.  Moreover, since Boglehead strategy is to [[Principles_of_Tax-Efficient_Fund_Placement | place bonds in tax-advantaged spaces whenever possible]], the ability to TLH is likely quite limited for most smaller investors (as he himself points out, "For typical smaller investor bond funds are the ONLY way to go.").  For larger portfolios involving Treasuries in taxable accounts, Mr. Swedroe's insight may tip the balance in favor of holding individual bonds.

== When to hold a rolling ladder or fund ==

As explained earlier, the value of a rolling bond ladder reacts the same to market changes as the NAV of a bond fund if their holdings are the same so daily price fluctuations should not be a consideration. However, there are other factors to consider when choosing between a bond fund and a rolling ladder of individual issues, as detailed below.  The principal tradeoff for a long-term investor is the diversification of bond funds and the low trading costs vs. the expense ratio of the fund.

For bond categories with high credit risk such as [[Corporate bonds|corporate bonds]], [[High yield bonds|high yield bonds]], or [[Emerging market bonds| emerging market bonds]], bond funds are the clear choice because the diversification benefit clearly exceeds the expense ratio.  For [[Municipal bonds|municipal bonds]] the picture is less clear, as default rates are quite low; nevertheless for small-to-medium-sized portfolios ([http://moneywatch.bnet.com/investing/blog/irrational-investor/bonds-or-bond-funds-an-easy-choice/873/?tag=col1;blog-river Swedroe suggests $500k minimum portfolio size whereas Alan Roth suggests $50m]) the diversification benefit still argues for a fund, as does the liquidity premium (bid/ask spreads are quite high for munis).

For [[Treasury bonds| treasury bonds]] (including [[Treasury_Inflation_Protected_Securities | TIPS]]), which are assumed to lack any credit risk, the diversification of a fund adds little benefit over a rolling bond ladder.  Therefore the expense ratio is merely a convenience fee (or perhaps a small liquidity premium).  For a low-cost Treasury fund, however, that fee may be reasonable and is a matter of personal preference.  If you are not interested in the greater liquidity and lower demands on investor time of a fund, the best way of investing in Treasuries is to purchase individual bonds at auction (which is generally free), assuming the spread over equivalent off-the-run issues is not too large.  This is particularly true if the investor is considering [[CDs_vs_Bonds | CDs as a substitute for treasuries]], as they often yield more and are unavailable in fund form.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' are debentures issued by a Federal Agency or a government-sponsored enterprise (GSE).{{#tag:ref| FINRA defines a Government-Sponsored Enterprise (GSE) as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.finra.org/investors/investing/investment-products/bonds#key-terms| title=Bonds - Key terms | publisher=FINRA.org| accessdate=October 2, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{blockquote|A GSE is an enterprise that's chartered by Congress to fulfill a public purpose but is privately owned and operated, such as the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac). Unlike bonds guaranteed by a government agency such as the Government National Mortgage Association (Ginnie Mae), those issued by a GSE are not backed by the "full faith and credit" of the U.S. government.}}|group="note"}} Bonds issued by a Federal Agency are usually backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government. Agency debentures issued by a GSE are backed only by that GSE's ability to pay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/agency_debenture.asp| title=Agency Debenture: What It Means, How it Works| publisher=Investopedia| accessdate=October 2, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt; Government agency bonds ([[Mortgage-backed security |mortgage backed securities]] excluded) are tracked by the Bloomberg US Agency Index. US government mortgage backed securities are tracked by the Bloomberg MBS Index.

==Agency bonds issued by federal government agencies==

Federal agencies issuing bonds include:

* Federal Housing Administration
* [[Government National Mortgage Association|GNMA]] (Ginnie Mae)
* Small Business Administration

These bonds are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government to pay interest and pay back principal at maturity. Some agency issues may be callable and subject to call risk. Agency issues are less liquid than treasury bonds and usually pay a slightly higher interest rate as compensation. Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) bonds are not backed by a government full faith and credit guarantee but rather by the power revenue generated by the Authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://tva.q4ir.com/investment-opportunities/default.aspx| title=TVA - Investment Opportunities| publisher=Tennessee Valley Authority| accessdate=October 2, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Other agencies of the Federal Government issue bonds through the Federal Financing Bank (created in 1973 to lower borrowing costs for smaller governmental agencies).

==Bonds issued by Government Sponsored Enterprise (GSEs)== 

GSEs issuing bonds include:

* Farm Credit Banks
* Farm Credit System Financial Assistance Corporation
* Federal Home Loan Banks
* [[Fannie Mae |Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae)]]
* [[Freddie Mac |Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac)]]
* Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation (Farmer Mac)
* Student Loan Marketing Association (Sallie Mae)

GSEs are not backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. These bonds are subject to both credit risk and default risk and the yield on these bonds is typically slightly higher than on U.S. Treasury bonds.

On September 6, 2008, both Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae were placed into conservatorship by the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), essentially confirming the market's longstanding assumption that the GSEs' debt securities would be backed by the U.S. Government in case of crisis.

==Bond structures==
{{Quote
|quote = '''&lt;u&gt;Agency Bonds Snapshot&lt;/u&gt;'''
*'''Issuer''': Government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs)
*'''Minimum Investment''': Varies—generally $10,000
*'''Interest Payment''': Fixed coupon or floating/variable coupon rates. Interest is paid semiannually for fixed-coupon security.
*'''How to Buy/Sell''': Through a broker
*'''Bond Interest Rate''': Determined at origination and varies by bond
*'''Price Information''': Issue price and secondary trade data available through a broker and data vendors

'''&lt;u&gt;Agency Risk Report Card&lt;/u&gt;'''
*'''Credit and default risk''' are real for GSE-issued agencies: The federal government is under no legal obligation to save a GSE from default.
*'''Call risk''': Many agency securities—step-ups in particular—carry call provisions that allow the issuer to pay you prior to the bond's maturity date, typically when interest rates drop, leaving you to reinvest at lower prevailing rates.
*'''Interest rate risk''': If interest rates rise, the value of an agency bond on the secondary market will likely fall. 

'''&lt;u&gt;Mortgage backed securities Risk Report Card&lt;/u&gt;'''
*'''Credit and default risk''' are real for MBSs issued by GSEs: The federal government is under no legal obligation to save a GSE from default.
*'''Prepayment risk''' that acts much like call risk: You get your principal back sooner than the stated maturity, but the reinvestment opportunities are limited due to the inconsistent prepayment rates, which are driven by real estate mortgage interest rates and refinancing trends; population, geographic mobility and employment opportunities; and social and economic factors that are difficult to model.
*'''Extension risk''': The opposite of prepayment risk—the risk that interest rates will go up, lengthening the estimated maturity (but not the stated maturity) of your MBS and creating more holding-period risk.
*'''Interest rate risk''': If interest rates rise, the value of a mortgage-backed security on the secondary market will likely fall.

}}

Agency and GSEs issue debt securities with different structures. These structures include:

*'''Fixed coupon''': Most agency debt issues are fixed rate, non-callable bonds. GNMA securities are (full faith and credit) [[Mortgage-backed security | mortgage pass-through securities]]. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac also issue mortgage pass through securities (not full faith and credit) in addition to bond issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://capitalmarkets.fanniemae.com/debt-securities| title=Fannie Mae Debt Securities | publisher=Fannie Mae| accessdate=October 2, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://capitalmarkets.freddiemac.com/debt| title=Debt Securities - Capital Markets| publisher=Freddie Mac| accessdate=October 2, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Variable or floating coupon rate''': These bonds have floating rates that change periodically. The interest rate is linked by formula to a treasury bond or [[wikipedia:SOFR|SOFR]] index.
*'''No coupon''': Very short term agency debt is issued at a discount and matures at par value. These securities are similar in structure to Treasury bills.
*'''Callable''': Agencies issue callable bonds with what is known as "step up" coupon rates. Callable agency bonds have a preset coupon rate "step up" option that provides for increases in interest rates or the coupon rate as the bonds approach maturity. This feature is designed to minimize the interest rate risk for investors over time. However, step up bonds are often called by issuers during periods of declining interest rates. A called bond returns an investor's principal sooner than expected and usually forces the investor to reinvest principal at a lower rate of interest.
*'''Mortgage backed securities''': Mortgage-backed securities (MBS) are pools of first mortgages on residential properties. As the underlying loans are paid off by homeowners, the investors in MBS receive payments of interest and principal over time.

==Taxation==
GNMA bonds, and all bonds from GSEs are subject to federal tax, and to state and local income tax in most states. Most other agency bonds are subject to federal income taxation but are exempt from state and local income tax.

==Role in a portfolio==
These bonds are as safe (when backed by the full faith and credit of the Government) or almost as safe (GSEs) as Treasury bonds, in terms of risk of default. However, they often have additional options embedded within them, which add risk to the purchaser. 

In particular, [[GNMA]]s have significant [[Bonds: advanced topics#Convexity |negative convexity]] resulting from the underlying mortgage holder's ability to reduce repayments when rates rise or refinance when rates fall. Since these markets are reasonably efficient, bondholders are compensated by some amount for bearing these risks. However, since risks may come into play at precisely the wrong time, some portfolio theorists advise care when designing a portfolio using mortgage backed securities. This is a controversial topic among many Bogleheads. However, most agree that choosing to include bonds with significant optionality in your portfolio is less important than choosing your overall stock/bond split in a way that reduces risk to a comfortable level. 

A reasonable summary of the controversy might be the following conclusion:
Inclusion of such bonds by purchasing Total Bond Market or a similar fund is unlikely to hugely affect portfolio performance (see the arguments of [[Taylor Larimore]] on the forum),&lt;ref&gt;{{forum link| t=70979| title=Have GNMAs hurt or helped Total Bond Market ?}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas allowing bonds with significant optionality to form a much larger portion of the bond component of your portfolio would likely be unwise. Deciding to not include any such bonds in your portfolio can also be a wise choice (see the arguments of [[Larry Swedroe]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/why-gnmas-shouldnt-be-your-bond-choice/| title=Why GNMAs Shouldn't Be Your Bond Choice| publisher=CBS News| accessdate=October 2, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The global bond market is commonly divided into '''developed market bonds''' and emerging market bonds (see Figure 1, Global Bond Market, for the country distribution by market value of developed market bonds in the Barclay's Capital Global Aggregate Bond Index). In many instances, countries issue both nominal and inflation indexed debt securities.

Sovereign debt (issued by governments) is the prevalent asset comprising the international debt markets. Approximately 20% of market index composition is corporate debt as foreign companies primarily use banks, not capital markets, for debt funding.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Joseph H. Ph.D., Patterson, Andrew J.; Philips, Christopher B. CFA, and Thomas, Charles J., [https://institutional.vanguard.com/iam/pdf/ICRIFI.pdf Global fixed income: Considerations for U.S. investors], Vanguard Research and Commentary, January 2011 p.12 &lt;/ref&gt; A key investment decision regarding international bonds is whether or not to hedge currency risk.

==Risk and return==
Like bonds issued in the U.S., international bonds pay interest according to set schedules and return principal at maturity. In addition to [[Bond basics#Risks |risks]] common to all bonds, international bonds bear currency risk unless this risk is hedged and political risk (for example, wars, revolution, sovereign debt defaults).&lt;ref&gt;For an examination of historical sovereign default risk see [http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/chapters/0262195534chapm1.pdf Sovereign Defaults and Debt Restructurings:Historical Overview], Chapter 1, pp. 1-26. Recent default experience is examined in a Vanguard white paper [http://www.vanguard.com/pdf/icrwne.pdf?linkLocation=insights_overview What’s Next for the Eurozone?]&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Correlation==
Developed market bond returns do not correlate precisely with U.S stock and bond markets. A Vanguard Institutional white paper,'' Global fixed income: Considerations for U.S. investors'' finds that, for the period 1990-2010, the correlations between U.S and international bonds for changes in long term bond yields and for changes in inflation, the two main drivers of bond returns, are low and varied. The correlation coefficients for changes in long term interest rates range from +.20 to +.65. The correlation coefficients for changes in inflation range from +.10 to +.50.&lt;ref&gt; The international markets included in the analysis are Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Spain, and the U. K.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pros and cons of international bond investing==
In this section, we draw heavily on a 2011 paper entitled [https://personal.vanguard.com/pdf/icrifi_032012_high.pdf Global fixed income: Considerations for U.S. investors], in which Vanguard authors Christopher B. Philips et al. make a measured case for currency-hedged international bond funds. In this paper, they state: {{blockquote|"To make the strategic decision to include international bonds in a diversified portfolio, an investor should weigh the trade-offs among several factors" which they list as

* the potential to reduce portfolio volatility, 
* exposure to the largest global asset class, 
* the costs of implementation, 
* the investor’s own views on the future path of the U.S. dollar.}}

It is crucial to distinguish between hedged and unhedged foreign bond mutual funds, and to know which kind you are buying. Unfortunately, actively managed funds tend to leave the managers free to perform whatever tactical hedging maneuvers they think best, so these funds often do not clearly characterize themselves as one or the other. In these funds, the managers attempt to exploit currency risk by making advantageous use of currency movements.

A hedged fund reduces currency risk by buying forward currency futures contracts. Such a fund promises to give investors the benefit of reduced portfolio volatility by global diversification across different bond markets, and exposure to the largest global asset class. However, hedging increases implementation cost. And it reduces risk both ways; an investor who predicts future weakening of the dollar might hope to benefit from currency risk.

===Arguments for holding only domestic bonds===
David Swensen, the investment manager of the Yale Endowment Fund, in his book, ''Unconventional Success: A Fundamental Approach to Personal Investment,'' advises U.S. domiciled investors to avoid foreign bonds funds in their portfolios and stick with treasury bonds and treasury inflation indexed securities (TIPs). Swenson argues that, for U.S. investors, treasury bonds offer protection against financial crisis and deflation, and treasury inflation protected securities provide protection against inflation. In the case of foreign bonds, foreign currencies provide no expected return and unhedged bonds do not offer investors the same protection against financial crisis and deflation as do treasury bonds. In addition, foreign bonds held by a majority foreign clientele introduce political risk to the security (the foreign government's interests might not be aligned with a non-citizen investor's interests in crisis situations). In summary, Swensen states his position:

{{blockquote|Foreign-currency-denominated bonds share domestic bond's burden of low expected returns without the benefit of domestic fixed income's special diversifying power. Fully hedged foreign bonds mimic U.S. bonds (with the disadvantage of added complexity and costs stemming from the hedging process). Unhedged foreign bonds supply investors with U.S. dollar bond exposure, plus (perhaps unwanted) foreign exchange exposure. Foreign-currency-denominated bonds play no role in well constructed investment portfolios.&lt;ref&gt;David Swenson, [http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0743228383?tag=bogleheadswiki-20 Unconventional Success: A Fundamental Approach to Personal Investment], pp. 122-124.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Author [[Rick Ferri]] posits three tests for including an asset class in a portfolio:
#Does an asset class provide exposure to a unique investment risk?
#Does the asset class provide a real return (higher than the inflation rate)?
#Is the asset class available in a broadly diversified, liquid, low-cost fund?

Ferri judges international bond funds as passing the first two requirements, but prior to 2013 as failing on the cost issue with expenses not being 0.20% or lower. In May of 2013, Vanguard released their Total International Bond Index fund. That fund's Admiral and ETF share-classes both have expense ratios of 0.20%, passing Ferri's third requirement and now apparently would merit consideration for strategic asset allocation in portfolios.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forbes.com/sites/rickferri/2011/05/26/why-i-dont-buy-foreign-bond-funds/ Why I Don't Buy Foreign Bond Funds], Forbes 5/26/2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arguments for holding hedged international bond funds===
In [https://institutional.vanguard.com/iam/pdf/ICRIFI.pdf?cbdForceDomain=true Global fixed income: Considerations for U.S. investors], Philips et. al. state in their summary that "For the average investor seeking to minimize volatility in a diversified portfolio, we find that allocating from 20% to 40% of the fixed income portion to international bonds can provide a reasonable balance between diversification and cost, assuming that the currency risk inherent to this asset class is hedged."

In ''The Only Guide You'll Ever Need for the Right Financial Plan,'' p. 51, Larry Swedroe et. al. state that "Unhedged foreign-currency exposure for fixed-income investments is not generally recommended." 
:Currency risk has no expected return. There is no evidence of persistent ability to generate profits from currency speculation. Investors should not use these instruments to make speculative bets on the direction of particular currencies against the dollar. Investors seeking the diversification benefits of foreign-currency exposure by investing in international equities that are unhedged for exchange-rate risk. On the fixed-income side, investors generally seek stability of the value of these assets, allowing them to take equity risks....

===Arguments for holding unhedged international bond funds===
Some Bogleheads forum posters hold foreign bond funds as a way of ''intentionally'' obtaining an exposure to currency risk, because they expect it to be ''favorable.'' In this case, "the investor's own view of the future path of the U. S. dollar" weigh in the balance. They might consider investing directly in foreign currency itself, but see bond funds as superior because of the intrinsic return of the bonds themselves.

Reasons for not seeing currency risk as a negative factor include these: a) for the foreseeable future, they expect it to be favorable, i.e. it is a safe bet that the dollar will not strengthen soon; b) in the long run, currency risk is zero-sum and should neither increase or decrease expected return; c) currency risk is uncorrelated with other asset price movements and may improve portfolio returns as a whole.

Swedroe et. all note, also, that "Some investors--such as those living part-time in a foreign country or planning to retire in a foreign country--may be sensitive to the prospect of a falling dollar. Such investors may benefit from hedging their dollar exposure as part of their fixed-income portfolio toward achieving this hedge."

==Market index==
The most recognized international developed market bond index is a subset of the Bloomberg Global Aggregate Index (also available in a float-adjusted version) which measures investment grade fixed-rate debt markets. The international developed market subset of the Global Aggregate Index consists of the following sub indexes:
*Two major components 
** Pan-European Aggregate
** Asian-Pacific Aggregate Index.

The remainder of the index consists of Global Treasury (ex US treasuries), Eurodollar, Euro-Yen, and Canadian index-eligible securities not already in the two regional aggregate indices.&lt;ref name="Barclays"&gt;[https://ecommerce.barcap.com/indices/index.dxml Barclays Capital Index Product Factsheets]{{dead link}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bloomberg also provides a benchmark for global inflation indexed bonds, the Bloomberg World Government Inflation-Linked Bond Index. The international subset of this index includes bonds from UK, Australia, Canada, Sweden, France, Italy, Japan, and Germany.&lt;ref name="Barclays" /&gt;

Morgan Stanley, Citigroup, BofA Merrill Lynch, and Deutsche Bank also provide international developed market indexes.

===Index funds===

Indexed portfolios of international developed market bonds for U.S. domiciled investors are currently available from ETF providers iShares and State Street Global Advisors. The portfolios are unhedged. Vanguard offers U.S investors hedged international developed market index funds in the form of both an ETF and a mutual fund. The firm uses the fund in the [[Vanguard four fund portfolio | four fund portfolios]] designed for its balanced [[Vanguard LifeStrategy funds]] and its balanced [[Vanguard target retirement funds]]. Dimensional Fund Advisors offer hedged short and intermediate term global bond funds, available to do-it-yourself investors in some employer provided plans (as well as a [[West Virginia Smart 529 Select plan | 529 plan made available by the state of West Virginia]].)

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' (ABS) are financial securities backed by a loan, lease, or receivables&lt;ref group="note"&gt; An amount due from individuals and companies. Receivables are claims that are expected to be collected in cash. From [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receivables Wikipedia].&lt;/ref&gt; against assets other than real estate and mortgage-backed securities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/asset-backedsecurity.asp| title=Asset-Backed Securities (ABS): Understanding Types and Their Functions| publisher=Investopedia| accessdate=November 15, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S., the ABS market started in 1985 when Sperry Lease Finance Corporation sold fixed-rate notes collateralized by computer leases. In 1986 GMAC issued notes backed by automobile loans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.econlib.org/library/enc/AssetBackedSecurities.html/| title=Asset-Backed Securities| publisher=Econlib| accessdate=November 15, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lehman Brothers (later Barclays Capital, now Bloomberg) introduced an index of asset-backed securities, the Bloomberg U.S. Fixed-Rate Asset-Backed Securities Index in January 1992 when it was also added to the [[Bloomberg US Aggregate Bond Index |U.S. Aggregate Bond Index]] in its entirety.

Common assets securitized into asset-backed securities include:
*Credit card receivables
*Auto loans
*Utility rate reduction bonds
*Home equity loans
*Student loans

Asset-backed securities are also used in the United Kingdom, Europe, Asia, and Emerging Markets.

==Structure==
Financial institutions, such as banks, credit card companies, auto finance companies, and finance companies sponsor asset backed securities by selling pools of loans to a separate special service vehicle (SPV) established for the sole purpose of securitizing the loans into marketable securities. The SPV sells the loans to a separate trust that actually securitizes the loans and then offers the asset-backed securities to investors. This process results in what is known as “bankruptcy remoteness,”  since the “true sale” of the loans by the sponsor to the SPV insulates the trust from the credit risk of the sponsor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.investinginbonds.com/learnmore.asp?catid=5&amp;subcatid=16&amp;id=10| title=Asset-backed securities| publisher=investinginbonds}}{{dead link}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to attain investment grade status, rating agencies require that asset-backed securities provide credit enhancements to the securities. These enhancements take the shape of both internal and external enhancements. These enhancements are in addition to the SPV structural elements which strip the sponsoring institution of ownership rights in the loan pools (so that creditors of the sponsor have no rights to the loan assets).
Internal enhancements include subordination, where the securities are issued in multiple tranches,&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Tranches: A piece, portion or slice of a deal or structured financing. This portion is one of several related securities that are offered at the same time but have different risks, rewards and/or maturities. "Tranche" is the French word for "slice". Source: [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tranches.asp Investopedia].&lt;/ref&gt; with senior securities (the first tranches) given protection from defaults: lower tranches absorb defaults before higher tranches. These senior tranches receive AAA ratings from rating agencies. Other internal enhancements include having higher collateral (the face value of loan portfolio is higher than the value of the security the collateral backs); and by retaining a yield spread (the security yield is less than the loan portfolio yield). The monthly excess spread is used to cover current-period losses and may be paid into a reserve fund to increase credit enhancement. A Reserve Fund is created to reimburse the trust for losses up to the amount of the reserve. It is often used in combination with other types of enhancement.&lt;ref name="Credit enhancement"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.investinginbonds.com/learnmore.asp?catid=5&amp;subcatid=16&amp;id=14| title=Credit enhancement| publisher=investinginbonds.com}}{{dead link}}&lt;/ref&gt;

External enhancements can include surety bonds, third party letters of credit, and cash collateral accounts.&lt;ref name="Credit enhancement"/&gt;

===Amortization===

The amortization&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Amortization: Paying off debt in regular installments over a period of time. Source: [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/amortization.asp Investopedia].&lt;/ref&gt; of an asset-backed security can take a number of forms, depending on the nature of the underlying loan or cash flows being securitized. Amortization can take the following forms:&lt;ref name="ABS structure"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.investinginbonds.com/learnmore.asp?catid=5&amp;subcatid=16&amp;id=15| title=How Are ABS Structured| publisher=Investinginbonds}}{{dead link}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
*'''Fully Amortizing''': Securities that return principal (such as auto loans, home equity loans, and manufactured housing contracts) to investors throughout the life of the security are designated fully amortizing securities. Depending on the underlying security, pre-payment risk may apply.&lt;ref name="ABS structure"/&gt;
*'''Controlled Amortization''': A method of providing investors with a relatively predictable repayment schedule, when the underlying assets (such as revolving credit card receivables) are nonamortizing. This method is similar to a sinking fund  used in conjunction with a corporate bond issue.&lt;ref group="note"&gt; Sinking fund: A means of repaying funds that were borrowed through a bond issue. The issuer makes periodic payments to a trustee who retires part of the issue by purchasing the bonds in the open market. Source: [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sinkingfund.asp Investopedia].&lt;/ref&gt; Controlled amortization is subject to early-amortization risk.&lt;ref name="ABS structure"/&gt;
*'''Soft/Hard Bullet''': This structure is designed to return investor principal in a single payment. The most common "bullet" method is a soft bullet, which is not guaranteed (the principal payment period can be extended). A bullet structure has two cash flow periods: a revolving period (when any principal repayments are used to buy more receivables) and an accumulation period when principal payments are set aside in an escrow account to fund the bullet payment. The accumulation period is similar to a controlled amortization and is subject to early-amortization risk.&lt;ref name="ABS structure"/&gt;
*'''Floaters''': Some ABS debt issues (such as auto loans and credit card receivables) have a floating interest rate linked to an outside index such as [[wikipedia:SOFR|SOFR]] (Secured Overnight Financing Rate) or the prime rate. In instances where the underlying collateral is comprised of fixed-rate loans, the ABS trustee will use interest rate swaps with outside providers to reduce cash flow mismatches.&lt;ref name="ABS structure"/&gt;
*'''Sequential Pay''': For subordinated ABS debt issues, principal payment is sequential, with the first tranche (with the shortest average maturity) retired first, before later tranches.&lt;ref name="ABS structure"/&gt;

==Risks==

Asset-backed securities are subject to the following major risks:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.investinginbonds.com/learnmore.asp?catid=5&amp;subcatid=16&amp;id=19| title=Market risks| publisher=Investinginbonds.com}}{{dead link}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Interest rate risk''': Asset-backed securities will rise in price as interest rates decline, and fall in price as interest rates rise. Some asset-backed securities, namely those collateralized by home equity loans and manufactured housing loans, are subject to pre-payment risk, the risk that borrowers will refinance loans when interest rates fall, resulting in the early return of principal, which now must be reinvested at lower interest rates.
*'''Early-Amortization risk''': Bond principal payments can be accelerated if any number of triggering events occur. These events can include insufficient payments from underlying borrowers, deteriorating excess spreads, or increasing defaults. Accelerated payments are a requirement of the rating agencies.&lt;ref group="note"&gt; Investopedia defines [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/early-amortization.asp Early Amortization] as:
{{blockquote| A type of credit enhancement used in certain asset backed securities (ABS). Early amortization is an accelerated payment of bond principal in an asset-backed security, usually triggered when there is a sudden increase in delinquencies in the underlying loans or when excess spread, the issuer's net profit after deducting servicing fees, charge-offs and other costs, falls below an acceptable level. Also called a payout event.
Early amortization signals liquidity crisis for the originator, as funding dries up. The early payout protects investors from prolonged exposure to receivables with deteriorated credit performance. However, the investor is relying on the fixed  income from the ABS - prepayment is an inherent risk for investors.
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Default risk''': The risk that an asset-backed security will default on the payment of interest and principal. According to S&amp;P, defaults on investment quality asset backed securities have been very low.&lt;ref group="note"&gt; The S&amp;P study, ''U.S. Asset-Backed Securities Have Maintained High Credit Stability And Low Default Rates Since 1983'', (May,2011) is unavailable. However, an S&amp;P sponsored video concerning the study, and the study abstract are available:
{{blockquote|1='''Abstract''': Although housing-related sectors suffered during the recent economic downturn, ratings on U.S. asset-backed securities (ABS) have generally remained stable. More specifically, 94.3% of 'AAA' rated U.S. ABS maintained their ratings or were paid off in full during the 12 months ended April 30, 2011. In other words, Standard&amp;Poor's Ratings Services lowered its ratings on only 5.7% of the 'AAA' rated securities, and none defaulted. (Watch the related CreditMatters TV segment titled, "U.S. ABS: High Credit Stability And Low Default Rates," dated June 17, 2011.) Looking back further, from 1983 through April 2011, 93% of U.S. ABS originally rated 'AAA' remained stable or were paid in full, and 0.10% defaulted. We lowered our ratings on 7.0% of these securities. Video link: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RE7e951II98 SP: U.S. ABS: High Credit Stability And Low Default Rates].{{dead link}} 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==ABS indexes==
Bloomberg (formerly Barclays Capital) provides an index of asset-backed securities, the Bloomberg U.S. Fixed-Rate Asset-Backed Securities Index. The index was introduced in January 1992 when it was also added to the [[Bloomberg US Aggregate Bond Index |U.S. Aggregate Bond Index]] in its entirety.
{{blockquote|
The U.S. Fixed-Rate Asset-Backed Securities (ABS) Index covers fixed-rate ABS with the following collateral types: credit cards, autos, and stranded-cost utility (rate reduction bonds). To be included in the index, an issue must have a fixed-rate coupon structure, have an average life greater than or equal to one year, and be part of a public offering.&lt;ref name="Barclays"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://ecommerce.barcap.com/indices/index.dxml| title=Barclays Capital Guides| publisher=Barclays Capital}}{{dead link}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Over time, the Bloomberg U.S. Fixed-Rate ABS Index has added and removed a number of security classes from the index. For example, the index added manufactured housing securities to the index in 1999 and removed them from the index in 2008. Home equity loan securities were originally included in the index, but were excluded from the index starting in 2010. 

Bloomberg also provides an index for floating rate ABS securities, the Bloomberg U.S. Floating Rate ABS Index. The index was introduced in May 2005 with history available from January 2005. This index is not included in the U.S Aggregate Index.
{{blockquote|
The U.S. Floating-Rate Asset-Backed Securities (ABS) Index covers floating-rate ABS with the following collateral types: home equity, credit card, auto (retail and wholesale loans), and student loans. To be included in the index, an issue must have a floating-rate coupon structure, have an average life greater than or equal to one year, and be ERISA-eligible.&lt;ref name="Barclays" /&gt;}} 

Merrill Lynch also supplies an ABS index, the Merrill Lynch US ABS Index.

Bloomberg supplies the following indexes for non-U.S asset-backed securities. As in the U.S., the fixed rate ABS indexes are included in the Bloomberg global and international aggregate indexes. The floating rate ABS indexes are not included in aggregate indexes. Euro and Sterling indexes were introduced in January 2004. The Pan-European indexes were introduced on March 25, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.barcap.com/About+Barclays+Capital/Press+Office/News+releases/News,1554,Barclays+Capital+Launches+Pan+European+ABS+Benchmark+Indices| title=Barclays Capital press release| publisher=Barclays Capital}}{{dead link}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Barclays Capital US FRN Sectors.png| thumb|right| 450px| caption| Figure 1. Bloomberg (formerly Barclays Capital) US FRN &lt;5 Years Index Sectors (Dec. 2010)]]
'''Floating rate bonds''' (also known as '''floating rate notes''' or''' floaters''') are securities which offer interest rates that periodically reset to changes in a  representative interest rate index. These securities were created during the volatile bond markets of the 1970s. Floating rate bonds are issued in both the U.S. and international debt markets. The financial sector is the largest issuer of floating rate debt in the U.S market (see Figure 1).

==Structure==
Floating rate bonds have the following features:&lt;ref name="SIMFA"&gt; [https://www.investinginbonds.com/learnmore.asp?catid=9&amp;subcatid=52&amp;id=275 Floating rate securities],{{dead link}} from SIMFA investinginbonds.com &lt;/ref&gt;
*''' Base index''': The interest rate of a  floating rate bond is determined by a floating reference rate, such as the prime rate, the fed funds rate, the [[wikipedia:SOFR|SOFR]] (Secured Overnight Financing Rate) or other benchmark interest rate.
*'''Yield spreads''': Yields are usually defined at a certain spread over or under the referenced benchmark index, such as the t-bill rate plus 0.40%, or the prime rate minus 2.40%.
*'''Reset periods''': The reset period determines how often the interest rate will be adjusted. The reset rate may be reset daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, semiannually or annually, depending on the terms of the bond or the characteristics of the benchmark index.
*'''Day count periods''': Floating rate bonds count the number of days in an interest payment period by using either a [[Bond pricing#Day_count_conventions | 30/360 convention]] (assumes 30 day months for a 360 day yearly period), an actual/360 convention (assumes the actual days of each month for 360 day year), or an actual/actual convention (using the actual days in both days and a year). The convention used will be defined by the bond issuer. 
*'''Payment periods''': Interest payments on floaters may be made monthly, quarterly, semiannually or annually.
*'''Maturity''': Floating rate bonds can be issued at any maturity.

==Performance characteristics and risks==
According to a Vanguard Research white paper, "A primer on floating rate bond funds",&lt;ref name="Primer"&gt; Bennyhoff, Donald G, Concannon, Brian M., and Zilbering, Yan , "[https://personal.vanguard.com/pdf/icrpfr.pdf?cbdForceDomain=false A primer on floating rate bond funds]",{{dead link}} Vanguard Research, (April, 2010) &lt;/ref&gt; floating rate bonds are subject to three major risk factors. These include interest rate risk, credit risk, and liquidity risk. The paper also examines the correlation of returns with other asset classes; the correlation of returns with inflation; the performance of floating rate bonds during periods of rising interest rates; and the portfolio effects of including floating rate bonds in investment portfolios. The paper measures floating rate bond returns using the Credit Suisse Leveraged Loan Index.

===Interest rate risk===
Due to the interest rate reset structure of floating rate bonds, the sensitivity of the bonds to interest rate changes is low. Morningstar reports that the average duration of floating rate bond funds is 0.45 years.&lt;ref name="Primer"/&gt; Floating rate bonds with longer reset periods may be more vulnerable to interest rate and price volatility.&lt;ref name="SIMFA"/&gt;

Floating rate bonds are also subject to ''spread duration''.&lt;ref&gt; Definition: The sensitivity of the price of a bond to a 1% change to its option-adjusted spread. As the rate of the Treasury security in the option-adjusted spread increases, the rate of the option-adjusted spread also increases. Source: [https://www.investorwords.com/6677/spread_duration.html InvestorWords.com].&lt;/ref&gt; Basically, spread duration approximately measures the change in a floating rate bond's price with changes in credit spreads. The price movement will be approximated by multiplying the change in the yield spread times the spread duration. Thus if a floating rate bond has a spread duration of 2.0 and the credit spread widens by 1%, the bond's price will decline by approximately 2%. In May 2011 the duration of the Bloomberg U.S. Floating Rate (US FRN) Note &lt;5 Years Index was 0.14; the spread duration was 1.8.&lt;ref&gt; [https://www.ishares.com/us/literature/brochure/mechanics-of-flot-en-us.pdf Mechanics of iShares Floating Rate Note Fund (FLOT)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Default risk===
Floating rate bonds are usually issued by companies that are below investment grade status. The average credit quality of floating rate bond funds is BB - B. However most floating rate bonds have senior claims in a company's capital structure, meaning they have the first claims on corporate assets during default.

===Liquidity risk===
Floating rate bonds are unlisted securities. The market is small compared to the broad bond market, and not as liquid. For example, during the 2008 financial crisis, liquidity dried up in the floating rate market, resulting in declines in bond prices and negative total returns.&lt;ref name="Primer"/&gt;

==US Treasury floating rate notes==
On July 31, 2013, the US Department of the Treasury announced the introduction of treasury floating rate notes (FRN)s, to begin auctioning in January 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.treasury.gov/connect/blog/Pages/Treasury-Expects-To-Hold-First-Floating-Rate-Note-Auction-In-January-2014.aspx Treasury press release], (07/31/2013)&lt;/ref&gt; Treasury FRNs are indexed to the most recent 13-week  Treasury bill  auction High Rate, which is the highest accepted discount rate in a Treasury bill auction. Treasury FRNs pay interest quarterly. 
&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.treasurydirect.gov/instit/statreg/auctreg/faqfloatingnoterate.htm Frequently Asked Questions on Floating Rate Notes (FRNs)], Treasury Direct.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indexes==
The most common index of U.S. floating rate bonds used as a benchmark portfolio for floating bond exchange traded funds is the Bloomberg U.S. Floating Rate Note &lt; 5 years Index:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/professional/products/indices/quote/BFU5TRUU:IND Bloomberg US FRN &lt; 5 yrs Total Return Index Value Unhedged USD]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{blockquote|The Bloomberg Capital US FRN &lt; 5 Years Index is a subset of the US Floating-Rate Note (FRN) Index, which measures the performance of USD denominated, investment-grade, floating-rate notes across corporate and government-related sectors. This index has a maximum maturity of 4.9999 years and is not part of the US Aggregate Index, which is a fixed rate index.}}

Other indexes that track floating rate bonds include the Credit Suisse Leveraged Loan Index and the S&amp;P/LSTA Leveraged Loan Index.&lt;ref&gt; [https://www.standardandpoors.com/indices/sp-lsta-leverage-loan-100-index/en/us/?indexId=spfi--ll--usd----t-------  S&amp;P/LSTA Leveraged Loan Index]&lt;/ref&gt; The Bloomberg indexes and the proprietary Market Vectors index hold much higher credit quality bonds than do the S&amp;P/LSTA U.S. Leveraged Loan 100 Index or Credit Suisse Leveraged Loan Index.

==Arguments for including floating rate bonds in portfolio asset allocations==
iShares argues that floating rate bonds can play the following roles in portfolio allocation:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ishares.com/us/literature/brochure/mechanics-of-flot-en-us.pdf Mechanics of iShares Floating Rate Note Fund (FLOT)]
&lt;/ref&gt;
* Adjust overall portfolio duration downward.
* Provide exposure to corporate bonds with reduced interest rate exposure.
* A diversifier within a traditional fixed income, as well as multi-asset class portfolio.

Vanguard research (August 2011) argues the following investors would benefit from including floating rate bonds in portfolios:&lt;ref name="Primer"/&gt;
* Investors who maintain highly bond-centric portfolios (80% or higher bonds).
* Investors who are averse to pure interest rate risk.
* Investors who are not averse to credit risk.

==Arguments against including floating rate bonds in portfolio asset allocations==
Vanguard research (August 2011) argues that most bond-centric investors are highly risk averse, and that exchanging interest rate risk for higher floating rate note credit risk falls outside these investors' risk tolerance. These investors would likely be better served by limiting portfolio volatility by holding short term treasury or short term investment grade bond funds.&lt;ref name="Primer"/&gt;

==Exchange traded funds==
Each of the exchange traded funds listed in the table below were introduced in 2010 - 2011, or are currently in registration. Note that the PowerShares Senior Loan Portfolio holds lower quality bonds (rated Baa - Caa) than do the other three ETFs (rated Aaa - Baa).

==Mutual funds==
The mutual fund fixed income universe of funds contains a large number of floating rate bond funds, almost all of which are broker-distributed load funds. Morningstar tracks performance of these funds, categorizing them as "bank loan" funds.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.morningstar.com/fund-category-returns/bank-loan/$FOCA$BL.aspx Bank Loan funds], from Morningstar.&lt;/ref&gt; The average expense ratio for active funds, as reported by Morningstar, is 1.15% per annum.

Floating rate bond funds are also available as [[:Closed End Funds | closed-end funds]]. These funds are traded on stock exchanges, often trade at discount or premium to net asset value, often employ leverage, and often use managed distribution policies. Most have higher than average expense ratios.

Active funds add to the risks inherent in investing in bond funds by introducing '''manager risk''', the chance that poor security selection or focus on securities in a particular sector or category will cause the fund to underperform relevant benchmarks or other funds with a similar investment objective.

*[[Treasury Inflation Protected Securities]] (TIPS), which are securities whose principal is adjusted by changes in the [[consumer price index]]. TIPS pay interest every six months and are issued with maturities of 5, 10, and 30 years.

In addition to being backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government, another benefit of marketable Treasury securities currently being issued is that they are not [[Wikipedia:Callable bond | callable]]. Some older issues available on the secondary market are callable.

See the linked articles for details on each type of marketable Treasury security.

==Nonmarketable Treasury securities==

There are several types of nonmarketable Treasury securities. The types that are of most interest to individual investors are U.S. Savings Bonds, which currently are issued in two series: [[EE savings bonds |Series EE]] and [[I savings bonds |Series I]].&lt;ref name=TD /&gt; See the linked articles for details on each type of savings bond.

The other types of nonmarketable Treasury securities are [[Wikipedia:Zero-Percent Certificate of Indebtedness#Zero-Percent Certificate of Indebtedness |Zero-Percent Certificate of Indebtedness]] and [[Wikipedia:United States Treasury security#Government Account Series |Government Account Series]]. The first of these may be of interest if you have a TreasuryDirect account.

== Role in a portfolio ==

Treasury securities are candidates for the fixed-income part of a portfolio. The primary risks of fixed-income securities are credit risk and interest-rate risk. However, because treasuries are widely considered to have no credit risk, this leaves only interest-rate risk as a primary consideration. Nominal Treasury securities (that is, Treasuries other than TIPS) also have inflation risk, and Treasury securities other than Treasury bills have reinvestment risk.

Because there is no credit risk, you do not need to diversify by holding a large number of Treasury securities. Nevertheless, you can find mutual funds that invest only in treasuries, and some investors use these funds for convenience.

Because of their short-term maturities, Treasury bills have very little interest-rate risk, and so are generally considered the safest type of fixed-income security. Treasury bills also have no reinvestment risk, so the nominal return of a T-Bill held to maturity is certain. See [[Treasury bill]] for more details on the role of T-Bills in a portfolio. FDIC-insured bank accounts and short-term [[Certificate of Deposit | Certificates of Deposit]] (CDs) are similarly safe alternatives for retail investors.

The interest-rate risk, inflation risk, and reinvestment risk of Treasury notes and bonds is proportional to their maturities (that is, longer maturity means higher risk). Most [[:Category:Bogleheads authors |Bogleheads authors]] recommend holding shorter-term fixed-income securities, including Treasuries, typically with maturities no greater than five years.

In conversation, you might hear "take your risk in stocks". This is suggesting moderation in bond investing. The potential reward for taking on risk with newly issued bonds held to maturity is limited by the coupon rate, whereas with stocks the investor shares fully in the up-side when risks are rewarded.

Some authors recommend holding longer-term nominal Treasury securities, especially if the investor has a high allocation to equities. A recent paper co-authored by [[Larry Swedroe]] presented evidence that this was an effective strategy. David Swensen advocates the use of long-term Treasuries held in small amounts as the perfect diversifier for equities; see: {{forum link| t=2409| title=Diversifying Power of Longer Term US Treasuries| date=May 9, 2007}}. Also, see [[Treasury bond]] for more on the role of longer-term Treasury bonds in a portfolio.

Others advocate including other types of bonds in the bond portion of the portfolio, giving higher yield and higher ''expected'' total return, but also higher credit risk. Advocates of this approach, including the ''[[Bogleheads' Guide To Investing]]'' authors, often include [[Mortgage-backed security | mortgage-backed securities]] (MBS) and [[Corporate bonds| corporate bonds]]. The popular Vanguard Total Bond Market Index fund holds corporate bonds and MBS as well as Treasury securities.

A common recommendation for the fixed-income portion of the portfolio is to hold some nominal bonds, including Treasury securities, and some real return bonds such as TIPS. Larry Swedroe suggests primarily holding TIPS and short-term nominal Treasury securities as the fixed-income portion of a portfolio. Maturities of TIPS can be extended because of the inflation protection feature. See [[Treasury Inflation Protected Security]] for more on the role of TIPS in a portfolio. 

Bogleheads author and investment manager [[Rick Ferri]] advocates the inclusion of a small portion of [[High yield bonds |high-yield bonds]] as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.rickferri.com/blog/investments/total-bond-index-funds-are-not-the-total-bond-market/| title=Total Bond Index Funds are Not the Total Bond Market| author=Rick Ferri| author-link=Rick Ferri| date=October 24, 2011| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141228234706/https://rickferri.com/blog/investments/total-bond-index-funds-are-not-the-total-bond-market/| archive-date=December 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Be sure to understand the rationale for, and the risks of, such a strategy before adopting it, because higher yield almost always comes with higher risk.

According to the '''Tax Reform Act of 1976'''  a fund must hold a ''minimum'' of 50% tax exempt bonds in order to qualify to pass tax exempt income to its shareholders.

Section 2137(c) of the Tax Reform Act of 1976, I.R.C. § 852(b)(5), provides in pertinent part: "If, at the close of each quarter of its taxable year, at least 50 percent of the value... of the total assets of the regulated investment company consists of [state and local government] obligations . . . such company shall be qualified to pay exempt-interest dividend . . . to its shareholders."  The section provides further that an exempt-interest dividend "shall be treated by shareholders. . . as an item of interest excludable from gross income."&lt;ref group="note"&gt;  For a consideration of this topic, see the notes to  [http://scholarship.law.wm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2408&amp;context=wmlr Muni-Funds: Exempt-Interest Dividends and the Feasibility of Underwriting Fee Recapture], 19 Wm. &amp;
Mary L. Rev. 519 (1978), p. 519. Retrieved 2 June 2012. &lt;/ref&gt;

In late 1976 mutual fund companies introduced funds investing in municipal bonds.&lt;ref&gt; [http://finance.yahoo.com/q/pm?s=VWLTX+Performance Yahoo finance], Vanguard's first muni fund. Retrieved 2 June 2012. &lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Balanced fund|balanced fund]] holding municipal bonds can hold a ''maximum'' of 50% stocks, and still qualify for the pass-through of tax exempt interest. These regulations account for the allocation policy of the Vanguard Tax-Managed balanced fund, which has a policy of maintaining a 50/50 target asset allocation between stocks and municipal bonds.&lt;ref group="note"&gt; The fund offers a portfolio balanced between a 45% - 50% allocation to stocks benchmarked to the Russell 1000 Index and a 50% - 55%% allocation to municipal bonds benchmarked to the Bloomberg 7 Year Municipal Bond Index. &lt;/ref&gt;

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' provides a mathematical background on the concept of ''duration''.

==Math==
[https://demonstrations.wolfram.com/MacaulayDuration/ Macaulay Duration], from Wolfram research, is a demonstration of Macaulay duration. From that page:
{{blockquote|Duration is associated with the slope of the price-yield curve. The absolute value of slope at any point on the price-yield curve is the Macaulay duration times the price of the security, divided by one plus the periodic yield.}} 

===William F. Sharpe===
The text below is a direct quotation from the [https://www.stanford.edu/~wfsharpe/mia/prc/mia_prc4.htm#duration Duration] section of [[William F. Sharpe]]'s [https://www.stanford.edu/~wfsharpe/mia/mia.htm Macro-Investment Analysis] textbook.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Permission to use this material is given [https://www.stanford.edu/~wfsharpe/mia/over/mia_over.htm here].&lt;/ref&gt;

{{blockquote|1=The maturity of a bond provides important information for its valuation. The values of longer-term bonds are generally affected more by changes in interest rates, especially longer-term rates. However, for coupon bonds, maturity is a somewhat crude indicator of interest rate sensitivity. A high-coupon bond will be exposed more to short and intermediate-term rates than will a low coupon bond with the same maturity, while a zero-coupon bond will be exposed only to the interest rate associated with its maturity.

To provide a somewhat better measure than maturity, Analysts often compute the &lt;em&gt;duration&lt;/em&gt; of a set of cash flows.

Let &lt;strong&gt;df&lt;/strong&gt; be a {1*periods} vector of discount factors and &lt;strong&gt;cf&lt;/strong&gt; a {periods*1} vector of cash
flows. The duration of &lt;strong&gt;cf&lt;/strong&gt; is a weighted average of the times at which payments are made, with each payment weighted by its present value relative to that of the vector as a whole. In the previous example, the bond has cash flows &lt;strong&gt;cf&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;pre&gt;
   Yr1      6
   Yr2      6 
   Yr3    106
&lt;/pre&gt;

The market discount function &lt;strong&gt;df&lt;/strong&gt; is:
&lt;pre&gt;
    Yr1       Yr2       Yr3
   0.9400    0.8800    0.8200
&lt;/pre&gt;

The present values of the cash flows are &lt;strong&gt;v = df.*cf''&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;pre&gt;
    Yr1       Yr2       Yr3
   5.6400    5.2800   86.9200
&lt;/pre&gt;

To compute weights we divide by total value, &lt;strong&gt;w = v/(df*cf)&lt;/strong&gt;, giving:
&lt;pre&gt;
    Yr1       Yr2       Yr3
   0.0576    0.0540    0.8884
&lt;/pre&gt;

In MATLAB, the expression &lt;strong&gt;[1:3]'&lt;/strong&gt;produces the {periods*1} vector of time periods:
&lt;pre&gt;
   Yr1      1
   Yr2      2
   Yr3      3
&lt;/pre&gt;

The duration, given by &lt;strong&gt;d = w*([1:3]')&lt;/strong&gt;, is 2.8307 years -- somewhat less than the maturity of 3 years.

Well and good, but what use can be made of duration? In some circumstances, quite a bit. In others, somewhat less. We make the calculation to better understand the reaction of the value of a vector of cash flow to a change in one or more interest rates. In practice, of course, many such rates along the term structure may change at the same time. In general, if the discount function changes from &lt;strong&gt;df1&lt;/strong&gt; to &lt;strong&gt;df2&lt;/strong&gt;, the present value of cash flow vector &lt;strong&gt;cf&lt;/strong&gt; will experience a change in value equal to:
&lt;pre&gt;   dV = (df2 - df1)*cf&lt;/pre&gt;

How can one number summarize the effect on value of a change in potentially many different interest rates along the discount function?

Of necessity, a change in the yield-to-maturity of a bond will cause a predictable change in the value of that bond or set of cash flows, since there is a one-to-one relationship between the two. The relationship holds as well for most cash flow vectors. In such case the term &lt;em&gt;internal rate of return&lt;/em&gt; is utilized, instead of yield-to-maturity. If there are sufficiently many positive and negative cash flows in a vector, the internal rate of return may not be unique, causing potential mischief if one relies upon it. However, this cannot happen if the vector consists of a series of negative (positive) flows, followed by a series of positive (negative) flows -- that is, if there is only one reversal of sign.

In practice, a bond's duration is usually calculated with a discount function based on its own yield-to-maturity, that is:
&lt;pre&gt;   [ 1/(1+y)   1/((1+y)^2)   1/((1+y)^3) ]&lt;/pre&gt;

Now, consider &lt;strong&gt;c(t)&lt;/strong&gt;, the cash for the t'th period. Using the bond's yield-to-maturity, Its present value is:
&lt;pre&gt;   v(t) = c(t)/((1+y)^t)&lt;/pre&gt;

If there is a very small change &lt;strong&gt;dy&lt;/strong&gt; in y, the change in v(t) will be:
&lt;pre&gt;   dv(t) = (c(t)*(-t*(1+y)^(-t-1))) * dy&lt;/pre&gt;
or
&lt;pre&gt;   dv(t) = (v(t)*-t) * (dy/(1+y))&lt;/pre&gt;

Summing all such terms we have the total change in value &lt;strong&gt;dv&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;pre&gt;   dv = sum(dv(t)) = - sum(v(t)*t) * (dy/(1+y))&lt;/pre&gt;

Finally, the proportional change in value, &lt;strong&gt;dv/v&lt;/strong&gt; is:
&lt;pre&gt;   dv/v = sum(dv(t)/v) = - sum((v(t)/v)*t) * (dy/(1+y)&lt;/pre&gt;

But the term inside the parentheses preceded with &amp;quot;sum&amp;quot; is the duration, calculated using the bond's own
yield-to-maturity. Thus we have:
&lt;pre&gt;   dv/v = - d * (dy/(1+y))&lt;/pre&gt;

Sometimes the duration is divided by (1+y) to give the &lt;em&gt;modified duration&lt;/em&gt;. Letting &lt;strong&gt;md&lt;/strong&gt; represent this, we have:
&lt;pre&gt;   dv/v = - md * dy&lt;/pre&gt;

Thus the modified duration indicates the negative percentage change in the value of the bond per percentage change in its own yield-to-maturity. The minus sign indicates that an increase (decrease) a bond's yield-to-maturity is accompanied by a decrease (increase) in its value.

Duration (modified or not) is of no interest unless one can establish a relationship between a bond's own yield-to-maturity and some market rate of interest. For example, assume &lt;strong&gt;y = y20+.01&lt;/strong&gt;, where y20 is the interest rate on 20-year zero coupon government bonds. In this case:
&lt;pre&gt;   dy = dy20&lt;/pre&gt;
and:
&lt;pre&gt;   dv/v  = - md * dy20&lt;/pre&gt;

which relates the percentage change in the bond's value to the change in a market rate of interest.

The concept of duration that is especially relevant for Analysts who counsel the managers of &lt;em&gt;defined-benefit pension funds&lt;/em&gt;. Many such funds have obligations to pay future pensions that are fixed in nominal (e.g. dollar) terms, at least formally. Moreover, the bulk of the cash flows must be paid at dates far into the future. The present value of the liabilities of such a plan can be computed in the usual way and its yield-to-maturity (internal rate of return) or &lt;em&gt;discount rate&lt;/em&gt;, determined, using market rates of interest. In many cases, the discount rate will be very close to a long-term rate of interest (e.g. that for 20-year bonds). Since term structures of interest rates tend to be quite flat at the long end, any change in the long-term rate of interest will be accompanied by a roughly equal change in the discount rate for a typical pension plan of this type. Thus the duration of the plan's cash flows provides a good estimate of the sensitivity of the present value of its liabilities to a change in long-term interest rates. Any imbalance between the duration of the assets in a pension fund held to meet those liabilities and the duration of the liabilities may well provide an indication of the extent to which the fund is taking on &lt;em&gt;interest rate risk&lt;/em&gt;.}}

A '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[bond]] issued in a currency other than the currency of the country or market in which it is issued. For example, a Japanese company might issue a bond in U.S. dollars in the United Kingdom bond market. Eurobonds are primarily issued by supranational organizations and corporations. Eurobonds are bearer bonds, and so are not registered. The holder or bearer of the bond is considered the owner.&lt;ref name="AMFE"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.investinginbondseurope.org/pages/learnaboutbonds.aspx?id=6368| title=International Bond Issues - Eurobonds| publisher=AFME| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160420163710/http://investinginbondseurope.org/Pages/LearnAboutBonds.aspx?id=6368| archive-date=April 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first listing of a Eurobond, the Autostrade issue for the Italian motorway network, took place on July 17, 1963 on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.luxse.com/about-us/our-exchange/our-history| title=We are leaders, not followers| publisher=LuxSE| accessdate=July 21, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bond types==
Eurobonds can be issued in the following forms:&lt;ref name="AMFE"/&gt;
* '''Conventional or Straight Eurobonds''' have a fixed interest rate and a set maturity term. 
* '''Floating rate bond notes''' (FRN) are usually short to medium term bond issues. The  coupon interest rate consists of two parts.  Interest floats in relation to a benchmark rate plus an additional spread reflecting the credit risk of the security. The reference benchmark rate is usually [[wikipedia:SOFR|SOFR]] (Secured Overnight Financing Rate) or [[wikipedia:Euribor|Euribor]] (Euro interbank offered rate). 
* '''[[Zero-coupon bond]]s''' do not have interest payments. Interest is paid at the maturity date of the bond.
* '''[[Convertible bonds]]''' can be exchanged for the common stock shares of the issuing organization. The bond issue sets a predetermined conversion price. The bondholder decides whether to convert the bond. 
* '''[[High-yield bonds]]''' are bonds rated to be below investment grade by credit rating agencies.

==Risk==
Eurobonds have the following risks:&lt;ref name="AMFE"/&gt; 
* '''Credit risk''', because the issuers can default. 
* '''Interest rate '''depends on the maturity of the bond. Credit and interest rate risk is normally higher for convertible bonds than for conventional bonds.
* '''Event risk''' for corporate issues, as changes in company fundamental fiscal conditions can lead to changes in credit ratings.

      <text bytes="15523" sha1="4v4vuzclf3zu5j2s3iglisxol43ogqn" xml:space="preserve">The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' of a fund is a standardized calculation of the fund's yield; this allows investors to compare funds from different issuers. For a bond fund, the yield is based on the [[Bonds:_advanced_topics#Yield_to_maturity|yield to maturity]], less expenses. For a stock fund, the yield is based on the dividend yield, less expenses.

==Definition==
Vanguard has a good informal definition: {{quotation|A non-money market fund's SEC yield is based on a formula mandated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that calculates a fund's hypothetical annualized income, as a percentage of its assets. A security's income, for the purposes of this calculation, is based on the current market yield to maturity (in the case of bonds) or projected dividend yield (for stocks) of the fund's holdings over a trailing 30 day period. This hypothetical income will differ (at times, significantly) from the fund's actual experience; as a result, income distributions from the fund may be higher or lower than implied by the SEC yield.

The SEC yield for a money market fund is calculated by annualizing its daily income distributions for the previous 7 days.|[https://personal.vanguard.com/us/glossary/t/GlossaryThirtyDaySECYieldContent.jsp Vanguard definition of SEC yield]{{dead link}}}}

The formal SEC definition&lt;ref name="SEC form"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.sec.gov/files/form-n-1a.pdf| title=SEC Registration form for open-end investment companies| publisher=SEC| accessdate=July 21, 2025}} (Formula on PDF pages 69-70, printed pages 58-59.)&lt;/ref&gt; gives the official formula

&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Yield} = 2 \left[ \left(\frac{a-b}{cd}+1\right)^6-1\right]&lt;/math&gt;

Where:
*a = dividends and interest collected during the past 30 days
*b = accrued expenses of the past 30 days
*c = average daily number of outstanding shares that were entitled to distributions
*d = the maximum public offering price per share on the last day of the period

It also includes clarifications of the definition. In particular, "Dividends and interest" for a bond is computed from yield to maturity, or yield to call if the bond is likely to be called, not the coupon payments on the bond.&lt;ref name="SEC form" /&gt; The reason for the 2 and 6 in the formula is that the SEC yield is twice the six-month yield. This corresponds to the way bond yields are reported; a $1,000 bond with a $10 coupon earns 1.00% every six months, and reports a 2.00% yield even though a 1.00% return every six months is a 2.01% annual growth rate.

==Bond funds==
For a bond fund, the SEC yield is related to the expected future total return. It will not match the return in practice, as bond prices change when their yields change, and funds do not hold bonds to maturity.

The examples in this section show how the SEC yield works with a bond trading at par and a bond trading at a premium, both with a 2.00% SEC yield.
* Bond A (par): A bond with 10 years to maturity and a par value of $1,000, paying a $10 coupon every six months, with a par value of $1,000 which will be paid at maturity. This bond is currently worth $1,000.
* Bond B (premium): A bond with 10 years to maturity and a par value of $1,000, paying a $15 coupon every six months, with a par value of $1,000 which will be paid at maturity. This bond is currently worth $1,090.23, calculated from the yield to maturity by compounding a 1.00% rate every six months as &lt;math&gt;15/1.01 + 15/(1.01)^2 + \dots + 15/(1.01)^{20} + 1000/(1.01)^{20}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The formula is described in [[Bond yield#Yield to maturity| Bond yield]]. The calculation can also be done with a spreadsheet as -$1,090.23 =PV(1%,20,15,1000,0). The negative sign in the result indicates the direction of cash flow.&lt;/ref&gt;
Similar calculations were used below to show how the value of both bonds relates to changes in their yield. A fund holding either bond would report a 2.00% SEC yield if it has no expenses, or a 1.90% SEC yield if it has 0.10% annual expenses.

===If yields stay the same===
Suppose that the SEC yields on both bonds remain 2.00% in six months. Bond A will be worth $1,000, with a 1% return from the $10 coupon. Bond B will be worth $1,086.13 = PV(1%,20-1,15,1000,0). The holder of Bond B received a $15 coupon but the bond price declined by $4.10 = (1090.23 - 1086.13), for a total return of $10.90 = (15 - 4.10), which is also 1% of the bond price (1090.23). If the yield on a bond (or on the bonds in a fund) does not change, its return over the six months is exactly half the SEC yield.

This equality also holds over longer periods of time, provided that all coupons are reinvested at 2% annually. Thus, over one year, Bond A would yield $20.01 = $10 + ($10 * (1.01)), including $0.01 of interest on the first $10 coupon reinvested for another six months. The annual return is 2.01% = effect(2%, 2), but SEC yield doubles the semi-annual return of 1.00% to get 2.00%, in order to match the rate on the bond.

===If yields change===
Six months later, the yields are now 2.1% (9.5-years until maturity). Bond A will be worth $991.43 = PV(2.1%/2,19,10,1000,0), for a total return of $1.43 = (10 - (1000 - 991.43)) which is 0.14% of its value. Bond B will be worth $1,077.15 = PV(2.1%/2,19,15,1000,0), for a total return of $1.92 = (15 - (1090.23 - 1077.15)) which is 0.18% of its value.

Alternatively, suppose that yields in 6 months are now 1.90%. Bond A will be worth $1,008.65 = PV(1.9%/2,19,10,1000,0), for a total return of $18.65 = (10 + (1008.65 - 10000)) which is 1.87% of its value. Bond B will be worth $1,095.20 = PV(1.9%/2,19,15,1000,0), for a total return of $19.97 = (15 + (1095.20- 1090.23)) - which is 1.83% of its value.

The same yield change thus results in almost the same total return change for both bonds. The reason that the total returns are not exactly equal is that Bond B has a shorter duration. More of its value is from the coupon payments, which are made in less than ten years and are thus less affected by changing rates. If two bonds have equal durations, their total returns will have identical response to small changes in rates (but not necessarily to larger changes because of [[Bonds:_advanced_topics#Convexity|convexity]]).

===SEC yield versus distribution yield===
Many sources report a ''distribution yield'' for a fund, based on the distributions it actually made. The SEC yield is a better estimate of future returns. The distribution yield is a better estimate of the types of returns (dividends versus capital appreciation or depreciation), which may affect the taxability of those returns.

The calculation of distribution yield is not standardized, but a common definition is the ratio of distributions over the last year to the fund price. Bond A has a 2.00% distribution yield, and Bond B has a 2.75% distribution yield. Regardless of what happens to yields, Bond A and Bond B will have almost the same total return, as shown in the examples above. Bond B will pay a higher dividend, but will rise less or fall more in price for any change in rates.

===Using SEC yield to forecast returns===
The SEC yield will only equal the return of a fund over a future time period if the yields on the bonds in that fund keep the same yield. For example, if a fund holds ten-year bonds, and next year's yields on nine-year bonds are the same as today's yields on ten-year bonds, then next year's return should equal the SEC yield. If investors expect the yield on a bond to rise or fall in the future, they expect a lower or higher return than the SEC yield.

In particular, if the yield curve is inverted, with longer-term bonds yielding less than shorter-term bonds, investors must expect yields to fall. Since a ten-year bond has significant interest-rate risk, investors are likely to buy ten-year bonds only if they expect higher one-year returns than on one-year bonds. If ten-year yields are lower than one-year yields, it is likely that nine-year yields next year will be lower than ten-year yields today, and investors expect returns on long-term bond funds to exceed SEC yields next year. Conversely, if the yield curve is very steep, investors expect returns on long-term bond funds to be lower than SEC yields.

====Cautions for specific types of bonds====
For some types of bonds and funds, the SEC yield is not a good indication of future returns. Some fund providers, including Vanguard,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/list/mutual-funds?filters=open| title=Vanguard mutual funds| publisher=Vanguard| accessdate=July 21, 2025}} (Click on the links in the SEC yield for high-yield, GNMA, international bond, and TIPS funds to see the cautions.)&lt;/ref&gt; include these cautions in links to SEC yield information.

For [[high-yield bonds]], the yield to maturity is higher than the expected return for holding bonds to maturity, because many high-yield bonds will default. Even if yields do not change, the return on a high-yield bond fund will be less than the SEC yield. (There is a similar but much smaller effect for investment-grade corporate and municipal bonds. If the default risk on a bond increases, the bond price will decline. The fund may sell the downgraded bond for a loss, or hold it and possibly take a larger loss if the bond defaults.)

For mortgage-backed bonds such as [[GNMA]]s, the SEC yield does not reflect prepayment risk, and mortgages are valued at their principal amount rather than the market price.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://am.jpmorgan.com/us/en/asset-management/institutional/insights/portfolio-insights/fixed-income/fixed-income-perspectives/the-truth-about-yield/| title=The Truth about Yield| publisher=JP Morgan| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20241204031753/https://am.jpmorgan.com/us/en/asset-management/institutional/insights/portfolio-insights/fixed-income/fixed-income-perspectives/the-truth-about-yield/| archive-date=December 4, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt; If mortgage rates decline, homeowners will refinance their mortgages, causing the principal to be paid out and forcing the fund to reinvest at lower yields. This is analogous to the call provision on many other bonds. The SEC yield can adjust for callable bonds by using the yield to call if a bond is likely to be called, but it cannot adjust for mortgage-backed bonds because mortgages can be called at any time (upon refinance, or when the home is sold). And if the SEC yield used the market value of a mortgage rather than the principal value, there would be a capital gain or loss when the mortgage was paid off; this is not a problem with conventional callable bonds because the market value of a callable bond will approach the call value when the bond is about to be called.

For foreign-currency bonds, the SEC yield is based on the yield in the foreign currency. For example, if a euro bond has a 1% yield, the fund uses that 1% for the SEC yield. If the dollar falls by 2% against the euro, a US investor would earn 3.02% in dollars. If investors expect the dollar to fall by 2% against the euro, the fund can guarantee the 3.02% return by currency hedging, but will still report the 1% SEC yield.

For [[TIPS]], the reported SEC yield may or may not include the inflation adjustment. If a TIPS yields 1% above inflation, and inflation last year was 2%, the fund could report an SEC yield of 1% above inflation, or 3.02% total. (Vanguard does not include the inflation adjustment.) When comparing TIPS funds, check that the definitions used are the same. And a bond fund which holds TIPS ([{{Vf|VFSIX}} Vanguard Short-Term Treasury (VFISX)] sometimes holds them) will report a lower SEC yield than the actual dollar yield of its bonds.

For a [[fund-of-funds]] holding bond funds, the SEC yield uses the distribution yield of the bond funds, as if they were stocks paying dividends. For example, [{{Vf|VTC}} Vanguard Total Corporate Bond ETF (VTC)] holds Vanguard's short-term, intermediate-term, and long-term corporate ETFs. If the individual ETFs have higher distributions than their SEC yields (because the prices of their bonds fell and the yields rose since the ETFs bought them), then VTC will have a higher SEC yield than the yield to maturity. Vanguard does not include a caution about this difference, although it can be recognized because the SEC yield of VTC is computed by the formula for stock funds.

===SEC yield as an estimate of risk===
Since investors trade bonds at prices which give an adequate compensation for risk, the yield to maturity of a bond is a good estimate for the relative risk of the bond, as estimated by the market. The SEC yield plus the fund expense ratio is the yield to maturity. If two funds of the same duration and bond type have bonds with different yields to maturity, the fund holding higher-yielding bonds presumably has higher credit or call risk.

Duration risk is not necessarily reflected in the SEC yield. If the yield curve is inverted, long-term bonds have lower SEC yields than short-term bonds because investors expect rates to fall, but the long-term bonds still have more interest-rate risk.

For comparing bonds of different types, the market price and thus the SEC yield are also affected by the tax treatment. A municipal bond with a 3% yield and a corporate bond with a 4% yield could have comparable risk, as investors with marginal tax rates over 25% would prefer to buy the municipal bond, while tax-sheltered investors or those with lower tax rates would prefer to buy the corporate bond.

==Stock funds==
For a stock fund, the SEC yield is useful for estimating tax costs, and understanding the type of stocks held by a fund. It is not useful in estimating future returns once the expense ratio has been taken into account.

The SEC yield of a stock fund is the dividend yield, minus the expense ratio. A fund with a high SEC yield thus holds high-dividend stocks, which may or may not have higher total returns. If the fund is held in a taxable account, the high dividend yield will lead to a higher tax bill, although this also depends on how much of the dividend is [[qualified dividend|qualified]].

===Distribution yield of a stock fund===
The distribution yield of a stock fund is based on the previous dividends (usually for the last year), while the SEC yield is based on the current dividend yield. These should usually be close. They may be different if stock yields changed, or if the fund recently bought higher-dividend or lower-dividend stocks. 

If a fund is growing, its SEC yield may be higher than its distribution yield, particularly if the fund pays dividends infrequently. Consider a fund which had $160&amp;nbsp;million in stocks a year ago, growing to $200&amp;nbsp;million when it distributed its last dividend, holding stocks with a 2% dividend yield. The SEC yield is 2.00%. If the dividends are paid annually, it had an average of $180&amp;nbsp;million in stocks on their dividend dates, so it received $3.6M in dividends and will report a 1.80% distribution yield. If the dividends are paid quarterly, the fourth-quarter dividend was based on an average holding of $195&amp;nbsp;million in stocks, and was thus $0.975&amp;nbsp;million ($3.9&amp;nbsp;million annualized), so the fund will report a 1.95% distribution yield for the fourth quarter, and a similar yield for the full year if the growth rate was consistent.

A '''market-linked CD''' (MLCD), also referred to as an equity-linked CD, market-indexed CD or index CD, is a [[Certificate of Deposit | certificate of deposit]] that ties its rate of return  to the performance of a securities or market index.&lt;ref name= "A Guide"&gt;[http://www.gobankingrates.com/cd-rates/market-linked-cd/ A Guide to Market-Linked CDs],Gobankingrates.com&lt;/ref&gt; There are market-linked CDs linked to stocks, commodities, currencies, as well as inflation. Chase Manhattan Bank of New York was the first to offer an equity-linked CD in March 1987, and at least nine other large banks subsequently offered these instruments during the year.&lt;ref&gt; Edwards, Michelle and Swidler, Steve, "[http://www2.stetson.edu/fsr/abstracts2/V14-4%20A3.pdf  Do equity-linked certificates of deposit have equity-like returns?]", Financial Services Review 14 (2005) 305–318 &lt;/ref&gt; 

For the most part, MLCDs are purchased through a broker or registered investment advisor.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wellsfargo.com/com/securities/fixed_income/market_linked_investments Wells Fargo]; [https://www4.harrisbank.com/investments/0,2289,8323118_41582234,00.html Harris Bank]; [http://financialservicesinc.ubs.com/wealth/Market-LinkedCertificatesofDeposit.html UBS] &lt;/ref&gt;
{{Warning|
''Market-Linked CDs are complicated investments which are '''''not recommended''''' for new investors. They are a type of ''[[Structured products | structured product]]'', but without the risk of losing principal. Please ask in the forum for advice.''
}}

==How a market-linked CD works==
A market-linked CD is an FDIC-insured certificate of deposit that ties the rate of return to the performance of a market index such as, for example, the S&amp;P 500 Composite Stock Price Index. The terms of these CDs vary; typically the term is five years.  The financial institution calculates your rate of return on the date that the CD matures based on the particular terms of the contract. Therefore, there is ''no guarantee'' that you will receive any more than the guaranteed payment.&lt;ref name="SEC"&gt;[http://www.sec.gov/answers/equitylinkedcds.htm Equity-Linked CDs], from the SEC&lt;/ref&gt;

Refer to Figure 1. The horizontal axis is the return of the market's index (annual), while the vertical axis is the market-linked CD's performance. During times of high market returns (right side of graph), the CD's return will track the corresponding index until it reaches its interest cap rate. Above that value, the underlying security will outpace the CD and represent lost income compared to the security, i.e. the market cap will limit the upside gains.

During times of poor market returns, the market-linked CD will limit losses by holding its principal value (left side of graph). As the underlying security's return continues to drop, the CD can go no lower than its principal value, and the investor is protected from losing the original investment. If the investment was instead with the underlying security, the original investment will not be recovered (loss of principal). In this sense, a market-linked CD provides downside protection.

The index return is calculated point-to-point, from the date the five-year term begins to when it ends. No interest will be paid during the five years. At the end of the five years, the investor receives 100% of the index return during those five years, subject to a cap of 60% cumulative. If the index return is negative, the investor gets the principal back without interest.&lt;/ref&gt;
|}

===Indexing method===
The most common methods used for calculating market-linked CD interest are a point-to-point method and an averaging method.

:* '''Point to point.''' This computation uses the starting point value of the index when the CD is issued  and the ending point value of that same index just before maturity as the reference points for interest return. The CD return is the difference, or, depending on the participation rate, a percentage of the difference, of this return.&lt;ref name="A Guide"/&gt; 
:* '''Averaging.''' Rather than calculating the return based on a starting and ending point, the values of the index along several “observation points,” or dates, are averaged.&lt;ref name="A Guide"/&gt; With averaging, the interest rates can be capped, and the sequence of returns can have large effects on the final return. There is no general rule for negative returns, as one specific CD may not have a floor for negative returns, but another may very well have a floor at each observation point.
Additional methods used for calculating interest include:
:* '''Sum of periodic returns feature'''. This computation is typically based on the sum of the returns measured over several set dates (monthly, quarterly, annually).&lt;ref&gt;See illustrative examples in [http://www.fisn.com/resources/pdf/Union%20Bank%20S&amp;P%20500%20MLD%20Sum%20of%20Qts_%204Yrs%2003-30-12.pdf Union Bank disclosure document]&lt;/ref&gt; Each period returns are often subject to a cap and/or a floor, where the floor on the downside may be significantly lower than the cap on the upside or where there may be no floor on the downside. As a result, the sum of periodic returns feature generally provides less opportunity for appreciation than a point-to-point return calculation.&lt;ref name="Wells Fargo"&gt;[https://saf.wellsfargoadvisors.com/emx/dctm/Marketing/Marketing_Materials/Structured_Products/e6440.pdf Guide to Investing in Market Linked Certificates of Deposit], Wells Fargo Advisors&lt;/ref&gt;
:*'''Contingent periodic interest feature'''. This computation pays periodic interest payments contingent on the performance of the components of a basket.&lt;ref&gt; For an example of a contingent periodic interest feature, see [http://www.fisn.com/resources/pdf/JPMorgan%20Chase%20Bank%20Commodity%20Basket%20MLD%20Ann%20Inc%207Yrs%2004-03-12.pdf Contingent Coupon Market-Linked Certificates of Deposit Linked to an Equally Weighted Basket of Commodities, Commodity Futures Contracts and Commodity Indices due April 2, 2019],JP Morgan Chase Bank. &lt;/ref&gt; The contingent periodic interest payments, if any, are based on the sum of the weighted component returns of each of the basket components. Typically, the basket components are equally weighted and there are limits to the positive and negative component returns for each applicable valuation period. In most cases, the limit for negative component returns is significantly lower than the limit for positive component returns. As a result, if the return of one or more of the basket components is negative during a valuation period, such negative component returns could offset entirely any positive component returns generated by the other basket components during the same period, and the periodic interest would be equal to zero.&lt;ref name="Wells Fargo"/&gt;

The term of investment, participation rates, interest rate caps, the presence or absence of a call provision, and minimum interest amounts are key elements in determining how much interest a market-linked CD will provide.

:* '''Term.''' An MLCD is issued with a set maturity date. Early withdrawals can result in stiff penalties.&lt;ref name="A Guide"/&gt;
:* '''Participation rate.''' The participation rate is the percentage at which an MLCD’s annual return will correspond to the performance of its target index. For example, if an index sees a 12 percent gain, and the CD linked to it has a participation rate of 75%, the CD will produce a return of (12 x 75%), 9.0 percent.
:* '''Interest cap.''' The CD may also contain a cap on the amount of interest an investor can earn. ''Example'': If the CD in the prior example (12 percent index return) had an 8 percent cap, this is what the investor would earn.
:* '''Call provisions.''' Some MLCDs have a call feature which allows the issuing institution to redeem the CD before it matures. The call price determines the investor's interest earnings. This can be lower than would be the case if the CD were held until maturity.&lt;ref name="A Guide"/&gt;
:* '''Minimum Indexed Interest Amount'''. Some MLCDs will provide a minimum amount of interest. For example, the  CD disclosure document may state that the CD will provide a minimum 2 per cent return over the term of the CD. This will provide a 0.5 per cent annual percentage yield (APY). At maturity, an investor will receive the greater of interest earned by the crediting method or the minimum indexed interest amount.

==Special considerations==
===Illiquidity===
Market-linked CDs are illiquid and are designed to be held to term.  There is no secondary market for the CDs. Early redemption can mean an investor will not get back the original deposit amount. Some MLCDs will provide scheduled early redemption dates, but the redemption value may be less than the deposit amount. Some MLCDs provide a survivor's option. In this instance, the CD issuer, in the case of death or adjudicated incompetence prior to the end of the CD term, will return the full original deposit, but no earnings, to the estate of the CD owner.

===Return scenarios===
The following MLCD illustration of return scenarios, as put forth in a First Union Bank disclosure document (for an S&amp;P 500  Market-Linked Certificates of Deposit, due March 30, 2016 (MLCD No. 198) will serve as a window on how the return method used by the bank affects the interest returned to the investor.&lt;ref name="Disclose" /&gt;

In this MLCD, the bank uses a quarterly capped sum of periodic interest computation for crediting interest. For simplicity, the illustration is based on a $1,000 initial deposit. Here are the details:

:* '''Quarterly percentage change''': is the lesser of the final quarterly value minus the beginning quarterly value divided by the beginning quarterly value; or the 4.00% quarterly cap. (Note that negative returns are not capped)
:* '''Indexed Interest Amount''': The sum of the 16 Quarterly Percentage Changes of the Investment Benchmark multiplied by the outstanding Deposit Amount on the Maturity Date.
:* '''Maximum Indexed Interest Amount''': 64.00% multiplied by the outstanding Deposit Amount on the Maturity Date. This equates to a 13.16% APY.
:* '''Minimum Indexed Interest Amount''': 2.00% multiplied by the outstanding Deposit Amount on the Maturity Date. This equates to a 0.50% APY.
:* '''Payment at Maturity''': The Deposit Amount plus the greater of (i) the Indexed Interest Amount or (ii) the Minimum Indexed Interest Amount.

The table below provides two scenarios. Both sequences end with same market index value (a 30% increase in market value) but the return sequence is varied. In the first scenario we are presented with a lower volatility general market advance, with only two negative quarters, and with only two quarters providing returns that are capped. This scenario provides a return that exceeds the minimum interest guaranteed by the bank.

The second scenario, although it ends ''with same market value'' as the first scenario, is punctuated by a two year bear market decline, followed by a generally sustained market rally. The scenario contains ten negative quarters, and four quarters with capped returns. This scenario produces a negative summed interest calculation, thus giving the investor the minimum interest (0.50%) guaranteed by the bank.

In addition, even if the the return scenario provides a positive sum under the averaging calculation, the MLCD might still only provide the minimum guaranteed amount if the return sequence includes a large percentage of negative return quarters. The disclosure document states: "The likelihood that on the Maturity Date you will receive only the return of your Deposit Amount and the Minimum Indexed Interest Amount increases as the number of negative Quarterly Percentage Changes increases." In addition, the document states that any single quarterly index return that equals or exceeds -58.00% will result in a minimum guaranteed interest payment.

If the crediting method in these two scenarios employed a full participation, uncapped point to point crediting method, the investor would have received a 30 per cent indexed interest amount, resulting in a $1,300 payment at maturity.&lt;ref&gt; For a scenario payout illustration from a full participation point to point payout MLCD, refer to the disclosure document for the [http://www.fisn.com/resources/pdf/Barclays%20Bank%20Q-GSP%20Large%20Cap%20Equity%20Index%20MLD%20Ann%20Int%20Pt-to-Pt%2003-29-12.pdf Barclays Bank Delaware Certificates of Deposit Linked to the Performance of the Q-GSP Large Cap US Risk Controlled 5% USD ER Index® due March 29, 2019]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Taxation===
From a tax perspective, MLCDs are treated differently than conventional CDs. They are subject to special rules which require inclusion of income based on a comparable yield and projected payment schedule, as well as a special rule which requires recognition of ordinary income on any gain realized on a sale or other disposition.&lt;ref name="Disclose" /&gt;

Holders of MLCDs are required to report to the IRS all payments of principal, any premium, and interest on the MLCDs, and the accrual of OID (Original Issue Discount). In addition, holders are generally required to report to the IRS any payment of proceeds of the sale of an MLCD before maturity.&lt;ref name="Disclose" /&gt;

If  held in a taxable account, the interest earned on an MLCD is treated as ordinary income&lt;ref name="Disclose" /&gt; and taxed at the [[Marginal tax rate | marginal rate]]. Furthermore, over the term of the CD, an investor is required to report this interest to the IRS and pay tax on this interest, even though the actual earned interest will not be determined until maturity of the CD. Thus, if the final interest from the CD is 0 dollars, an investor will have prepaid tax on non-earned income.&lt;ref name="A Guide"/&gt;

===FDIC coverage===
The FDIC deposit insurance will cover the principal of the market-linked CD (up to the per insititution insurance limit) but does not cover the interest until it is paid out at the CD's maturity.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;[http://www.fdic.gov/deposit/deposits/insured/index.html FDIC: Your Insured Deposits], from the [http://www.fdic.gov/ FDIC]. The FDIC does not insure money invested in stocks,bonds, mutual funds, life insurance policies, annuities or municipal securities, even if these investments are purchased at an insured bank.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Creating your own indexed CD ==
An institutional investor can mimic an indexed CD by buying a conventional fixed rate certificate of deposit or a zero coupon bond that will mature at the starting capital value. This assures the investor that, if the position is held to term, there will be no loss of the original investment.  The remaining capital not invested in the fixed investments can then purchase options on the market index the investor seeks to track.&lt;ref&gt; Edwards, Michelle and Swidler, Steve, "[http://www2.stetson.edu/fsr/abstracts2/V14-4%20A3.pdf Do equity-linked certificates of deposit have equity-like returns?]", Financial Services Review 14 (2005) 305–318&lt;/ref&gt; These can be stock market, commodity market, or currency market options.

However, the options available to individual investors cannot match those available to institutional investors which makes mimicing an MLCD unrealistic.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Because the CD terms are usually longer than the option terms a individual investor can find, buying options with the rest of the money is not a practical alternative. For example, an MLCD runs a 5-year or 7-year term but the longest option an individual investor can find in the market is 1.5 years or 3 years.&lt;/ref&gt; In general, there is no way for an individual investor to truly mimic an MLCD.

It is also possible to lose downside protection if the securities fail to perform as expected. See [http://thefinancebuff.com/a-case-study-on-an-index-linked-cd.html A Case Study on an Equity Linked CD] for an illustrative example.

A '''{{PAGENAME}}''' (BA) is a short-term [[Debt security|debt security]] created "when a time draft drawn on a bank, usually to finance the shipment or temporary storage of goods, is stamped “accepted” by the bank. By accepting the draft, the bank makes an unconditional promise to pay the holder of the draft a stated amount at a specified date.&lt;ref name ="Comptrollers"&gt;[http://www.occ.treas.gov/publications/publications-by-type/comptrollers-handbook/baccept.pdf Banker's Acceptances: Comptrollers Handbook.] 1999. Retrieved 22 April 2012. &lt;/ref&gt; Banker's acceptances are discount securities, usually having a three month or six month maturity, with the difference between the discount and maturity face value constituting interest. They are thus considered [[Money Markets| money market instruments]] along with [[Treasury bill|treasury bills]] and [[Commercial paper|commercial paper]]. The most common way an individual investor holds BAs is through investment in a general money market fund.

==History==
In the nineteenth century, banker's acceptances were primarily offered in England.&lt;ref name="Eichengreen"&gt; Eichengreen, Barry; Flandreau, Marc (July 2010).[http://www.bis.org/events/conf100624/eichengreenflandreaupaper.pdf" The Federal Reserve, the Bank of England, and the Rise of the Dollar as an International Currency, 1914-1939"]. Retrieved 22 April 2012. &lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S. banker's acceptances were introduced by the 1913 Federal Reserve Act, with primary motives including increased liquidity for the instrument as well as fostering U.S. international trade and commerce. The act made BAs eligible for Federal Reserve open market monetary operations until this provision was rescinded in 1984.&lt;ref name= "Comptrollers"/&gt;

Current interest rates on banker's acceptances are published by the Wall Street Journal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://online.wsj.com/mdc/public/page/2_3020-moneyrate.html Money Rates-Market Data Center], WSJ. Retrieved 22 April 2012. &lt;/ref&gt;

Historical interest rates are provided by the St. Louis Fed for the years 1940-2000 (see Figure 1). This series was discontinued in 2000. The chart shows the rise in banker acceptance interest rates during the inflationary decade between 1970 and 1981, as well as the fall in rates during the disinflation years between 1981 and 2000. In the "Great Recession" years (2008-2012), interest rates were well below 1 percent, although somewhat higher than rates on treasury bills.

Banker's acceptances are considered to be lower risk money market securities. The lower risk is due to the three factors backing the security: the goods being sold; the firm drawing the credit; and the bank that guarantees, i.e. accepts, the loan.&lt;ref name="Eichengreen"/&gt; During the Great Depression, the yield spreads between banker's acceptances and treasury bills remained fairly consistent.&lt;ref name ="Cole"&gt; Cole, Harold L.; Ohanian, Lee E.

'''Commercial paper''' is an unsecured, short-term debt instrument issued by a corporation, typically for the financing of accounts receivable, inventories and meeting short-term liabilities. Maturities on commercial paper range from 1 to 270 days.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commercialpaper.asp#axzz1sPzm55jg Definition], investopedia. Retrieved 18 April 2012 &lt;/ref&gt; Commercial paper is the largest component of the U.S. [[Money Market|money market]], and is a common investment vehicle found in U.S. money market funds. Commercial paper is not unique to the U.S. market, as it is issued in many national money markets. Similar to [[Treasury bill]]s, commercial paper is usually issued at a discount and is redeemed at face (par) value. The difference between these two values constitutes the interest earned by the investor.

==History==

In the U.S. commercial paper markets began in the nineteenth century, with non-financial firms such as textile mills and railroads issuing short term paper.&lt;ref name="Anderson"&gt;Anderson, Richard G.; Gascon, Charles S. (December- January 2009). ''[http://research.stlouisfed.org/publications/review/09/11/Anderson.pdf "The Commercial Paper Market, the Fed, and the 2007-2009 Financial Crisis"]''. Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis Review: 91(6) 589-612. Retrieved 18 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1919 the founding of General Motors Acceptance Corporation (GMAC) extended the commercial paper market to financial firms.&lt;ref name="Anderson"/&gt; The growth of consumer financing (autos and durable consumer goods sold with credit issued by finance companies) further expanded financial firm commercial paper.&lt;ref name="Anderson"/&gt; Demand for commercial paper grew with the creation of the money market mutual fund in the 1970s. Innovations in the 1980s included the growing dominance of dealer sold commercial paper (over direct company issuance) and the creation of Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Conduits (ABCP).&lt;ref name="Anderson"/&gt;

In 1970, the collapse of Penn Central, a transportation company, led to the company defaulting on its commercial paper. Loss of investor confidence following this default resulted in investors refusing to refinance maturing commercial paper. Aggressive lending by the Federal Reserve provided liquidity and stabilized the market.&lt;ref name= "Kacperczyk"&gt; Kacperczyk, Marcin; Schnabl, Philipp (Winter 2010). ''[http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~sternfin/pschnabl/kacperczyk_schnabl.pdf "When Safe Proved Risky: Commercial Paper during the Financial Crisis of 2007–2009"]''. Journal of Economic Perspectives Volume 24 (Number 1). Retrieved 18 April 2012. &lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 defaults in Bear Stearns hedge funds and term extensions in the ABCP market created a sequence of institutional "runs" on ABCP paper.&lt;ref name= "Kacperczyk"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Mary, [http://www.investopedia.com/articles/bonds/08/commercial-paper.asp#axzz1sPzm55jg Investors beware: These risks may not appear until times of market stress.],investopedia. Retrieved 21 April 2012. &lt;/ref&gt; The 2008 default of Lehman Brothers' commercial paper resulted in a money market fund, The Reserve Fund, "breaking the buck", with losses culminating in a 97 cent per share value, and a shutting off of redemption. The loss of liquidity resulted in a massive institutional run on money market funds, a sharp spike in commercial paper rates, and a growing lack of liquidity in the market.&lt;ref name="Anderson"/&gt; To preclude additional runs and bring back liquid markets, the Federal Reserve instituted multiple "funding facilities" to the commercial paper market and money market funds.&lt;ref&gt; See [http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/reform_cpff.htm Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF)], Federal Reserve; [http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/abcpmmmf.htm Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility], Federal Reserve, and the [http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/mmiff.htm Money Market Investor Funding Facility], Federal Reserve. Retrieved 19 April 2012. &lt;/ref&gt; These programs expired in 2009 and 2010.

==Market structure==
Commercial paper is loosely defined by issuer:&lt;ref name="Anderson"/&gt;
* Non-financial firm commercial paper;
* Financial firm commercial paper;
* Asset-backed commercial paper.

Standard &amp; Poor's provides the S&amp;P Commercial Paper Index, which consists of three indices: S&amp;P U.S. Commercial Paper Index (Total Return); S&amp;P U.S. Commercial Paper Financials Index (Total Return); and S&amp;P U.S. Commercial Paper Non-financials Index (Total Return). The indexes do not include asset-backed commercial paper. The index composition consists (2010) of 84% financials and 16% non-financials.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.standardandpoors.com/indices/sp-commercial-paper-index/en/us/?indexId=spfi--cp--usd----t------- S&amp;P Commercial Paper Index], Retrieved 18 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Commercial paper is also classified by its distribution, as direct sold paper and dealer sold paper. Dealer sold paper is the dominant distribution method.&lt;ref name="Anderson"/&gt;

Financial regulations also classify paper according to risk ratings provided by national credit rating firms (Standard &amp; Poor's, Moody's and Fitch). Paper is divided into Tier One paper and Tier Two paper. Money market funds are required by regulation to limit investment in Tier Two paper.&lt;ref group="note"&gt; ''Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 limits the credit risk that money market mutual funds may bear by restricting their investments to "eligible" securities. An eligible security must carry one of the two highest ratings ("1" or "2") for short-term obligations from one of the nationally recognized statistical ratings organizations (NRSROs), and, if the security is rated by two or more NRSROs, it must carry one of the two highest ratings from at least two NRSROs. A tier-1 security is an eligible security rated "1" by an NRSRO, and, if the security is rated by two or more NRSROs, it must be rated "1" by at least two of the NRSROs; a tier-2 security is an eligible security that is not a tier-1 security. Money funds generally may hold no more than five percent of their assets in the tier-1 securities of any individual issuer and no more than one-half of one percent of their assets in the tier-2 securities of any individual issuer; moreover, a money fund's holdings of tier-2 securities may constitute no more than three percent of the fund's assets.'' quoted from [http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/CP/about.htm Federal Reserve], Retrieved 19 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Risk and return==
As the history of the commercial paper market indicates, commercial paper is exposed to credit risk of default, as well as "rollover' risk, the risk that investors will refuse to refund paper once an issue has matured. As a result, commercial paper provides higher interest rates than Treasury bills. Credit ratings ascribed to commercial paper from rating agencies is provided in the following table.

{{for|additional information|wikipedia:Money market}}

{{PAGENAME}} are a collection of short-term investment instruments that are highly liquid and easily converted into ready cash. Because they are short-term, money market instruments rapidly adjust to changes in short term interest rates.

Investors hold cash investments for a number of reasons, for example as an [[emergency fund]], or for payments due in the short to intermediate term. Cash includes familiar bank instruments such as transaction and savings accounts, as well as short term bank [[Certificate of deposit|certificates of deposit]] (CDs). A certificate of deposit has a fixed term, and is less liquid than a deposit account because withdrawing principal early often has a penalty.

You can buy small denomination CDs directly from banks or from a brokerage. Cash held in any bank instrument is subject to credit risk in the case of bank failure. Bank deposits are generally insured up to $250,000 by the FDIC, and most depositors sensibly stay within these limits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.fdic.gov/deposit/deposits/| title=Understanding Deposit Insurance| publisher=FDIC| date=July 30, 2020| accessdate=August 26, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; The standard insurance amount is $250,000 per depositor, per insured bank, for each account ownership category.

Cash also includes some liquid securities bought and sold on the money markets. These include [[treasury bill]]s, institutional large bank CDs, [[commercial paper]], [[banker's acceptance]]s, and repurchase agreements (repos). Tax-exempt money market funds hold short term municipal securities.

== Marketable money market instruments ==
The main money market instruments are:

* [[Treasury bill|'''Treasury Bills''']]: Obligations backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, with a maturity of less than one year. T-bills are sold in denominations of $1,000 up to a maximum purchase of $5 million and commonly have maturities of one month (four weeks), three months (13 weeks) or six months (26 weeks). They are sold at auction at a discount, and the bill matures at par, the difference being the interest earned. Interest you earn on T-bills is exempt from state income tax, giving a tax benefit. T-bills are the only institutional marketable money market instrument that you can directly purchase. You can purchase them at auction through brokerages and banks, or through an individual account at [https://www.treasurydirect.gov/marketable-securities/treasury-bills/ Treasury Direct]. Federal agencies also issue short term instruments. Some of these have the full faith and credit backing of the treasury, but others do not.
* [[Certificate of Deposit|'''Bank Certificates of Deposit''']]: Market CDs are large, often multi-million dollar CDs offered by commercial banks and sold to large institutional investors. The New York branches of foreign banks issue Yankee CDs. Eurodollar CDs are dollar denominated CDs issued by foreign banks. As well as credit risk, Yankee and Eurodollar CDs bear sovereign risk; that is, the chance that a government might confiscate or freeze assets.
* [[Commercial paper|'''Commercial Paper''']]: An unsecured, short-term debt instrument issued by a corporation, typically for financing accounts receivable, inventories, and meeting short-term liabilities. Maturities on commercial paper rarely range any longer than 270 days. Corporations usually issue the debt at a discount, reflecting prevailing market interest rates. S&amp;P and Moody's rate commercial paper. For more, see: [[wikipedia:Commercial paper|Commercial paper]] from Wikipedia.
* [[Banker's acceptance|'''Banker's Acceptances''']]: A short-term credit investment created by a non-financial firm and guaranteed by a bank, often in connection with foreign trade. They trade at a discount from face value on the secondary market, and have a long history. For more, see: [[wikipedia:Banker's acceptance|Banker's acceptance]] from Wikipedia.
* '''Repos:''' Repurchase agreements (Repos) are made when a borrower deposits a treasury bill or other security as collateral with a lender who extends an overnight loan to the borrower. The difference in repurchase price determines the interest rate of the overnight loan. For more, see: [[wikipedia:Repurchase agreement|Repurchase agreement]] from Wikipedia.
* '''Municipal Securities''': Include a variety of short term municipal issuer short term instruments. These include general market notes, commercial paper, put bonds, and [https://www.msrb.org/sites/default/files/About-Municipal-Variable-Rate-Securities.pdf variable rate demand obligations (VRDOs)]. VRDOs comprise a significant percentage of the outstanding debt in the short term municipal market. They can be structured to provide a wide range of maturity options (1 day to over 360 days) to the underlying issuing entity and are typically issued at par. Municipal securities are exempt from federal taxation, although some private revenue securities are subject to the federal [[wikipedia:Alternative Minimum Tax|Alternative Minimum Tax]].

== Money market funds ==

Money Market funds are [[mutual fund]]s that invest in money market instruments. By design, they are meant to maintain stable [[Net asset value]] (NAV) of $1.00 per share, and provide investors with interest dividends. Money funds give you convenience, diversification of risk, and competitive short term yields (although the costs of investment are a critical factor in accessing the money market through funds). The underlying investments in the portfolio characterize money market funds. This specialization allows funds to differentiate by risk and tax characteristics.

Money market funds include:

* '''General Money Funds''': These invest in a selection of money fund instruments: treasury bills, CDs, Yankee CDs, Eurodollar CDs, Commercial Paper, and Banker's Acceptances. They are usually heavily weighted towards the non-treasury instruments. Because they are exposed to credit risks, they have higher interest coupons than treasuries (you can think of this excess interest as the default risk premium). The non-treasury component of a General Money Market Fund is taxable income for both federal and state tax.
* '''Treasury Money Funds''': Treasury money funds invest 100% in "full faith and credit" treasury bills and agency instruments. As a result they are not subject to credit risk (because the treasury has monopoly power to print fiat currency.) Treasury interest is exempt from state income taxation. Government funds include treasury securities along with other government agency paper not backed by the "full faith and credit" guarantee.
* '''Tax Exempt Funds''': These invest in municipal money market instruments. The interest is generally exempt from federal taxation, although some interest may be subject to the alternative minimum tax. State-specific Tax Exempt Funds invest in municipal securities of an individual state and so generate interest for state residents that is exempt from federal tax, state tax, and sometimes local tax. Tax exempt funds are subject to credit risk, as well as the risk of tax law change to their exemption status.

=== Money fund regulation ===

Rule 2a-7&lt;ref name="Rule 2a-7"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/17/270.2a-7#| title=17 CFR § 270.2a-7 - Money market funds| publisher=Legal Information Institute| accessdate=August 26, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[wikipedia:Investment Company Act of 1940|Investment Company Act of 1940]] regulates money funds. Key regulation provisions require the following:

* '''Maturity''': Money funds can only invest in money market instruments maturing under 12 months and must maintain a weighted average maturity of 60 days or less.
* '''Diversification''': Apart from federal government securities, money funds may not invest more than 5 percent of their assets in a single issuer.
* '''Credit Quality''': Money funds must limit their investments to securities that are rated in one of the two highest short-term rating categories by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization (NRSRO). Investment in second-tier securities is limited to 3% of total fund assets, with a limit of 0.5% for any single issuer. Investment in second tier securities is restricted to maturities of 45 days or less.&lt;ref name="Rule 2a-7"/&gt;

Under the 2014 final rules,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2014/08/14/2014-17747/money-market-fund-reform-amendments-to-form-pf#h-186| title=Federal Register :: Money Market Fund Reform; Amendments to Form PF| publisher=Federal Register| date=August 14, 2014| accessdate=August 26, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; money funds are divided into three classes: institutional, retail, and government. Institutional money funds must have a floating NAV based on market values. The rules also provide for liquidity (redemption) fees and gates (suspended redemption) during periods of market distress. In summary:

* A fund may impose a fee of up to 2% on redemptions if a fund's weekly liquid assets fall below 30% of its total assets.
* A fund must impose a 1% fee on redemptions (with the option of imposing a fee of up to 2%) if its weekly liquid assets fall below 10% of its total assets, unless the fund's board determines a fee would not be in the fund's best interest.
* A fund may impose a gate (that is, suspend redemptions) for up to 10 business days in a 90-day period.
* The fees and gates rules only apply to retail and institutional funds, although government funds may voluntarily adopt them if the fees and gates are previously disclosed to investors.

=== Breaking the buck ===
{{Main|The 2008 money market crisis}}

Although money-market funds are low risk, they are not zero-risk. If some of the underlying investments default, the fund may not be able to maintain a net asset value of $1.00/share. This failure is colloquially known as ''breaking the buck''. 

Since their introduction in 1971, money market funds have ''broken the buck'' on only two occasions. Most notably, in September 2008 three money-market funds of The Reserve ''broke the buck'' after Lehman went bankrupt.

A fund files the monthly market price value ("shadow price") of money market funds, along with copious amounts of other information on fund holdings, with the SEC on form N-MFP. The table below has links to these reports for Vanguard's low-cost money market funds.

=== Default risk premium ===

Default risk premium refers to the additional return from investing in securities with a risk of default, where treasuries and other securities backed by the full faith and credit of the US government are considered to have no default risk.

If there were no default premium, then investors would have no incentive to invest in anything but treasuries. Investment costs have a direct impact on how much of the default risk premium a money market fund investor can earn. Indeed, the high costs of the average money fund totally consume the default risk premium.

As a result, investors are often exposed to 100% credit default risk without receiving any compensation over the default free treasury bill. If you hold General Money Market Funds you need to keep control of costs if you want to gain any of the default risk premium.

=== After-tax yields ===
If you are comfortable bearing default risk, you can choose a money market return using the fund's after-tax return. The calculator below (courtesy of the The Financial Buff blog) analyzes money funds, taking into account all taxable input federal, state, and alternative minimum tax.

* [https://files.thefinancebuff.com/calculators/Bond-Funds-Yield-Calculator.html Bond Fund Yield Calculator]

The fund provider can give you the percentage of a tax-exempt money fund's assets held in securities subject to the alternative minimum tax.

{{for|additional information|wikipedia:United States Treasury security}}

In the U.S., '''Treasury bills''' (T-bills) are short term debt instruments issued and backed by the "full faith and credit" of the U.S. Treasury. The Treasury issues bills for terms of 4, 6, 8, 13, 17, 26, and 52 weeks.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Compare to [[Treasury bond | Treasury bonds]], which the US Treasury issues in two maturity ranges (Reference: [http://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/products/products.htm Treasury Direct: Treasury Securities &amp; Programs]):
*Notes have a range between one year and ten years;
*Bonds have a range greater than ten years.&lt;/ref&gt;

Treasury bills are sold at regular auctions, and institutional investors bid on the prices they are willing to pay the treasury for its debt.&lt;ref&gt;Fleming, Michael J. (January 2007). [https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/current_issues/ci13-1.html "Who Buys Treasury Securities at Auction?"]. Current Issues in Economics and Finance, Volume 13, Number 1. Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Retrieved 12 March 2023.&lt;/ref&gt; Bills are issued at a discount to face value and reach full value (par value) at maturity. The difference between the discount price and par value is the interest earned. The first regular auctions of US Treasury bills began on December 17, 1929.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Timeline of U.S. Treasury Bills |url=https://treasurydirect.gov/research-center/timeline/bills/ |access-date=2023-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treasury bill interest==
The formula for computing the yield of a T-bill is: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;math&gt;\text{Discount Yield} (%) = \frac{\text{Face Value} - \text{Purchase Price}}{\text{Face Value}} \times \frac{\text{360}}{\text{Days Till Maturity}} \times 100[%]&lt;/math&gt; 

==Purchasing treasury bills==
You can buy T-bills from banks, brokers, and directly from the treasury through Treasury Direct. As noted, T-bills are auctioned in seven maturities:&lt;ref group="note"&gt; The treasury also issues very short term cash management bills which are usually issued with maturities lasting only a matter of days. &lt;/ref&gt;

* '''4-week bill''': also called a "one month" or "30-day" T-bill.
* '''6-week bill''': (no alternative name)
* '''8-week bill''': (no alternative name)
* '''13-week bill''': also called a "three month" or "90-day" T-bill.
* '''17-week bill''': also called a "four month" T-bill.
* '''26-week bill''': also called a "six month" or "180-day" T-bill.
* '''52-week bill''': also called a "one year" or "360-day" T-bill.

All bills except 52-week bills are auctioned every week. The 52-week bill is auctioned every four weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Treasury Bills|url=https://www.treasurydirect.gov/marketable-securities/treasury-bills/|access-date=March 14, 2023|website=TreasuryDirect.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

You can also gain access to Treasury bills by investing in a U.S. Treasury money market fund.{{#tag:ref|The following no-load fund groups provide U.S. Treasury only money market funds.

==Risk==
T-bills have no credit risk (assuming no government currency default) on the payment of interest and return of capital. However, they do have inflation risk, because T-bills do not always outpace inflation.

In addition, as the short term interest rate can fluctuate significantly over a short period, T-bills have income risk; that is, the chance that interest income will decline because of falling interest rates. 

==Role in a portfolio==
You can use T-bills for the following purposes:

* '''General savings vehicle'''. You can fund short term requirements for a large amount of cash (car, college tuition, vacation, etc) with T-bills that will mature just before the date the expense arrives.
* '''Emergency reserves.''' You can use T-bills as part of your [[Emergency fund |emergency fund]], designed to provide a cushion of liquidity&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidity.asp Liquidity], on Investopedia&lt;/ref&gt; in the event of unexpected expenses or of a loss of regular income due to unemployment.
* '''Asset allocation''': They can form part of fixed income allocation in a retirement portfolio.

==Taxation==
The interest income from a Treasury bill is exempt from state and local income tax. Because T-bills are discount securities, and income is credited at maturity of the bill, you can use T-bills to shift income from one calendar tax year to the next tax year by purchasing a T-bill that matures after December 31 of the current year.

The '''2008 financial crisis''' triggered a '''money market crisis''' that included the failure of the original and oldest U.S. [[Money Market|money fund]], the $62 billion Reserve Primary Fund, which broke the one dollar [[Net asset value|net asset value]] mark (known as breaking the buck) in September 2008. An ensuing net redemption of prime money market funds&lt;ref group="note"&gt; Prime money market funds invest in a wide array of money fund instruments: [[Treasury bills|treasury bills]], CDs, Yankee CDs, Eurodollar CDs, [[Commercial paper|commercial paper]], and [[Banker's acceptance|banker's acceptances]]. These funds are usually heavily weighted towards the non-treasury instruments. &lt;/ref&gt; by both institutional and retail investors was counterbalanced by an inflow of funds to [[Treasury bill|treasury]] and government money funds. Government action during the crisis included the formation of emergency measures designed to support and stabilize money markets. Subsequently, the government instituted money market fund reform measures in 2010, with a second round of reforms added in 2014.

In August 2007, widening spreads in the [[Commercial paper|commercial paper]] market, combined with [[Mortgage-backed security|mortgage security]] losses, resulted in the default of several structured investment vehicles.&lt;ref group="note"&gt; Investopedia defines ''structured investment vehicles (SIV) as: {{blockquote| A pool of investment assets that attempts to profit from credit spreads between short-term debt and long-term structured finance products such as asset-backed securities (ABS).

The SIV earns profits on the spread between incoming cash flows (principal and interest payments on ABS) and the high-rated commercial paper that it issues.

Financial difficulties continued into the spring of 2008, with the failure of auctions for auction-rate securities.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=awCJRyi5ngcQ&amp;refer=us Florida Schools, California Convert Auction-Rate Debt (Update5], February 22, 2008, Bloomberg &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.finra.org/Investors/ProtectYourself/InvestorAlerts/Bonds/P038207 Auction Rate Securities: What Happens When Auctions Fail], FINRA &lt;/ref&gt; In March 2008, Bear Stearns, a global investment bank and securities trading and brokerage firm, became insolvent.

The 2008 financial crisis reached its climax during the month of September (see accompanying table for a timeline of September events).

On September 7, the large U.S. mortgage Government Sponsored Enterprises, [[Fannie Mae]] and [[Freddie Mac]], were declared insolvent and placed in conservatorship. On September 14, the Bank of America bought the insolvent Merrill Lynch brokerage. On September 15, Lehman Brothers, a global financial services firm, declared bankruptcy. Investors began selling prime money market funds on Friday, September 12, and continued selling them on Monday, September 15.&lt;ref name="RSFI"&gt;[http://www.sec.gov/news/studies/2012/money-market-funds-memo-2012.pdf Response to Questions Posed by Commissioners Aguilar, Paredes, and Gallagher], RSFI, November 30, 2012 &lt;/ref&gt; 

On Tuesday, September 16, the Reserve Primary Fund, holding $785 million of defaulted Lehman Brothers commercial paper, announced that, due to the default, the net asset value of the money fund had broken the $1.00 net asset value mark and was now valued at $0.97.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=a5O2y1go1GRU Reserve Primary Money Fund Falls Below $1 a Share (Update4)], September 2008, Bloomberg&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next four days investors withdrew $23 billion and made redemption requests of $60 billion from the $62 billion dollar fund.&lt;ref group="note"&gt; The Reserve Fund received permission from the SEC to suspend redemptions from its money market funds on September 22, 2008 ([http://www.primary-yieldplus-inliquidation.com/pdf/PressReleaseStatementofOrderPurpose2008_0923.pdf Press release], September 23, 2008.) The actual liquidation and dispensing of the Reserve Fund's family of money market fund assets took years to complete. On January 26, 2010, with the sixth distribution of fund assets, the fund had returned $55 billion dollars, or 99% of fund assets. A record of the funds' liquidation is preserved in [http://www.primary-yieldplus-inliquidation.com/archive.html The Reserve Fund Archive]. &lt;br&gt; In addition to the Reserve Fund, two other smaller funds also "broke the buck" due to holdings of defaulted Lehman Brothers commercial paper: the Reserve Yield Plus Fund, classified as a short-term bond fund, saw its net asset value drop to $0.97 a share: (See [http://www.primary-yieldplus-inliquidation.com/pdf/PressReleaseYieldPlus2008_1017Final.pdf press release]); and the Reserve International Liquidity Fund, which had a drop in net asset value to $0.91: (See [http://www.investopedia.com/articles/mutualfund/09/break-the-buck-money-market.asp Breaking The Buck: Why Low Risk Is Not Risk-Free], investopedia) &lt;/ref&gt; In addition, a number of money funds received sponsor support, through either capital infusion or purchase of discounted paper at book value, during this period.&lt;ref group="note"&gt; Brady, Steffanie A; Ken E. Anadu, and Nathaniel R. Cooper (August 13 2012). [http://www.bos.frb.org/bankinfo/qau/wp/2012/qau1203.htm "The Stability of Prime Money Market Mutual Funds: Sponsor Support from 2007 to 2011"]. Federal Reserve Bank of Boston (Working Paper No. RPA12-3) report that:
{{blockquote| Large sponsor support (in aggregate) representing over 0.5 percent of assets under management (AUM), occurred in 31 money market funds, and the primary reason disclosed was losses on Lehman Brothers, AIG, and Morgan Stanley securities.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the calendar week of the crisis, institutional prime funds had large net outflow every day while retail prime funds had net outflow Wednesday through Friday. Institutional government and retail government funds received large daily net inflow during this period. Between February 9 and October 7 2008, government money market fund assets increased by $409 billion (44 percent) as prime fund assets fell by $498 billion (24 percent).&lt;ref name="RSFI"/&gt;

At this point, the market for commercial paper became illiquid. Issuers generally issued, and buyers generally were only willing to buy, overnight issues of commercial paper. Longer maturities did not trade.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ici.org/pdf/ppr_09_mmwg.pdf Report of the Money Market Working Group], ICI Money Market Working Group, March 17, 2009], p.60 &lt;/ref&gt;

On September 19, the U.S. Treasury announced the establishment of a temporary guarantee program to protect shareholders of money market mutual funds.&lt;ref group="note"&gt; Although the U.S Treasury deposit insurance program for prime money funds instilled confidence in money fund investors and stemmed the outflow of investor assets, the funds continued to sell commercial paper and buy treasuries. Within one month after Lehman’s bankruptcy, money market funds' commercial paper holdings fell from 24.2 to 16.9 percent of fund assets. Over the same period, money market funds increased government debt holdings from 36.7 to 44.5 percent of assets. See Kacperczyk, Marcin T. and Schnabl, Philipp,, 2010. [http://www.nber.org/papers/w15538 "When Safe Proved Risky: Commercial Paper during the Financial Crisis of 2007-2009,"] Journal of Economic Perspectives, American Economic Association, vol. 24(1), p.19.&lt;/ref&gt; Three additional programs were initiated in September and October:&lt;ref group="note"&gt; Each program had a specific purpose and a finite life span:
* ''' Treasury Guarantee Program for Money Market Funds''' provided insurance for investor money fund accounts. The program was initially in effect for three months, beginning September 19, 2008, but was later extended through September 18, 2009. Treasury did not extend the program beyond September 18, 2009.
* '''Money Market Investor Funding Facility (MMIFF)''' provided liquidity to U.S. money market mutual funds in order to increase their ability to meet redemption requests and to enhance money market investors' willingness to invest in money market instruments, particularly for terms longer than overnight. The facility was announced on October 21, 2008, and was closed on October 30, 2009. 
* '''Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility (AMLF)''' provided liquidity that allowed money funds to sell asset-backed commercial paper. The facility was announced on September 19, 2008, and was closed on February 1, 2010. 
* '''Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF)''' allowed the Federal Reserve to directly purchase commercial paper, providing liquidity to the market. The facility was announced on October 7, 2008, began purchases of commercial paper on October 27, 2008, and was closed on February 1, 2010.

The programs were aimed at increasing liquidity within the commercial paper market. The intervention succeeded in halting the run on prime money fund assets, and unlocked the commercial paper market.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;

==Explanations for money fund redemption==
[[File:Moneyfundcharts.gif|thumb|right|290px|Figure 1. Prime money fund assets&lt;ref name="McCabe"&gt;McCabe, Patrick E. (2010). [http://federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/2010/201051/201051abs.html "The Cross Section of Money Market Fund Risks and Financial Crises"]. FEDS Working Papers. 2010-51.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The September 2008 run on prime money market funds (see figure 1 for a chart of prime money fund asset levels over the period) has led investors, academics and financial market regulators to seek plausible explanations for investor conduct. The most commonly cited investor motivations include investor flights to quality; flights to liquidity; flights to transparency; and flights to performance. 

; Flight to quality. 
During the crisis period, investors shifted from money funds that held securities subject to default to treasury/government funds that possess low default risk. Both Wermers (2012)&lt;ref name="Wermers"/&gt; and McCabe (2010)&lt;ref name="McCabe"/&gt; also point out that investors shifted funds to prime funds that were judged capable of providing sponsor support if needed. (See table three in figure 1; note that of 116 institutional prime money funds, ten saw assets shrink by more than 50 percent during this period and another twelve lost between 40 and 50 percent of assets, but 20 had net inflows over the same period.)&lt;ref group="note"&gt; McCabe examines three risk factors faced by institutional money fund investors: (1) portfolio risks arising from a fund's assets, (2) investor risk reflecting the likelihood that a fund's shareholders will redeem shares disruptively, and (3) sponsor risk due to uncertainty about MMF sponsors' support for distressed funds. He finds that funds that had provided higher gross yields (holding higher risk securities), showed higher pre-crisis volatility of fund flows (indicating higher investor risk), and funds with sponsors with higher default/swap spreads (indicating less likelihood of offering support) all experienced outflows during the crisis. &lt;/ref&gt; 

;Flight to liquidity. 
Institutional investors require immediate access to their cash holdings. The most liquid money market securities are treasury bills and other government securities. The shift to treasury/government funds during the crisis is an indication of investor preference for liquidity. 

;Flight to transparency.
With the risk of default rising, investors sought funds with the highest levels of portfolio transparency. Since treasury/government funds, by prospectus policy, hold at least 80% of the portfolio in treasury securities, they offer reliable transparency. The crisis also encouraged prime money market managers to release current information on fund holdings and issue statements to investors.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/18/business/yourmoney/18money.html?_r=0 Money Market Funds Enter a World of Risk ], New York Times, September 17, 2008 &lt;/ref&gt;

;Flight to performance.
The SEC's RSFI cite academic research that provides evidence that higher performance attracts additional flows.&lt;ref name="RSFI"/&gt;

==The 2010 money market fund reforms==

The 2008 money market crisis provided an impetus to both industry and regulators to produce reform measures.
 
On November 4, 2008, the mutual fund trade organization, the Investment Company Institute (ICI), announced the formation of a panel of fund industry leaders with a mandate "to develop recommendations to improve the functioning of the money market and the operation and regulation of funds investing in that market." Former Vanguard CEO [[John J. Brennan |John Brennan]] chaired the panel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ici.org/policy/current_issues/08_news_mm_group CI Establishes Money Market Working Group]&lt;/ref&gt;

The panel presented its completed report to the ICI's Board on March 17, 2009. The report offered 24 recommended actions for improving fund safety.&lt;ref group="note"&gt; The ICI’s Money Market Working Group recommendations are summarized in this [http://www.ici.org/pdf/09_mmwg_facts_recommendations.pdf Factsheet].&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 23, 2010, the SEC adopted three amendments to rule 2a-7 which governs money market funds. The rules were effective June 30, 2010.&lt;ref name="RSFI"/&gt; The changes to existing rules were as follows: 
# The Weighted Average Maturity (WAM) for money market funds is reduced from 90 days to 60 days.
# Liquidity buffers are introduced for taxable money market funds (a minimum 10% of assets must be cash, treasury securities, or securities that convert to cash in one day; a minimum 30% of assets must be cash, treasury securities or certain government securities with remaining maturities of 60 days or less, or securities that convert to cash within one week.) 
# Tighter restrictions on the amount of higher risk second-tier securities a money fund can hold (now a maximum limit of 3% from the former limit of 5%; and a maximum limit of 0.5% to any single issuer, from a prior limit of 1%.) Investment in second tier securities is restricted to maturities of 45 days or less.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.sec.gov/rules/final/2010/rule2a-7amendments.pdf Amended Rule 2a-7 (2010)] &lt;/ref&gt;

==The 2014 money market fund reforms==

On July 14, 2014 the SEC issued final rules that "... make structural and operational reforms to address risks of investor runs in money market funds, while preserving the benefits of the funds."&lt;ref name="SEC press release"&gt;[http://www.sec.gov/News/PressRelease/Detail/PressRelease/1370542347679 SEC Adopts Money Market Fund Reform Rules ], press release &lt;/ref&gt;

The SEC’s final rules&lt;ref&gt; [https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2014/08/14/2014-17747/money-market-fund-reform-amendments-to-form-pf#h-64 Money Market Fund Reform; Amendments to Form PF], full SEC final regulations &lt;/ref&gt;
"... require a floating net asset value (NAV) for institutional prime money market funds, which allows the daily share prices of these funds to fluctuate along with changes in the market-based value of fund assets and provide non-government money market fund boards new tools – liquidity fees and redemption gates – to address runs."&lt;ref name="SEC press release"/&gt; In August 2014, the Internal Revenue Service created a simplified aggregate method of accounting for investors in floating NAV money market funds.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.irs.gov/irb/2014-33_IRB/ar13.html Internal Revenue Bulletin: 2014-33]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' helps determine whether the early withdrawal penalties invoked by breaking an existing [[certificate of deposit]] (CD) will be offset by the better terms of a new CD. To say another way, which is the better investment - breaking an existing CD early and purchase a new CD, or, keep an existing CD? 

CDs are issued for a fixed period of time at a set interest rate. Redemption of a CD prior to its maturity date invokes a penalty as a reduction in the amount of accrued interest. Based on market conditions, such as higher interest rates, it may be beneficial to redeem an existing CD early (known as "breaking" the CD) in order to pursue a more attractive alternative.

==Redeeming a CD prior to its maturity date==

When you cash in or redeem your CD at maturity, you receive the money you originally invested plus any accrued interest. 

CD issuers protect against this practice by penalizing owners with an [[Certificate of deposit#Early withdrawal penalty | early withdrawal penalty]], in which a portion of the interest earned is forfeited. The CD issuer sets the penalty terms and conditions.&lt;ref group="note"&gt; Some credit unions do NOT give interest credit to the day of early withdrawal, but only to the last POSTED interest amount. So, for example, if you have a CD (certificate) at a credit union that posts interest calendar quarterly (end of March, June, September and December) and you withdraw early on, say, September 29 - you MIGHT lose the accrued, but unposted, interest from July 1 - September 29 AND be assessed the penalty as well. See: [https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=2671513#p2671513 Re: Question on breaking a CD], forum discussion.&lt;/ref&gt;

By forfeiting interest, the CD's value is "rolled back in time" so that the owner receives original investment plus accrued interest up to the point in time where the penalty was imposed. For example, a 3 year CD with a 6 month penalty is redeemed after 2 years (24 months). The accrued interest will only be paid up to:
:18 months accrued interest= 24 months accrued interest at time of redemption - 6 month penalty

Since the CD was held for 2 years, the total accrued interest is spread over 2 years; thereby resulting in a lowered effective yield.

A '''CD comparison''' spreadsheet is available for download [[#Spreadsheet overview | below]].

==Compounding period==
The time period used to calculate interest is important. Differences between compounding periods; such as daily, weekly or monthly, will affect results.

In the manner of the [[Bond pricing#Day count conventions | day count conventions]] used for bonds, the CD spreadsheet defines the compounding time period (N) as:
*365 days per year, which does not account for leap years&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Some credit unions ''may'' pay interest on the 366th day. See: [https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=2671513#p2671513 Re: Question on breaking a CD], forum discussion.&lt;/ref&gt;
*One month = 30.41666 days per month (30.41666 = 365 days per year / 12 months per year)

Since the compounding period is already normalized to 365 days/year, conversion to APY is implied. There's no need to use the EFFECT() formula as shown below.

==Effective yield==
Building on the concepts in [[Comparing investments | comparing investments]], Excel (or [http://www.libreoffice.org/discover/calc/ LibreOffice Calc]) can be used find the new effective yield. This provides an easy way to compare results with other CDs or investments.

The calculations are done in two steps:
*Find the CD's value, original investment and accrued interest, at the penalized time of redemption
*Find the new interest rate at the time of redemption (with no penalty)

Example: A $100 3-year CD with an APY&lt;ref&gt;APY -[http://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/apy.asp Annual Percentage Yield]&lt;/ref&gt; of 4.56 % and a 6 month penalty is redeemed after 2 years. Find the new APY.

First, define the financial variables and cash flow. Be careful to use the same units and compounding periods.

#I = 4.56% APY, which will be converted to a [[Comparing investments#Periodic interest rate | nominal rate]]
#N = 18 (18 = 24 - 6, with penalty imposed), the compounding period in months
#PMT = 0 
#FV = (solve for this)
#PV = -100 (sign is negative because money flows out of our hand)

Set Type = 0 (end of period payments).


::{| style="margin:1em auto 1em auto;" cellpadding= "3" border="1" style="border:1px solid black; border-collapse: collapse;"
|align = "right"|Initial Investment (PV):
|align = "center"|$100
|-
|align = "right"|Term:
|align = "center"|36 months
|-
|align = "right"|Interest Rate (APY):
|align = "center"|4.56 %
|-
|align = "right"|Redemption at:
|align = "center"|24 months
|-
|align = "right"|Penalty:
|align = "center"|6 months
|-
|align = "right"|Compounded:
|align = "center"|monthly
|}


There are two methods of determining the interest penalty. Simple interest or compounded interest. 

===Compound interest penalty===

From the above information, convert the APY to a monthly rate (I) and find the CD's value (FV) at the penalized redemption time of 18 months (N).

::{| style="margin:1em auto 1em auto;" cellpadding= "3" border="1" style="border:1px solid black; border-collapse: collapse;"
|align = "center"|'''Description'''
|align = "center"|'''Result'''
|align = "center"|'''Formula'''
|-
|align = "right"|Nominal Rate (I):
|align = "center"|0.372%
|align = "left"|=NOMINAL(4.56%,12)/12
|-
|align = "right"|Future Value:
|align = "center"|$106.912
|align = "left"|=FV(0.372%,'''18''',0,-100)
|}


Then, find the interest rate (I) using the actual redemption time (N = 24); this spreads the accrued interest over the full time the CD was held. Then, convert to APY.

::{| style="margin:1em auto 1em auto;" cellpadding= "3" border="1" style="border:1px solid black; border-collapse: collapse;"
|align = "center"|'''Description'''
|align = "center"|'''Result'''
|align = "center"|'''Formula'''
|-
|align = "right"|New Interest Rate (I):
|align = "center"|0.279%
|align = "left"|=RATE('''24''',0,-100,106.912)
|-
|align = "right"|New APY:
|align = "center"|3.40%
|align = "left"|=EFFECT(0.279%*12,12)
|}


Note that the CD's investment value or length of term is not needed to calculate the final yield. However, a value is needed for the interim calculations.

===Simple interest penalty===
Instead of rolling back the CD over time with the compounding formula (FV), the penalty is calculated using simple interest:
*Find the CD's value at the time of redemption
*Subtract the interest penalty, which is the (interest rate per period) * (number of periods). For example:
**CD's penalized value = Value at redemption - (Value at redemption * (interest rate per month) * (number of months penalized))
*Find the interest rate (APY) at the time of redemption

::{| style="margin:1em auto 1em auto;" cellpadding= "3" border="1" style="border:1px solid black; border-collapse: collapse;"
|align = "center"|'''Description'''
|align = "center"|'''Result'''
|align = "center"|'''Formula'''
|-
|align = "right"|Nominal Rate (I):
|align = "center"|0.372%
|align = "left"|=NOMINAL(4.56%,12)/12
|-
|align = "right"|Future Value:
|align = "center"|$107.089
|align = "left"|=FV(0.372%,'''24''',0,-100) - 100*'''6'''*0.372%
|}


As before, find the interest rate (I) using the actual redemption time (N = 24); this spreads the accrued interest over the full time the CD was held. Then, convert to APY.

::{| style="margin:1em auto 1em auto;" cellpadding= "3" border="1" style="border:1px solid black; border-collapse: collapse;"
|align = "center"|'''Description'''
|align = "center"|'''Result'''
|align = "center"|'''Formula'''
|-
|align = "right"|New Interest Rate (I):
|align = "center"|0.286%
|align = "left"|=RATE('''24''',0,-100,107.089)
|-
|align = "right"|New APY:
|align = "center"|3.49%
|align = "left"|=EFFECT(0.286%*12,12)
|}

==Spreadsheet overview==
The spreadsheet, downloaded [[#External links | below]], uses the above equations in a more compact form. Just enter basic information and the spreadsheet goes to work. Compare results in either years or months. Put an "x" in the ''Simple Interest Penalty'' cell if the penalty is simple interest, otherwise compound interest is used.

As the equations are configured, the initial investment is not needed. A value of $1 is used for the interim calculations. If the actual value over time is desired, click on the "Future Value" tab.

If you have a sizable taxable account, it is possible to '''place a cash needs requirement''', such as an [[Emergency fund | emergency fund]] or home down payment, '''in a tax-advantaged account''' and improve the overall tax efficiency of an investment portfolio.

{{Notice|
Placing emergency funds in volatile accounts can be risky. Consider that the stock market may drop 50% when you need the money the most, forcing you to withdraw from the tax-advantaged account.&lt;ref&gt;{{forum link| t=65387| title=Emergency funds| date=December 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the taxable account should be twice as large as your cash needs. If it is smaller, keep a proportional portion of your cash needs in cash.
}}

==How it works==

Suppose you have $15,000 in your portfolio with additional $5,000 as an emergency fund. Then you could have:

* Taxable&lt;br&gt;$10,000 tax-efficient stock index funds
* Tax-advantaged account, such as [[401(k)]]&lt;br&gt;$5,000 money market fund (your emergency fund)&lt;br&gt;$5,000 bond fund

Now, suppose you need $5,000 in an emergency. You sell $5,000 from the stock index funds in your taxable account and exchange the money market fund for similar stock funds in your tax-advantaged account. You are left with:

* Taxable&lt;br&gt;$5,000 tax-efficient stock index funds
* Tax-advantaged account, such as 401(k)&lt;br&gt;$5,000 stock funds&lt;br&gt;$5,000 bond fund

Notice that you have not changed the asset allocation at all.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;
''White Coat Investor'' commented in this {{Forum link| p=2686420| title=Buying a house in 2-4 years; what do I do with my mutual funds?}} on the transfer from an existing investment in equity to a safer option for a house down payment:
{{blockquote|The main thing is to consider your options in the event of a huge bear market. If the market drops 50%, what will you do? Here are some choices:

# Don't buy the house and just keep renting until the stocks recover and future savings gets you back to where you want to be.
# Maybe houses will be cheaper in an economic downturn and you can still buy it with your decreased amount.
# Maybe houses will be cheaper and you can use a mortgage with &lt; 20% down, leaving your investments intact.
# Maybe you won't buy a house at all.

For some people, for whom these options aren't good choices, should sell their stocks now and put the money in CDs. But there are many people for whom these other options are very realistic alternatives. For them, keeping some or all of the money in stocks is probably okay. The expected return is higher, even if the actual return may not be.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Why it works==
 
The tax efficiency of holding your cash needs in a tax-advantaged account comes in two forms.

===While you do not need the cash===
While you do not need the cash, tax-efficient stock index funds generally yield 2% or so, which are all or mostly qualified dividends; most of the return is from capital gains which are not taxed until you sell. Depending on the interest rate, a typical money market fund yields anywhere from 2% to 5%, and the dividends are all non-qualified dividends. In addition, you can [[Tax loss harvesting | tax loss harvest]] the stock funds.

===When you need the cash===
When you sell a part of the tax-efficient stock index funds, you realize either losses or long-term capital gains. You can deduct losses on your tax return after offsetting capital gains, if any. Long-term capital gains are taxed more favorably than non-qualified dividends.

==Candidates for tax-efficient stock index funds==
The following funds are good candidates in which to invest cash needs, but there are others that are just as good.

US Domestic:
* Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund
* Vanguard Large-Cap Index Fund

International:
* Vanguard Total International Stock Market Index Fund
* Vanguard FTSE All-World ex-US Index Fund

The [[Principles of tax-efficient fund placement]] article prefers placing international stocks in the taxable account. Each pair is suitable for [[Tax loss harvesting | tax loss harvesting]] and avoiding [[wash sale | wash sales]].

==Fine points==

Use [[Specific identification of shares]]. Sell tax lots with losses or tax lots with the highest cost basis that have long-term capital gains. If you do not use [[Specific identification of shares]], it is difficult to minimize tax. In some cases, you might pay more tax on short-term capital gains than on ordinary income, which negates the benefit of placing cash needs in a tax-advantaged account. For this reason, you may want to wait for twelve months before you place cash needs in a tax-advantaged account if you are starting a taxable account now.

Avoid a [[wash sale]]. If you sell shares of the tax-efficient stock index funds with losses and buy "substantially identical" securities in your tax-advantaged account (within 30 days before or after the sale), that is a wash sale. You cannot deduct losses at all in this case. Therefore, you need to find a fund which is not substantially identical to purchase in your tax-advantaged account; preferably, it should be similar, such as an active fund in the same asset class as the index, or a fund tracking a different index. If you prefer to hold the original fund in your tax-advantaged account, you may switch after 31 days.

Make sure your taxable account is large enough. Keep in mind that the stock market tanking by 50% is not uncommon. If your taxable account is not large enough, say twice as large as the cash needs, then you may not have enough money in your taxable account during a market downturn. The market could actually go down by '''more''' than 50%, and that is a risk of this technique if the taxable account does not provide enough cushion. For this reason, you may be able to keep a small amount of cash needs (for example, enough for an emergency) in tax-efficient stock index funds, but you may not want to keep a large amount of cash needs (for example, a home down payment fund) in such potentially volatile investments, unless you have a very large taxable retirement portfolio.

These are Vanguard's three broad international index funds. Any of the three is a good core international holding, and all are eligible for the [[foreign tax credit]], should have very low capital gains, making them suitable for taxable accounts. You might also add Vanguard Emerging Markets Index Fund if you hold Developed Markets Index (or a non-Vanguard international fund) which has no emerging markets.

==Region breakdown==
As of 2025, the regional breakdown for three Vanguard international funds is shown below.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' addresses the most Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) regarding Vanguard small cap funds.

==Basic questions==

===How many small cap funds does Vanguard provide?===
Vanguard currently provides seventeen non-institutional small cap funds:

===What percentage of the total stock market do small caps represent?===

About 10% small caps would equal the weighting of the total stock market. International small cap would also require about 10% to complete the FTSE All World ex. U. S. index. Note that whereas the Vanguard U. S. Total stock market and Total International index funds contain the market weight in small caps, the FTSE Index, holding large and mid cap stocks, does not.

===Are small cap funds necessary in my portfolio?===
If you want to hold small cap allocations at [[Market capitalization |market capitalization]] weightings you can hold a US Total Market Index fund and meet your allocation needs without adding a small cap fund. However, if your [[FAQ small cap funds#My company plan does not have a small cap fund, how can I add one? | employer provided retirement plan]] provides you with an S&amp;P 500 index fund and no other low cost options you may wish to add a small cap fund in your taxable account or personal retirement plan in order to mirror the market. (See [[Approximating total stock market]] for guidance).

You would also want to add a small cap fund to your portfolio if you want to [[FAQ small cap funds#What is "tilting" to small mean and how much should I tilt? | "tilt" ]] your portfolio asset allocation towards higher small cap and/or value weightings than those provided by market cap weighting.

Currently, the Vanguard Total International index fund is the only Vanguard international index fund allocating market weights to international small cap stocks. If you hold any of the other Vanguard international index funds, you might want to add a small cap international index fund to your portfolio. (See [[Vanguard FTSE All-World ex-US Small-Cap Index Fund]] which suggests holding this fund in a 1:9 ratio with the FTSE-All-World ex-US index for market cap weighting. The combination of these two funds is a sensible choice if you want total market weighting, as the funds track exactly complementary indexes. Additional international small cap options are available at [[International small cap]]).

===What are the expected returns of the different funds?=== 
According to [[Historical and expected returns |30 year return ''estimates'']] from [[William Bernstein]] and [[Rick Ferri]] small cap stocks can be expected to provide the following returns:{{#tag:ref|Sources: Portfolios Solutions LLC (2006).

Vanguard index funds can be expected to provide the market return, less expenses and transaction costs. Vanguard active funds offer the hope of providing excess returns to the market, at the risk of providing less than market returns.

===What does "tilting" to small mean and how much should I tilt?=== 
{{Quote
|quote = '''John Bogle on tilting''':&lt;br&gt;"Impressed both by the long-term performance (and recent performance) of value stocks and small-cap stocks, some investors hold the all-market (or S&amp;P 500) index fund as the core, and add a value index fund and a small-cap index fund as satellites. I'm skeptical that any kind of superior performance will endure forever. (Nothing does!) But if you disagree, it would not be unreasonable to hold, say, 85 percent in the core, another 10 percent in value, and another 5 percent in small cap. But doing so increases the risk that your return will fall short of the market's return, so don't push too far."

Financial experts&lt;ref&gt;See John Bogle, [https://personal.vanguard.com/bogle_site/sp20020626.html The Telltale Chart]&lt;/ref&gt; often recommend that investors should use index mutual funds to invest in entire markets, or, invest in funds that approximate the total market. Other portfolio theorists advise holding portfolios that tilt toward small and value stocks.&lt;ref&gt;Eugene Fama Jr., [http://www.dfaus.com/2009/05/the-new-indexing.html The New Indexing], July 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Truman A. Clark, [http://www.dfaus.com/2009/05/the-dimensions-of-stock-returns-2007.html The Dimensions of Stock Returns], September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In general, the stock market is composed of 3 levels of [[Market capitalization | market capitalization]] and 3 [[Stock basics#Style | styles]], resulting in a 3 x 3 "style" box. For example, this Total Stock Market Index fund style box (numbers shown are percentages):

{{MStarStylebox|12 | 25 | 34| 6 | 9 | 5 | 3 | 3 | 2}}

As defined in the style box for VTSMX,&lt;ref&gt;[{{vf|0085}} Vanguard's Total Stock Market Index Fund (VTSMX)] approximates the total market by investing in over 3,000 stocks, which is representative of the whole U.S. market&lt;/ref&gt; the majority of the US Market (the Total Stock Market or "TSM") is held in large caps. Therefore, this fund (representing the US Market, or the "Market") is defined as a "''cap weighted''" market.

[[Image:CoffeeHouse_Portfolio.PNG|thumb|200px| Bill Shultheis' Coffeehouse Portfolio, employing 4x25 value and small cap tilts]]

The intent is that these distribution percentages, by definition, accurately represent the composition of the entire market. Gain and loss over time represents the movement of the market as a whole.

If you invest $1.00 in a total market index fund, each stock receives the same amount of your dollar in proportion to its cap weight. The largest stock gets 100 times the amount of a company 100th its size. Therefore, no company gets more or less than that determined by its market capitalization. 

The Small cap styles represent 8% (3 + 3 + 2) of the total market. ''Tilting to Small'' means overweighting your portfolio to hold more than 8% of Small cap stocks. 

Historically, value stocks and small stocks have provided higher returns than large blend and growth stocks (in both domestic and foreign markets). The theoretical basis posited for these higher returns states that small stocks and value stocks are riskier than large and growth stocks, and that the higher returns compensate investors for higher risk.&lt;ref&gt; Rolf W. Banz, "The Relationship Between Return and Market Value of Common Stocks," Journal of Financial Economics, 9 (1981), pp. 3-18 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Davis, James L., [[Fama%2C_Eugene_F.]] and [[French%2C_Kenneth_R.]], "Characteristics, Covariances, and Average Returns: 1929-1997" (February 1999). Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP) Working Paper No. 471. Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=98678 or DOI: 10.2139/ssrn.98678 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Fama%2C_Eugene_F.]] and [[French%2C_Kenneth_R.]], "Value Versus Growth: The International Evidence" (August 1997). Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=2358 or DOI: 10.2139/ssrn.2358 &lt;/ref&gt; Based on theory and past performance, some investors choose to add additional value and small stocks to their portfolios. Many investors who tilt employ what is termed a 4x25 allocation consisting of equal parts of 25% large blend; 25% large value; 25% small blend; and 25% small value. Tilters employ blend indexes for growth stock exposure in response to the long term performance of small cap growth stocks.&lt;ref&gt; [[William Bernstein]], [http://www.efficientfrontier.com/ef/499/scg.htm Small Cap Growth Indexing and the Multifactor Threestep],''Efficient Frontier'', April, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; [[William Bernstein]], [http://www.efficientfrontier.com/ef/701/sg.htm The Small-Growth Indexing Anomaly], ''Efficient Frontier'', Summer 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Other tilters, valuing greater portfolio simplicity, overweight small value stocks by adding a small value fund to the market portfolio (see John Bogle on tilting in the sidebox quote).&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Sample portfolios using small cap tilts are included in [[Lazy portfolios]]:
*[[Lazy portfolios#Bill Schultheis's "Coffeehouse" Portfolio]]
*[[Lazy portfolios#William Bernstein's "Coward's" Portfolio]]
*[[Lazy portfolios#Frank Armstrong's "Ideal Index" Portfolio]]&lt;/ref&gt; Overweight means increasing your holdings to more than is naturally in the market profile. 

====Considerations====
*In some cases (higher expected returns), tilting can allow the investor to add more fixed-income securities (bonds) and less equity to the total portfolio.
*The investor's behavior during bear and bull markets can influence results. An investor who tilts must be able to hold to the allocation during periods when the tilted equity portfolio under performs the market portfolio. An investor should also resist the temptation to engage in "performance chasing", that is buying or selling a size or style tilt based on recent performance. 
*Tilted portfolios require long holding periods as the market, value, and size factor returns often rotate over time.&lt;ref&gt; [[William Bernstein]], [http://www.efficientfrontier.com/ef/700/factors.htm Factor Rotation], ''Efficient Frontier'', Summer 2000. &lt;/ref&gt;
*Although small and value stocks have higher expected returns than growth stocks, investors should recognize that the record of realized returns does not assure a similar pattern in the future. The timing and magnitude of the size and value premiums will always be uncertain, i.e. past performance does not predict future performance.

===My company plan does not have a small cap fund, how can I add one?=== 
If you would like to invest in a small cap fund outside of your company plan you can place the investment in either your personal retirement plan ([[Traditional IRA]] or [[Roth IRA]]) or in your taxable account. (For guidance on asset location considerations refer to [[Principles of tax-efficient fund placement]]).

===How tax-efficient are the small cap funds?=== 
Actively managed small cap funds are not very tax efficient. Active funds tend to distribute hefty capital gains distributions. Vanguard small cap index funds are currently very tax efficient as a result of the following three factors:
# The benchmarking of the funds to [[CRSP equity indexes|CRSP]] and[[:Category:FTSE indexes | FTSE indexes]] which use transition bands between size and valuation metrics. These bands tend to reduce the turnover of stocks as they migrate across indexes, which helps reduce taxable gain realization.
# The accumulation of realized loss carryforwards from the 2000-2002 and 2008 bear markets. These carryforwards were applied to offset future realized gains in the funds through fiscal year 2017. Active small cap funds tend to realize gains at a much quicker rate than do index funds. This tendency results in active funds depleting loss carryforwards much faster than index funds.
# The ETF share classes of Vanguard index funds, through the institutional creation and redemption process of [[ETF]] shares, serve to enhance the funds' tax efficiency by gradually removing low basis stock from the fund portfolios and by stabilizing the funds' level of loss carryforwards.

Under current law, [[Qualified dividend | qualified dividends]] are taxed at lower capital gains tax rates. The qualified dividends a small cap index fund passes on to shareholders is reduced by the holding periods of a fund's purchases and sales of stocks and by the extent of a fund's holding of [[REIT]]s, whose dividends are unqualified.
Small cap value index funds provide higher dividend payouts than do small growth or small blend indexes.

The [[Vanguard FTSE All-World ex-US Small-Cap Index Fund]], like a majority of [[International small cap#tax efficiency|international small cap funds and ETFs]], has distributed a small capital gain early in its history. The fund's passive management approach and ETF share class structure should result in improved tax efficiency over the long term. The fund also qualifies for the [[foreign tax credit]] for taxable investors.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' shows how you can combine funds to mimic the composition of the international stock market. Funds can be [[mutual fund]]s, [[index fund]]s or [[exchange-traded fund]]s (ETFs).

Investors who want to invest in the Vanguard Total International Stock Market Index Fund often face a situation where they have to approximate it with the funds available in their employer sponsored plans, perhaps also using funds in other accounts, for example a [[Roth IRA]]. [[Thrift Savings Plan]] investors, for example, face this issue with the [[I Fund]] (based on [[MSCI EAFE index]]), which lacks [[Emerging market stocks|emerging markets]], [[International Small-Cap|small-cap]] stocks, and Canadian stocks.

==Total international stock market index==
This table shows Total International Stock Market Index Funds from two providers. The aim is to approximate these [[Approximating total stock market#Stock market classifications| stock style boxes]] using available funds chosen from the two-fund and EAFE tables below.

The [[MSCI EAFE index]] does not include:
* [[Emerging market stocks|Emerging markets]]
* [[International small cap|International small-caps]]
* Canadian stocks

You may want to use one of the two boxes depending on whether you have access to an [[MSCI]] or [[FTSE Emerging Index|FTSE]] emerging markets index fund. MSCI classifies South Korea as an emerging market, while FTSE considers it a developed market&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ftserussell.com/blogs/south-korea-developed-or-emerging |title= South Korea: Developed or Emerging?|publisher= FTSE Russell|date= February 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;; this is why box 2 uses a separate South Korea index fund. 

The blended [[expense ratio]]s of the two boxes are 0.10% and 0.12% respectively, assuming that the [https://www.tsp.gov/funds-individual/i-fund/?tab=fees I Fund (0.055%)] takes the place of the MSCI EAFE index fund. You can reduce the expense ratios by using the [https://www.franklintempleton.com/investor/investments-and-solutions/investment-options/etfs/overview/26364/franklin-ftse-canada-etf/FLCA Franklin FTSE Canada ETF (FLCA)] (0.09%) and [https://www.franklintempleton.com/investor/investments-and-solutions/investment-options/etfs/overview/26353/franklin-ftse-south-korea-etf-/FLKR  Franklin FTSE South Korea ETF (FLKR)] (0.09%). These are smaller and more lightly traded than their iShares equivalents, meaning a larger [[bid/ask spread]], but they have much lower expense ratios.

To hold the portfolio in box 1 in the recommended percentage, using the Admiral Class share of the [{{Vf | vfsax}} Vanguard FTSE All-World ex-US Small Cap Index Fund (VFSAX)], the minimum amount you would need for all four funds together is $30,000. This is because 10% of that amount equals the $3,000 fund minimum for VFSAX. Of that $30,000, at least $12,600 must be in the IRA to hold the three funds, with the remaining $17,400 in the I Fund.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;For an older version of the weightings and price calculation, see the [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AueLhNpKZa4XdDdDVEFiZlJKWHlEUFJFVzJBaVlqakE Vanguard Total International Stock Market replication with I Fund] Google Spreadsheet.&lt;/ref&gt; You can avoid this by owning ETF share classes of the Vanguard FTSE All-World ex-US Small Cap Index.

==Canadian investors==

For Canadians, most [[finiki:Registered Retirement Savings Plan|Registered Retirement Savings Plans]] have a brokerage function that let you purchase of securities based in the United States. Consider investing in '''[{{Vf | 3141}} Vanguard Total World Stock Index ETF]''' which samples securities from throughout the entire investable world market. You could then use '''[https://www.vanguardcanada.ca/individual/etfs/etfs-detail-overview.htm?portId=9554 Vanguard MSCI Canada Index ETF]''' and '''[http://ca.ishares.com/product_info/fund/overview/XMD.htm iShares S&amp;P/TSX Completion Index Fund]''' to balance to your desired domestic exposure.

== Methodology ==

All the above collections of funds were weighted in a manner to approximate the Morningstar Style Box, average market cap, and [[#Region and sector comparison|industry and regional weightings]] of the [{{Vf | vxus}} Vanguard Total International Stock ETF (VXUS) (0.08%)].&lt;ref name="Xray" /&gt;

The collection of funds making up the first box in the EAFE table is weighted in the following way:

* '''Small-cap stocks''' are weighted at 10% per [[Vanguard_FTSE_All-World_ex-US_Small-Cap_Index_Fund#Total_Market_Replication|Vanguard FTSE All-World ex-US Small-Cap Index]].
* '''Canadian stocks''' are 6.6% of Vanguard's Total International Stock ETF&lt;ref name="VXUS Portfolio"&gt;{{cite web |url={{Vf | vxus}} |title=Vanguard Total International Stock ETF (VXUS) Portfolio &amp; Management |publisher=Vanguard |date=April 30, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 14.8% of Vanguard's FTSE All-World ex-US Small Cap ETF.&lt;ref name="VSS Portfolio"&gt;{{cite web |url={{Vf | vss}} |title=Vanguard FTSE All-World ex-US Small-Cap ETF (VSS) Portfolio &amp; Management |publisher=Vanguard |date=April 30, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given that Vanguard's international small cap fund overlaps the total international market fund, it was decided to weight the Canadian MSCI fund at 5% of the overall collection of funds (which is 6.6% - (14.8% * 10%)).
* '''Emerging markets''' (per MSCI) are 29.6% of Vanguard's Total International Stock ETF,{{#tag:ref|29.6% = 25.5% FTSE emerging markets + 4.1% South Korea.&lt;ref name="VXUS Portfolio"/&gt;|group=note}} and are 28.3% of the Vanguard FTSE All-World ex-US Small-Cap ETF.{{#tag:ref|28.3% = 23.4% FTSE emerging markets + 4.9% South Korea.&lt;ref name="VSS Portfolio" /&gt;|group=note}} Given that these funds overlap, the MSCI Emerging Markets ETF was weighted at 27% (which is 29.6% - (28.3% * 10%)).
* '''Europe, Australasia, and the Far East (EAFE)''' is everything left over, which is 58%. The '''MSCI EAFE index fund''' is a proxy for the I Fund, Schwab International Index Fund (SWISX) or any MSCI EAFE fund.

== Region and sector comparison ==

When Vanguard's International Total Stock ETF and the collection of funds were compared in Morningstar's X-Ray's different measurements, both were similar. For example, X-Ray compared the geographic regions as (rounded to the nearest 1%):

An '''emerging market''' is defined as an economy that is progressing towards standards of market liquidity, transparency, accounting regularity, and securities regulation which are standard features of what are termed "developed markets."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/emergingmarketeconomy.asp| title=Emerging Market Economy Definition, How It Works, and Examples| publisher=Investopedia| accessdate=May 26, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term 'emerging market' dates from 1981 when Antoine W. Van Antmael, an official of the International Finance Corporation of the World Bank, first coined the term. Emerging market economies encompass nearly 80% of the world's population and make up 20% of its economies.{{citation needed}}

The map figures (Figure 1 and Figure 2) show nations considered to be emerging markets. 

In 1992, Farida Khambata, an official at the International Finance Corporation, coined the term ''"[[Frontier market stocks|frontier markets]]"'' for nations with smaller market capitalization and less liquidity than nations classified as emerging markets.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikipedia:Frontier markets|Frontier markets]], Wikipedia&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time, national markets can migrate from the continuum of classifications, moving between developed, emerging, and frontier markets. Argentina is an example of this migration. At the start of the twentieth century, Argentina was the seventh largest developed economy in the world. By the late 1960s, as a result of inflation and interest rate policies, the Buenos Aires stock market virtually disappeared.&lt;ref name="Jorion"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://merage.uci.edu/~jorion/papers/century.pdf | author1=Philippe Jorion| author2=William N. Goetzmann| date=1999| title=Global Stock Markets in the Twentieth Century| publisher=Journal of Finance 54:953-80| page=970| url-status=live| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190220032909/https://merage.uci.edu/~jorion/papers/century.pdf| archive-date=February 20, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1980s, Argentina was considered an emerging market. In 2009 Argentina was dropped into the frontier market classification by MSCI, Russell, and S&amp;P. 

As of October 2012, emerging market stocks comprised 13.60% of the global equity market.

==Emerging market stocks==
[[File:Globalreturns.gif|thumb|500px| Figure 3. Global real returns (no dividends)&lt;ref name="Jorion" /&gt;]]

Many emerging market countries have stock markets dating back to the nineteenth century. However, reliable return data is not easily available for many markets. Current [[Indexing|index]] providers have measured returns since 1989. [[Philippe Jorion]] and [[William N. Goetzmann]] examined global stock returns during the twentieth century and published the results in their 1999 paper ''Global Stock Markets in the Twentieth Century''.&lt;ref name="Jorion" /&gt; Figure 3 presents the results of the study as a graph.

The table data provides real returns, and because dividend histories in many markets are not always available, the returns do not reflect dividends. Given that dividends in most markets averaged 4% during the twentieth century, adding 4% to the returns is a reasonable assumption for arriving at total real return.{{#tag:ref|Philippe Jorian and William Goetzmann measure returns for a global stock market index, weighted by GDP, for the period 1921 - 1996 and find an ex-dividend real return of 4.04% for the index, compared to a 4.32% ex-dividend real return for the U.S. stock market.&lt;ref name="Jorion" /&gt;|group="note"}}

Philippe Jorian and William Goetzmann also point out that the historical returns record contains selection bias, because countries contained in the indexes are the ones that have been relatively successful.

==Risk, volatility, correlation==
A Vanguard white paper, ''International equity investing: Investing in emerging markets'',&lt;ref name="Vanguard white paper"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://institutional.vanguard.com/iip/pdf/emergingmarkets.pdf| title=International Equity Investing: Investing in Emerging Markets| publisher=Vanguard Investment Counseling &amp; Research| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110917062248/https://institutional.vanguard.com/iip/pdf/emergingmarkets.pdf| archive-date=September 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; examines emerging market stock returns over the 1985 to 2005 period. The paper examines returns, risks, volatility, and asset correlations.

The paper notes that in addition to market and currency risks, emerging stock markets are especially susceptible to the following risks:

*'''Political risks'''. Political instability can result from external conflict, coups, and racial and national tensions. 
*'''Economic risks.''' Economic policies and reforms can fail.
*'''Regulatory and operational environment'''. The quality of market regulation, corporate governance, transparency, and accounting standards is often below that of developed markets.
*'''Limits on investment'''. Foreign investment may be limited or taxed. 
*'''High industry/firm concentration'''. In emerging markets, a large share of a country’s stock market capitalization may be concentrated in a particular industry or company.&lt;ref name= "Vanguard white paper" /&gt;

Between 1985 and 2005, emerging market stocks provided the following returns and [[Standard deviation|standard deviations]], a measure of volatility. Note that emerging market stocks were more volatile than both U.S. stocks and developed market stocks. Over the same period, emerging market stocks displayed an increasing correlation (rising to nearly 80%) with both U.S. and developed stock markets. Correlations between emerging market countries also increased over this time period, but remained low (rising from 5% to 35%).&lt;ref name= "Vanguard white paper"/&gt; These low correlations between national emerging markets suggest that the high risk and high volatility of single nation emerging market stock returns can be prudently mitigated by diversifying emerging market investments over a wide selection of countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author1=Christopher B. Philips| author2=Joseph H. Davis| author3=Roger Aliaga-Díaz| author4=Francis M. Kinniry Jr.| url=https://institutional.vanguard.com/VGApp/iip/site/institutional/researchcommentary/article/InvResEmergingexposure| title=Research note: Emerging markets - Individual country or broad-market exposure?| publisher=Vanguard Research &amp; Counseling| date=April 5, 2011}}{{dead link}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the MSCI emerging market index annual returns have ranged from a low of -53.33% in 2008 to +78.51% in 2009.&lt;ref group="note"&gt; The MSCI Emerging Markets Stock index annual returns:

{{Spreadsheet|key=0Ao_KSkmSuU2rdFhrdGhQcUhkcXM2cW1HeXFlR0VvaUE}}&lt;/ref&gt; This compares to the Thailand market, which provided a 113.8% return in 1993 and was followed by a combined loss of 86.7% over 1996 and 1997.

==Emerging market indexes==
Dow Jones, FTSE, Morningstar, MSCI, Russell, and S&amp;P now provide emerging market indexes. Country representation varies among providers, shown in the following table. The variation in index composition results in a dispersion of index returns.

==Emerging market index funds==

Vanguard introduced indexing emerging market stocks to retail investors on May 5, 1994. Currently, emerging market index funds are available tracking FTSE, MSCI, and S&amp;P indices.&lt;ref group="note"&gt; For a listing of available funds, refer to [https://www.altruistfa.com/emergingmktsfunds.htm Emerging Markets Funds]&lt;/ref&gt; Russell has filed with the SEC for introducing an [[Exchange Traded Funds|ETF]] based on the Russell Emerging Market Index.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1476734/000119312510075953/dn1a.htm| title=Form N-1A| publisher=SEC| accessdate=May 26, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emerging market style index funds are available in the small cap style class.&lt;ref group="note"&gt; Refer to [https://www.altruistfa.com/emergingmktssmall%20funds.htm Emerging Markets Small Cap Funds] for a listing of available options.&lt;/ref&gt; Indexing emerging market stocks is a prudent strategy, given that indexing has consistently outperformed the majority of active funds, as Figure 4 illustrates.{{#tag:ref|SPIVA also finds the S&amp;P/IFCI Composite emerging market index out performing active funds over one, three, and five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/documents/spiva/spiva-us-yearend2011.pdf| title=S&amp;P Year-End 2011 Scorecard| publisher=S&amp;P Dow Jones}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group="note"}}

==Suggested asset allocation==
{{See also|Lazy portfolios|Three-fund portfolio}}
Investors wanting to include emerging markets in a portfolio might consider the following.

*Investors wanting to hold a market [[Asset allocation|allocation]] of stocks might consider holding a global stock market index fund, which would hold market weights of domestic market, developed market and emerging market stocks.
*Investors wanting to hold specific weights of domestic and international stocks, and wanting to hold a market weighting of developed market and emerging market stocks in the international allocation might consider holding a total international index fund.
* Vanguard suggests that investors should allocate between 10% to 15% of the international allocation to emerging market stocks.&lt;ref name= "Vanguard white paper"/&gt;
* In his book ''[[All About Asset Allocation]]'', [[Rick Ferri]] suggests that investors using multiple asset class portfolios should hold [[Slice and dice international|equal weights]] of international indexes: a European stock index fund, a Pacific stock index fund, an emerging markets stock index fund, and a small cap international index fund.

Because US large-cap stocks and international large-cap stocks have high correlation, some investors look for '''international small cap''' [[Mutual fund|mutual funds]] and [[Exchange-traded funds|ETFs]] to further diversify their portfolios. This page is intended to present a summary of international small cap mutual funds and ETFs. 

==Selection==
New ETFs open regularly, so this list is not complete. It includes the major ETFs and mutual funds, but excludes those which are unlikely to be of interest to most investors because they are only available through advisors, very expensive, or very small and so expensive to trade.

==Caution==

===Tracking error===

Because these ETFs trade in illiquid stocks, many of them only sample the indexes they track, and they incur transaction costs when the indexes change. Therefore, the ETFs do not necessarily track the index well; deviations of 1% annually are common. EWX underperformed its index by about 3% annually through 2012, was close in 2013-2015, outperformed the index in 2016-2018, and underperformed again in 2020 and 2023-2024. (This tracking error is based on the [[Net asset value|net asset value]]; when you buy or sell an ETF, this may add to the tracking error because these ETFs frequently trade at a premium or discount to net asset value.)

===Tax efficiency===

Vanguard International Explorer Fund has been very tax inefficient, and since it is actively managed and is not an ETF, it is likely to remain tax-inefficient, You should strongly consider holding it in a tax-advantaged account. Similarly, Schwab Fundamental Small Company Index Fund and Avantis International Small Cap-Value Fund have distributed some capital gains, and are likely to distribute more because of fund turnover; in a taxable account, use the analogous ETFs FNDC and AVDV instead. (Even though AVDV is an actively managed ETF, the ETF structure makes it less likely to distribute capital gains, and it has never distributed any.)

Small-cap international ETFs tend to distribute more capital gains than other ETFs, possibly because there is less creation/redemption activity. Some foreign countries, particularly emerging markets, do not allow in-kind redemptions, eliminating the tax benefit from the redemption process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/investment-products/etf/etfs-tax-efficiency| title=ETFs versus Mutual Funds, Tax Efficiency| publisher=Fidelity| accessdate=May 26, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt; Small-cap ETFs should be less likely to distribute gains after several years of operation, because the redemption process is more effective at reducing gains when shares have been purchased at a wide range of prices. As of 2024, only the SPDR ETFs GWX and EWX have distributed gains after the second year, and none have distributed a gain since 2015.

GWX has has the largest distributions; it distributed a 1.5% short-term gain in its first year (2007), an 0.8% long-term gain in 2011, a 2.7% short-term and 7.5% long-term gain in 2014, an 0.5% short-term and trivial long-term gain in 2015, an 0.8% short-term and 0.5% long-term gain in 2016, and a 2.0% short-term and 0.9% long-term gain in 2019. EWX distributed a 1.5% short-term gain in its second year (2009), a 2.1% short-term and 0.5% long-term gain in 2010, and a 1.3% short-term and 2.2% long-term gain in 2011. VSS distributed a 0.7% short-term gain in its first year (2009) and 0.4% short-term and 0.4% long-term in its second year (2010). DLS distributed an 0.8% short-term gain in its second year (2007). 

Independent of capital gains, DLS and DGS are likely to have higher tax costs than the other ETFs, because their indexes overweight stocks with a higher dividend yield.  The other value ETFs are factor-based, not dividend-based, and tend not to have a higher dividend yield than blend ETFs.

===Trading costs===

Many of the ETFs above are thinly traded, and even those which have fairly high volume have larger-than-average [[bid/ask spread]] because the value of the underlying stocks is more difficult to estimate.

===Underlying securities===

The products above have quite different sets and weights of underlying securities. Because of different definitions of developed and emerging markets, two indexes in the same market segment may have different country holdings. Even within the same countries, market-cap-weighted indexes have different country weights because of different definitions of small-cap by country. Be sure to read the prospectus of each product and, if necessary, do additional research before investing in any of the products above.

The concept of portfolio '''value tilting''' is intended for &lt;u&gt;advanced investors&lt;/u&gt;. Tilting is not recommended for new investors, as it ''intentionally deviates'' from investing in the total market- a Bogleheads' approach to managing your portfolio.
}}

==Background==
{{Quote
|quote = '''John Bogle on tilting''':&lt;br&gt;"Impressed both by the long-term performance (and recent performance) of value stocks and small-cap stocks, some investors hold the all-market (or S&amp;P 500) index fund as the core, and add a value index fund and a small-cap index fund as satellites. I'm skeptical that any kind of superior performance will endure forever. (Nothing does!) But if you disagree, it would not be unreasonable to hold, say, 85 percent in the core, another 10 percent in value, and another 5 percent in small cap. But doing so increases the risk that your return will fall short of the market's return, so don't push too far."

Financial experts&lt;ref&gt;See John Bogle, [https://personal.vanguard.com/bogle_site/sp20020626.html The Telltale Chart]&lt;/ref&gt; often recommend that investors should use index mutual funds to invest in entire markets, or, invest in funds that approximate the total market. Other portfolio theorists advise holding portfolios that tilt toward small and value stocks.&lt;ref&gt;Eugene Fama Jr., [http://www.dfaus.com/2009/05/the-new-indexing.html The New Indexing], July 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Truman A. Clark, [http://www.dfaus.com/2009/05/the-dimensions-of-stock-returns-2007.html The Dimensions of Stock Returns], September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; 
One popular way to analyze the stock market is to subdivide it into 3 levels of [[Market Capitalization | market capitalization]] and 3 [[Stock Basics#Style | styles]], resulting in a 3 x 3 "style" box. As defined in the style box for VTSMX&lt;ref&gt;[{{Vf | 0085}} Vanguard's Total Stock Market Index Fund (VTSMX)] approximates the total market by investing in over 3,000 stocks, which is representative of the whole U.S. market&lt;/ref&gt;, the majority of the US Market (the Total Stock Market or "TSM") is held in large caps. Therefore, this fund (representing the US Market, or the "Market") is defined as a "''cap weighted''" market.

The intent is that these distribution percentages, by definition, accurately represent the composition of the entire market. Gain and loss over time represents the movement of the market as a whole.

If you invest $1.00 in a total market index fund, each stock receives the same amount of your dollar in proportion to its cap weight. The largest stock gets 100 times the amount of a company 100th its size. Therefore, no company gets more or less than that determined by its market capitalization.

==Tilting==
Tilting is defined as any deviation (change) from the Total Stock Market distribution percentages as previously defined.

Historically, value stocks and small stocks have provided higher returns than large blend and growth stocks (in both domestic and foreign markets). The theoretical basis posited for these higher returns states that small stocks and value stocks are riskier than large and growth stocks, and that the higher returns compensate investors for higher risk.&lt;ref&gt; Rolf W. Banz, "The Relationship Between Return and Market Value of Common Stocks," Journal of Financial Economics, 9 (1981), pp. 3-18 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Davis, James L., [[Eugene F. Fama]] and [[Kenneth R. French]], "Characteristics, Covariances, and Average Returns: 1929-1997" (February 1999). Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP) Working Paper No. 471. Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=98678 or DOI: 10.2139/ssrn.98678 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Eugene F. Fama]] and [[Kenneth R. French]], "Value Versus Growth: The International Evidence" (August 1997). Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=2358 or DOI: 10.2139/ssrn.2358 &lt;/ref&gt; Based on theory and past performance, some investors choose to add additional value and small stocks to their portfolios. Many investors who tilt employ what is termed a 4x25 allocation consisting of equal parts of 25% large blend; 25% large value; 25% small blend; and 25% small value. Tilters employ blend indexes for growth stock exposure in response to the long term performance of small cap growth stocks.&lt;ref&gt; [[William Bernstein]], [http://www.efficientfrontier.com/ef/499/scg.htm Small Cap Growth Indexing and the Multifactor Threestep],''Efficient Frontier'', April, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; [[William Bernstein]], [http://www.efficientfrontier.com/ef/701/sg.htm The Small-Growth Indexing Anomaly], ''Efficient Frontier'', Summer 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Other tilters, valuing greater portfolio simplicity, overweight small value stocks by adding a small value fund to the market portfolio.&lt;ref&gt;Sample portfolios using small cap tilts are included in [[Lazy Portfolios]]:
*[[Lazy Portfolios#Bill Schultheis's "Coffeehouse" Portfolio]]
*[[Lazy Portfolios#William Bernstein's "Coward's" Portfolio]]
*[[Lazy Portfolios#Frank Armstrong's "Ideal Index" Portfolio]]&lt;/ref&gt; Overweight means increasing your holdings to more than is naturally in the market profile. 

As an example, the Small cap styles represent 9% (3 + 3 + 3) of the total market. ''Tilting to Small'' means overweighting your portfolio to hold more than 9% of Small cap stocks.

==Considerations==
===Asset allocation===
Bogleheads author [[Larry Swedroe]] suggests that tilting to stocks with higher expected returns, such as small-cap and value, can allow the investor reduce overall equity exposure while maintaining the same expected return for the portfolio. Holding a smaller allocation to stocks and a larger allocation to bonds reduces "fat tail" risk; i.e., the risk of unexpected events that have a large negative impact on the overall stock market.

===Duration===
Tilted portfolios require long holding periods as the market, value, and size factor returns often rotate over time.&lt;ref&gt; [[William Bernstein]], [http://www.efficientfrontier.com/ef/700/factors.htm Factor Rotation], ''Efficient Frontier'', Summer 2000. &lt;/ref&gt;
===Investor behavior===
The investor's behavior during bear and bull markets can influence results. An investor who tilts must be able to hold to the allocation during periods when the tilted equity portfolio underperforms the market portfolio. An investor should also resist the temptation to engage in "performance chasing", that is buying or selling a size or style tilt based on recent performance.
===Rate of return===
Although small-cap and value stocks may have higher expected returns than large-cap and growth stocks, investors should recognize that the record of realized returns does not assure a similar pattern in the future. The timing and magnitude of the small and value premiums will always be uncertain, i.e. past performance does not predict future performance.

===Taxes===
In a taxable account, value funds have an additional tax cost, because they tend to have higher dividend yields. Rebalancing between multiple funds may also add to the tax cost if the rebalancing cannot be done with new money. Small-cap and value index funds are more likely to realize capital gains, although tax-managed funds and [[ETFs]] reduce this tax effect. Much of the extra tax cost can be avoided by [[Principles of Tax-Efficient Fund Placement|tax-efficient fund placement]] for an investor with both tax-advantaged and taxable accounts if the value funds can all be held in a tax-advantaged account.

The model takes into account the asset's sensitivity to non-diversifiable risk (also known as systematic risk or market risk), often represented by the symbol beta (β), as well as the expected return of the market and the expected return of a theoretical risk-free asset.

==Risk and return==
In general, investors expect higher returns from higher risks. Conversely, investors will accept lower returns to reduce risk.

An asset has two types of risk: systematic and unsystematic.

Unsystematic risk is the risk of an individual security or portfolio; systematic risk is the risk inherent in the whole market. In a portfolio, unsystematic risk is effectively "random noise" in its ''volatility of returns''. By diversifying (adding many securities), the random noise component eventually averages out to zero (the definition of random noise). The standard deviation of the portfolio's return also falls as the number of securities in the portfolio increases.

If there are enough assets in a portfolio to ensure that diversification ''cannot'' affect the performance, the portfolio's return volatility matches that of the overall market.

Risk that diversification cannot reduce is ''systematic'' risk. The degree to which a portfolio's return varies relative to that of the overall market measures the amount of systematic volatility.

===Beta===
Beta (β) is calculated by taking the risk-adjusted return R&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; (return over the risk-free rate, also known as the "Risk-adjusted" or "excess" return) over a time period of the individual asset (i) (or portfolio) divided by the risk-adjusted return (R&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;) of the market. Simplifying further, β is the slope of the line of the returns over this period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Forum link|p=2875294|title=Re: Suggestions for the Wiki|author=moshe|date=April 19, 2016}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.wikihow.com/Calculate-Beta| title=How to Calculate Beta (with Pictures)| publisher=wikihow| accessdate=October 20, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:β = Slope of the line = R&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; / R&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;.

For example: If an equity X has a return of 8%, the [[Risk and return#Measuring risk: historical returns|expected return]] of the market ''m'' is 10%, and the risk-free rate is 2%:

:β = 0.75 = R&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; / R&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; = (8% - 2%) / (10% - 2%)

More comprehensively, beta (β) describes the relationship between the returns of a security or portfolio (an ''asset'') and the returns of the market as a whole; it combines the correlation of the asset's returns and the market's returns with the relative volatility of those returns:

:β = cov(r&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;, r&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;) / σ&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ρ(r&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;, r&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;) × (σ&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; / σ&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;)
:where:
:*r&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; is the set of returns of the asset
:*r&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; is the set of returns of the market
:*σ&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is the variance of the returns of the market
:*cov(r&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;, r&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;) is the covariance between the returns of the asset and the returns of the market
:*ρ(r&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;, r&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;) is the correlation between the returns of the asset and the returns of the market
:*σ&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; is the standard deviation of the returns of the asset
:*σ&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; is the standard deviation of the returns of the market

Market risk (β) is calculated using historical returns for both the asset and the market, with the market portfolio being represented by a broad index, for example the [[S&amp;P 500 index]] or the Russell 2000 index.

==Capital Asset Pricing Model==
===Assumptions===
The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) tries to quantify the relationship between the beta of an asset and its corresponding expected return. It makes several assumptions:
#Investors care only about expected returns and volatility of returns. Therefore, it maximizes expected returns for any given level of expected volatility of returns.
#All investors have the same beliefs about the risk/reward trade-offs in the market.
#There is only one risk factor common to a broad-based market portfolio, called systematic market risk. It assumes that investors hold diversified portfolios. As a result, the CAPM model states that if an asset's beta is known, it can predict the corresponding expected return.

===Model description===

There are three areas of interest:

:1. &lt;u&gt;β = 0&lt;/u&gt;: An asset that has no volatility of returns (no risk) does not have returns that vary with the market, and therefore has a beta of zero and an expected return equal to the risk-free rate.
:2. &lt;u&gt;β = 1&lt;/u&gt;: An asset that moves with a volatility of returns exactly equal to the market's has a beta of one. In other words, the returns are perfectly positively correlated. By definition, its expected return is equal to the market's expected return:
::E(r&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;) = E(r&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;)
:3. &lt;u&gt;β &gt; 1&lt;/u&gt;: An asset that experiences greater swings in periodic returns than the market, which, by definition, has a beta greater than one. This asset is expected to earn better than market returns to compensate for this extra risk.

Making a lot of generalizations leads to the CAPM model:
:E(r&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;) = r&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; + β&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;(E(r&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;) - r&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;)
:where:
:*E(r&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;) is the expected return of the asset
:* r&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; is the risk-free rate
:*E(r&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;) is the expected return of the market portfolio
(Note: the quantity E(r&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;) - r&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;, which is the expected excess return of the market above the risk-free rate, is called the ''market risk premium'', often abbreviated ''MRP''.)

The general idea of CAPM is that investors should be compensated in two ways: time value of money, and risk.
*The time value of money is represented by the risk-free (r&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;) rate in the formula, and compensates investors for placing money in any investment over a period of time.
*The other part of the formula represents risk, and calculates the amount of compensation the investor needs for taking on additional risk. It does this by using an estimate of risk, (β&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;), and multiplying by the MRP, (E(r&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;) - r&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;).

An asset is expected to earn the risk-free rate plus a reward for bearing risk as measured by that asset’s beta. The figure below shows this predicted relationship between beta and expected return – this line is called the Security Market Line.

[[image:CAPM.png|border]]

For example, a stock with a beta of 1.5 would be expected to have an excess return of 15% in a time period where the overall market beat the risk-free asset by 10%.

The CAPM model is used for pricing an individual security or a portfolio. For individual securities, the security market line (SML) and its relation to expected return and systematic risk (beta) shows how the market must price individual securities in relation to their security risk class.

Because the CAPM predicts expected returns of assets or portfolios relative to risk and market return, it can also be used to evaluate the performance of active fund managers. The difference is "excess return", which is often referred to as alpha (α). If α is greater than zero, the portfolio lies above the Security Market Line.

==Shortcomings of the CAPM model==
The CAPM model has several shortcomings. Criticisms include incorrectly predicting results compared to realized returns, and the effects of other risk factors. Its assumption that there is a single risk factor limits the model's usefulness.

[[Eugene F. Fama|Eugene Fama]] and [[Kenneth R. French|Kenneth French]] found that on average, a portfolio’s beta explains about 70% of its actual returns. For example, if a portfolio is up 10%, about 7% of the return can be explained by the advance of all stocks and the other 3% is the result of other factors not related to beta. This observation led to the development of the [[Fama and French three-factor model]].

==Other uses of CAPM==
CAPM is also used to cost equities in applications other than investing. For example, the [[wikipedia:Weighted average cost of capital|Weighted average cost of capital]] (the rate that a company is expected to pay to finance its assets) uses CAPM to calculate the ''cost of equity'':

:Weighted Average Cost of Capital (for a firm)
::= (% of the firm in debt, at market value) × K&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;[''cost of debt''] × (1 - marginal tax rate for the firm)
:::+ (% of the firm in equity, at market value) × K&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;[''cost of equity'']

(Note: this formula assumes the firm has only debt and common equity; that is, no preferred equity.) 

:K&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; is estimated using the CAPM:
::K&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; = r&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; + β&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;(E(r&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;) - r&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;)
:where:
:*K&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; is the cost of equity
:*r&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; is the risk-free rate of return
:*E(r&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;) is the expected return of the market
:*E(r&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;) - r&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; is the market risk premium and is held to be, normally, between 4% - 5% (real) per year (the last 110 years of UK data, similar to the US)

(Another method of calculating K&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; uses the [[Dividend discount model]].)

With Vanguard currently offering several broad international index funds, some investors may wonder what they should buy in their portfolios. Here is an attempt to address '''frequently asked questions''' about these funds.

== Basic questions ==

=== What broad international index funds does Vanguard have? ===

* [{{vf|0113}} Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund]
* [{{vf|0770}} Vanguard FTSE All-World ex-US Index Fund]

=== Should I buy Total International or FTSE All-World ex-US? ===

Both funds are broadly diversified international index funds, which include both developed and emerging market stocks. The Total International Index fund tracks the [[FTSE Global All Cap ex US Index|FTSE Global All Cap ex-US Index,]] providing access to large cap, mid cap, and small cap international stocks. The FTSE All-World ex-US Index fund, tracks the [[FTSE All World ex US Index|FTSE All World ex-US Index]] which covers large cap and mid cap stocks.

==== FTSE All-World ex-US ====

* Tax efficient. The fund has distributed, on average, 75% [[Qualified dividend | qualified dividends]] since inception . The fund is eligible for the [[foreign tax credit]]. It is very unlikely to distribute capital gains in the event that a country (think South Korea) moves out of emerging markets and joins developed markets.
* The investor share [[Expense ratios |expense ratio]] (0.29%) is higher than that of Total International (0.22%)
* The fund offers admiral shares with an expense ratio of 0.14%. As a general rule, expense ratios decline as fund assets increase.
* Covers large cap and mid cap stocks. Includes Canada.

==== Total International ====

* The fund has distributed, on average, 75% [[Qualified dividend | qualified dividends]] under the qualified dividend tax regime. The fund qualifies for the foreign tax credit.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The Total International fund completed transition from the fund of funds structure (which does not pass along the foreign tax credit) in 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; It is very unlikely to distribute capital gains in the event that a country moves out of emerging markets and joins developed markets. 
* The expense ratio (0.22%) is lower than that of FTSE All-World ex-US (0.29%). 
* Offers admiral shares (expense ratio 0.14%). As a general rule, expense ratios decline as fund assets increase.
* Covers large cap, mid cap and small cap stocks. Includes Canada.

=== Should I exchange FTSE All-World ex-US for Total International Admiral for the lower ER? ===

Total International's target index includes both Canada and small cap stocks, which makes the fund look more attractive to many Bogleheads. If you already hold FTSE All-World Ex-US you might be tempted to exchange it for Total International, but you should look at the costs and benefits of the exchange more closely.

If you are holding FTSE All-World Ex-US in your taxable account and have significant unrealized capital gains it is probably not worth making the conversion. The difference between an admiral share ER of 0.14% and 0.15% is a mere -$1/year per $10000 invested. 

A reasonable alternative is to hold your FTSE All-World Ex-US mutual fund and direct new money to Total International.

=== What is foreign tax credit? ===

The [[Foreign tax credit |foreign tax credit]], in our context, is a refund of tax that Vanguard pays in foreign countries on dividends. When Vanguard distributes dividends, they are already reduced by tax paid in foreign countries. With foreign tax credit, you can get that amount back, but you still have to pay Federal income tax on the dividends before the foreign tax is paid. Sorry, foreign tax credit is not free money. 

=== I am running out of tax-advantaged room. Should I put Total Stock Market or FTSE All-World ex-US in a taxable account? ===

In general, you want to put either FTSE All-World ex-US or Total International Index in a taxable account so that you can get a [[foreign tax credit]], but the difference is not that great, so your individual situation may be different. In particular, if your [[401(k)]] has better international funds than US funds, then you probably want to hold the international funds in your 401(k).

=== Should I hold FTSE All-World ex-US or Total International Index in a taxable account for a foreign tax credit even though I have not maxed out my tax-advantaged account? ===

No, you should fill your tax-advantaged accounts first. The main exception is a [[401(k)]] or [[403(b)]] with expenses so high that they negate the benefit of either tax-deferred growth or tax-free growth; you should only invest enough in such an account to get the maximum employer match. Another exception may be a non-deductible Traditional IRA. It may not be a good idea to place a tax-efficient stock index fund in a non-deductible Traditional IRA. See [[Non-deductible Traditional IRA]] for more information.

=== Wow, FTSE All-World ex-US has expense ratio of 0.29%? Should I buy VEU, the ETF share class of FTSE All-World ex-US, to save on the expenses? ===

You can gain admiral share status with the fund for an investment of $10,000. If you take the ETF route, keep in mind that you will likely have to pay a commission on the purchase and sale if you do not purchase directly from Vanguard. In general, ETF shares may be a good choice if:

* you already have a brokerage account which has low commissions (no more than $10 or so),
* you are planning to invest in large lump sum(s), rather than small monthly contributions (which would incur a commission at every purchase),
* your brokerage allows for (free) reinvestment of fund distributions, and
* you can resist the temptation to trade the ETFs too often.

For a general discussion of whether to go ETF, see [http://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=10522 To ETF or Not to ETF].

You may also want to use a calculator at [https://personal.vanguard.com/us/faces/JSP/Funds/Tools/FundsToolsEtfCostSelectionContent.jsp?etfId=0 Calculate and compare costs for Vanguard ETFs and mutual funds] to see if going with the ETF makes sense for you.

== Advanced questions ==

=== I heard that slicing and dicing boosts return. Why go broad? ===
{{Main|Slice and dice international}}

=== The FTSE All-World ex-US lacks small-cap stocks. What should I buy to fill that area? ===
{{Main|Vanguard FTSE All-World ex-US Small-Cap Index Fund}}
The Vanguard Total International Index includes the market weighting of international small cap stocks.

Vanguard now has the [{{vf|1684}} Vanguard FTSE All-World ex-US Small-Cap Index Fund]. If you use this fund, it is more natural to use FTSE All-World ex-US for your large-cap allocation, as the two funds track exactly complementary indexes.

=== I would like some value tilt. What options does Vanguard provide? ===

For a [[Value tilting - stock|value tilt]] you might consider [{{vf|0046}} Vanguard International Value Fund]. If you are interested in growth tilt, consider [{{vf|0081}} Vanguard International Growth Fund]. Both of these are actively managed funds and thus often distribute capital gains. You should consider placing them in a tax-advantaged account.

=== How are the international funds priced when there is always a market open and trading somewhere in the world? ===

Share price, also known as [[Net asset value | ''net asset value'']] (NAV), is calculated each business day as of the close of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange, generally 4 p.m., Eastern Time. This is true for both domestic and international funds.

Stocks held by a Vanguard fund are valued at their ''market value'' when reliable market quotations are readily available. The values of any foreign securities held by a fund are converted into U.S. dollars using an exchange rate obtained from an independent third party.

When reliable market quotations are not readily available, securities are priced at their [[Fair value pricing | ''fair-value'' ]](the amount that the owner might reasonably expect to receive upon the sale of a security). A fund will also use fair-value pricing if the value of a security it holds has been materially affected by events occurring before the fund's pricing time but after the close of the primary markets or exchanges on which the security is traded. This most commonly occurs with foreign securities, which may trade on foreign exchanges that close many hours before the fund's pricing time. Intervening events might be company-specific (e.g. earnings report, merger announcement); country-specific (e.g. natural disaster, economic or political news, act of terrorism, interest rate change); or global. Intervening events include price movements in U.S. markets that are deemed to affect the value of foreign securities.

Fair-value prices are determined according to procedures adopted by a fund's board of trustees. When fair-value pricing is employed, the prices of securities used by a fund to calculate the NAV may differ from quoted or published prices for the same securities.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' looks at how you might split your equity allocation between US and ex-US stocks.

According to Vanguard's [{{Vf | vtwax}} Total World Stock Index Fund], a market-capitalization-weighted index designed to measure the market performance of large-, mid-, and small-capitalization stocks of companies located around the world, as of mid-2023 around 40% of the world's stock investment opportunities, as measured by [[Market Capitalization | market capitalization]], are outside the United States.

== Domestic/international allocation ==

It makes sense to consider diversifying your portfolio by taking advantage of the large asset class of international stocks. Focusing solely on the U.S. means you could be missing many attractive investment opportunities.

Also, according to [[wikipedia:Modern portfolio theory|Modern portfolio theory]]:
{{blockquote|Systematic risk (a.k.a. portfolio risk or market risk) refers to the risk common to all securities—except for selling short ..., systematic risk cannot be diversified away (within one market). Within the market portfolio, asset specific risk will be diversified away to the extent possible. Systematic risk is therefore equated with the risk (standard deviation) of the market portfolio.}}
One consequence of this is that the market portfolio is a starting point for most portfolios, and you need to take any specific risk toward tilting to a home country with care, and make any choice to tilt a conscious one.

Consider that [http://individual.troweprice.com/public/Retail/Mutual-Funds/International-Funds/International-Investing-Explained?WTARank=13&amp;WTARankPhrase=benefits%20of%20international%20stocks in international markets you will find]...
* seven of the ten largest automobile companies
* seven of the ten largest diversified telecommunications companies
* eight of the ten largest metals and mining companies
* six of the ten largest electronic equipment and instruments companies
* five of the ten largest household durables companies

Despite the potential drawbacks of a perceived higher risk, the impact of currency fluctuations, higher investment costs, and an aversion to short-term underperformance relative to domestic markets, international stock investments give you more diversification than an all-U.S. equity allocation.

[[Image:US-International.png|thumb|Figure 2: Graph of U.S./International allocation 'efficient frontier' (1970-2008)]]
The graph in [[:File:US-International.png|Figure 2]] shows relative investment return and volatility (standard deviation of return) for a U.S. S&amp;P 500 index investment as well as an international EAFE (Europe, Australia, Far East) index investment. The graph shows the years from 1970 -- the first full year of the EAFE index -- to the end of 2008; a 39-year investment period.
During the full period, the S&amp;P 500 index had both a higher return and a lower standard deviation than the EAFE index. However, notice the non-linear curve of the graph. This graph shows what is known as an efficient frontier and shows that adding the diversifying effect of the EAFE portfolio (in 10% increments as denoted by the squares) to an all-U.S. S&amp;P 500 portfolio actually increased return while also decreasing standard deviation. The 'most efficient' point being around a 70% S&amp;P 500/30% EAFE combination. But notice that adding anywhere from  1-40% EAFE resulted in an increased return with either a similar or lower standard deviation. However, it must be noted that this data is limited in time period and entirely backward-looking - it is unknown what the proper mix may be in the future based only on the past.

[[Image:World.png|thumb|left|Figure 5: Graph of S&amp;P 500, EAFE, and MSCI World indexes]]
[[Image:US-International-by-decade.png|thumb|Figure 3: Graph of U.S./International allocation 'efficient frontier' (by decades)]]
Of course, these returns are based on historical numbers for a nearly 40-year period. Looking at [[:File:US-International-by-decade.png|Figure 3]], which shows the efficient frontier by decade, it is obvious that the optimal U.S./International allocation differs depending on the period. However, one thing is clear, and that is that combining both U.S. and International stocks has historically increased your return, decreased your volatility of returns, or both.

[[Image:US-International-Emerging.png|thumb|Figure 4: Graph of U.S./International allocation 'efficient frontier' (including emerging markets)]]
[[:File:US-International-Emerging.png|Figure 4]] is similar to [[:File:US-International.png|Figure 2]]. However, instead of using just the EAFE developed market international index, it combines that with international emerging market figures when they became available from 1988 onward. Figure 4 shows the even greater diversification effect of both developed and emerging markets stocks when added to an all-U.S. stock portfolio.

Another way to visualize the diversification benefits of holding both U.S. and international equities is shown in [[:File:World.png|Figure 5]]. This graph shows the growth of an initial $100,000 investment over the period of 1972 to 2007. The S&amp;P 500 index is representative of United States stocks, while the EAFE (Europe, Australia, and Far East) index is representative of developed international markets. The MSCI World index is comprised of all developed market countries. Their percentage in the index is weighted by their global market-capitalization, and so fluctuates in size as each country increases or decreases its world market presence.

Unlike the previous graphs mentioned, which held a static U.S. to international weighting, the MSCI World index shown in [[:File:World.png|Figure 5]] has fluctuated quite a bit with the U.S. comprising the majority of the index during the early periods, Japan dominating during the 1980s, and Europe gaining an increasing share more recently as the U.S. percentage has declined to about 45%. So while this graph may not be directly comparable to one showing a static U.S. to international allocation, what it does show is that, historically, holding a global-market weighted index has included a diversification benefit in that the investment return was higher than an all U.S. allocation, while its volatility (or standard deviation) was significantly tempered from that of an all international allocation.

The increased number of globally oriented equity funds such as Vanguard's Total World Stock Index Fund may reflect a shift in thinking regarding domestic/international equity allocations. Both because markets tend to move in different cycles and because you want to diversify your currency exposure, the need for both U.S. and international allocations is a common recommendation. With U.S.-based companies now deriving a significant portion of their revenue from overseas, and conversely, international companies making large portions of their sales in the U.S., the idea that you need to treat U.S. and international stocks as distinct assets has been somewhat blurred.

== Main types of international funds ==

Some international funds select stocks from many countries, while others focus on a particular region or country. Still others select investments from countries with similar economic conditions, including the two major distinctive types of either developed markets or emerging markets.

*A developed market exists in a country that is a fully modern industrial nation with a well-established stock market, such as most Western European nations, Canada, Japan, and Australia.
*Emerging markets are nations evolving from an agricultural to an industrial economy or from a government-controlled economy to a free market, such as Argentina, Indonesia, Hungary, and India.

Not surprisingly, the risks are generally higher in the emerging markets, where governments and financial markets may be less certain. On the other hand, emerging markets may offer the potential for faster economic growth as well as market cycles that are less synchronized with the developed markets.

== Risks of international investing ==

'''Currency risk'''. Investments denominated in foreign currencies decline in value for U.S. investors when the U.S. dollar rises in value against those currencies. Conversely, the investments rise in value when the U.S. dollar weakens. There have been prolonged periods when the dollar has weakened against foreign currencies and others when it has strengthened.

'''Country risk'''. Events in a specific country—such as political upheaval, financial troubles, or a natural disaster—can drive down the stock prices of companies in that country. You can reduce but not eliminate this risk by choosing an international fund that invests in many countries and has a strong focus on developed nations.

'''Liquidity risk'''. Sometimes foreign stocks can be difficult to buy or sell, in part because trading volume on foreign stock exchanges tends to be much lower than on U.S. exchanges. Liquidity risk means the fund manager may have trouble buying or selling stocks without causing their prices to rise or fall substantially. You can reduce this risk by focusing on funds that invest in many countries and on those with well-established financial markets.

== Risks of home country investing ==

'''Currency risk'''. Currency risk can cut both ways. While we earn and spend most of our money in home-country currency, we also have many assets in that currency not accounted for within investing portfolios - future earnings (human capital), homes and other goods - so the need to minimize foreign-currency exposure may not be as great as it first appears from a portfolio-only perspective.

Consider two common cases: a young investor who is mostly in stocks is also heavy on human capital in general, while an older investor who has moved toward more (home-country) bonds has less human capital but also less equity exposure in general. In either instance, currency risk is mitigated by elements seen and unseen. Thus, many if not most glide paths provide less currency risk upon closer inspection, once an individual's entire financial situation is accounted for.

There is no expected return to currency diversification in itself. However, some degree of zero-expected-return diversification (for example, currencies and commodities) can be beneficial to a portfolio's total risk/return profile. Finally, some people plan to spend money abroad at points in their life, making other-currency holdings potentially advantageous.

'''Country risk'''. Again, this is a risk that cuts both ways. As illustrated in the previous section, country-specific risk is a concern for portfolios. This is not, however, limited to foreign countries. No matter how strong and developed a single market may seem, there are cases (like Japan) in which the market has underperformed for decades. In the early 2000s, the United States underperformed the global market for a lengthy period.

'''Liquidity risk'''. In an effectively efficient market, you should presume that liquidity risk is a factor in returns - or to put it another way: the market has priced in such risks and provides expected rewards in return for them. The best way to control equity risk is, in general, not to avoid a subset of equities, but to hold more assets in bonds or cash-like instruments for diversification.

== Suggested allocations ==
Determining an appropriate domestic/international allocation is a subject of much debate. See: [[Three-fund portfolio#Combining domestic and international stocks | Combining domestic and international stocks]].

The '''foreign tax credit''' is intended to reduce the double tax burden that would otherwise arise when foreign income is taxed by both the United States and the foreign country from which the income is derived.  The credit is the amount you paid to the foreign country, but it is usually limited up to the fraction of your U.S. income tax corresponding to taxable income attributed to the foreign country; for example, if 5% of your taxable income was subject to foreign tax, you cannot take a credit for more than 5% of your U.S. tax.  Details are in IRS [http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1116.pdf Form 1116] and [http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i1116.pdf Form 1116 Instructions].

==Qualifying for the foreign tax credit==
Generally, income taxes paid or accrued to a foreign country or a U.S. possession, or taxes paid or accrued to a foreign country or U.S. possession in lieu of an income tax, will qualify for the foreign tax credit.

The IRS defines four tests that must be met for any foreign tax to qualify for the credit:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=September 26, 2022|title=Foreign Taxes that Qualify for the Foreign Tax Credit|url=https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/foreign-taxes-that-qualify-for-the-foreign-tax-credit|access-date=October 1, 2022|website=Internal Revenue Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;There are are some foreign taxes for which you cannot take a foreign tax credit. See: [https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/foreign-taxes-that-qualify-for-the-foreign-tax-credit Foreign Taxes that Qualify for the Foreign Tax Credit], Internal Revenue Service.&lt;/ref&gt;

#The tax must be imposed on you. You can claim a credit only for foreign taxes that are imposed on you by a foreign country or U.S. possession. For example, a tax that is deducted from your wages is considered to be imposed on you.
#You must have paid or accrued the tax. You can claim a credit only if you paid or accrued the foreign tax to a foreign country or U.S. possession.
#The tax must be the legal and actual foreign tax liability. Your qualified foreign tax is only the legal and actual foreign tax liability that you paid or accrued during the year.
#The tax must be an income tax (or a tax in lieu of an income tax).
Tax-deferred accounts, such as a [[Traditional IRA]] or [[401(k)]], don't qualify for the foreign tax credit because the income in those accounts is not subject to US income tax. Withdrawals from a [[Roth IRA]] also don't qualify for the foreign tax credit because withdrawals are not taxed by the IRS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=April 2021|title=Claiming Foreign Taxes: Credit or Deduction?|url=https://workplace.schwab.com/resource-center/insights/content/claiming-foreign-taxes-credit-or-deduction|access-date=October 1, 2022|website=Charles Schwab}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tax forms==
For [[mutual fund]] shareholders, you may be able to claim the credit based on your share of foreign income taxes paid by the fund if it chooses to pass the credit on to its shareholders. You should receive from the mutual fund a Form 1099-DIV, or similar statement, showing the foreign country or U.S. possession, your share of the foreign income, and your share of the foreign taxes paid. Form 1099-DIV Box 6 reports foreign tax paid, and this amount is included in Box 1a, even though it represents dividends you don't actually receive.

You can choose to take the amount of any qualified foreign taxes paid or accrued during the year as a foreign tax credit or as an itemized deduction. To choose the deduction, you must itemize deductions on [http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1040sa.pdf Form 1040, Schedule A]. To choose the foreign tax credit you generally must complete [http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1116.pdf Form 1116] and attach it to your Form 1040.

:'''Exception:''' you do not have to complete [http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1116.pdf Form 1116] to take the credit if all five of the following apply:
#All of your gross foreign source income was from interest and dividends and all of that income and the foreign tax paid on it were reported to you on Form 1099-INT, Form 1099-DIV, or Schedule K-1.
#If you had dividend income from shares of stock, you held those shares for at least 16 days.
#You are not filing [http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f4563.pdf Form 4563] (Exclusion of income for bona fide residents of American Samoa) or excluding income from sources within Puerto Rico.
#The total of your foreign taxes was not more than $300, or $600 if married filing jointly.
# All of your foreign taxes were:
#*Legally owed and not eligible for a refund, and
#* Paid to countries that are recognized by the United States and do not support terrorism.

==Example of how it affects your taxes==

Say that you hold an international stock fund.  The stocks in the fund earn $1000 in dividends, but foreign countries withhold tax of $70 on those dividends.  Therefore, the fund only pays you $930 in dividends; this is what you will receive if you hold the fund in a tax-advantaged account.

Now say that you hold the fund in a taxable account, you are in a 22% tax bracket, and 70% of the dividends are [[qualified dividend|qualified]]. Your Form 1099-DIV reports $1000 in dividends, $70 in foreign tax withheld, and $700 in qualified dividends. 

When you do your taxes, you would owe tax on the full $1000 in dividends; 15% of the $700 qualified dividend and 22% of the $300 non-qualified dividend is $171. Without the foreign tax credit, this would result in a total tax impact of $241, including $171 for U.S. taxes and $70 in foreign withholding.

Next, you take the foreign tax credit, which reduces your tax liability by $70 (assuming no limitations apply), so your total U.S. tax liability would only be $101. The foreign tax credit applied here results in a total tax impact of $171, including only $101 for U.S. taxes and $70 in foreign withholding.

You have $829 after tax, just as if you had received the full $1000 and there had been no foreign tax withholding.

==Choosing to take the credit or a deduction==

You can choose each tax year to take the amount of any qualified foreign taxes paid or accrued during the year as a foreign tax credit or as an itemized deduction. You can change your choice for each year's taxes.

To choose the foreign tax credit, you generally must complete [http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1116.pdf Form 1116], as mentioned above. To choose to claim the taxes as an itemized deduction, use [http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1040sa.pdf Form 1040, Schedule A (Itemized Deductions)].

Although no one rule covers all situations, it is generally better to take a credit for qualified foreign taxes than to deduct them as an itemized deduction on [http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1040sa.pdf Form 1040, Schedule A]. This is because:

# A credit reduces your actual U.S. income tax on a dollar-for-dollar basis, while a deduction reduces only your income subject to tax
#You can choose to take the foreign tax credit even if you do not itemize your deductions. You then are allowed the standard deduction in addition to the credit, and
# If you choose to take the foreign tax credit, and the taxes paid or accrued exceed the credit limit for the tax year, you may be able to carry over or carry back the excess to another tax year.

==How to find information for Vanguard funds==
In order to fill out Form 1116, you need to list your total foreign source income.  If you hold a Vanguard mutual fund, or hold Vanguard [[exchange-traded fund]]s (ETFs) in a Vanguard brokerage account, you will receive a Foreign Tax Paid Reporting Information statement which lists the total.  If you hold a non-Vanguard fund or ETF in a Vanguard brokerage account, or hold funds or ETFs in a non-Vanguard brokerage account, the brokerage may not list the foreign source income, so you will need to find the correct amount from the ETF provider.

For Vanguard, select Investor Resources and Education-&gt;Tax Center, then click on "Tax Information for Vanguard Funds."  This has links to several tax documents, including "Vanguard funds that are eligible for the foreign tax credit."  For 2023, the document is [https://investor.vanguard.com/content/dam/retail/publicsite/en/documents/taxes/piftcws-2024.pdf Vanguard funds that are eligible for the foreign tax credit] (2023 data despite the 2024 in the file name).

This document lists the foreign income percentage, which you multiply by the total income from the fund to find the foreign amount.  It also lists the foreign qualified dividend percentage, which you may need if the Form 1116 instructions require you to adjust your foreign qualified dividends; this applies if you are in a 32% or higher tax bracket, or if you have over $20K in foreign qualified dividends and long-term gains.

==State income taxes==
Some states allow a credit for foreign income taxes, computed the same way as the credit for taxes paid to other states; combined with the federal credit, this gives a double benefit.  Since the state tax rate is usually lower than the foreign tax rate, you will not get a full state credit for the foreign tax, but the foreign income will be effectively tax-free.  In these states, it is particularly attractive to hold foreign stocks in a taxable account

According to [http://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/misc/lfb/informational_papers/january_2019/0004_individual_income_tax_provisions_in_the_states_informational_paper_4.pdf Individual Income Tax Provisions in the states], the foreign tax credit is available in AL, AZ, HI, IA, MT, NC, and a limited credit in LA.

As an alternative to investing in a foreign total market fund, it is possible to '''slice and dice international''' allocations by holding separate regional funds: [[Emerging market stocks|emerging markets]] plus either a developed markets fund or separate Pacific rim and European funds.

==Characteristics of slice and dice==
The primary advantage of a total market fund is simplicity: a single fund whose market weights are maintained automatically. A secondary benefit for a Vanguard investor is possible inclusion of Canadian stocks, which represent about 6% of Vanguard Total International Index Fund.

Possible advantages and disadvantages of [[Slice and dice |slicing and dicing]] internationally involve costs, taxes, and diversification. 

The relative cost advantage of using [[ETF]]s or [[mutual fund]]s depends on many factors, including size and frequency of the investment, expected holding period, the level of commission and trading costs, and realized return. To determine the relative costs between an ETF and a mutual fund, you can use Vanguard's [https://personal.vanguard.com/us/faces/JSP/Funds/Tools/FundsToolsEtfCostSelectionContent.jsp?etfId=0 cost comparison calculator].

===Currency diversification===
According to [[Rick Ferri]] in ''[[All About Asset Allocation]]'', having fixed allocations between Europe, Pacific, and emerging market diversifies currencies better than one fund.

===Possible rebalancing bonus===
Also according to [[Rick Ferri]], rebalancing across those currencies "could provide a diversification benefit, as it has in the past". [[William Bernstein]] suggests a rebalancing bonus may be obtainable with emerging markets (see [[#External links|External links]] below). Rebalancing in a taxable account may incur capital gains taxes.

===Overweighting pacific or emerging markets===
Historically, Europe has been more correlated with the U.S. market than pacific and emerging markets, so you may want to overweight pacific or emerging markets. The market weight as of January 31, 2010 was approximately 50.1% Europe, 26.2% pacific and 23.7% emerging markets according to the allocation of the [{{Vf | 0113}} Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund], which follows [[Market capitalization | market capitalization]].

===Avoiding regional bubbles===
Total market funds will change as the underlying market weights change. With Japan as an example, maintaining a fixed weight to Japan and Pacific in the 1980s might have avoided an overallocation to Japan. More recently, in 2010 emerging markets increased to 23% of the world market (according to composition of Vanguard Total International Market fund, January 2010), from about 4% in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=John Bogle| author-link=John Bogle| title=Common Sense on Mutual Funds| date=1999| isbn=978-0-471-39228-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stocks may be classified by the size of the corporation. This is most commonly done looking at the [[Market capitalization| market capitalization]]. Market capitalization is simply a measurement found by taking a stock's current share price and multiplying it by the number of stock shares outstanding.

Exact market cap ranges will vary among different financial and rating institutions, but there are three different terms commonly used to describe stocks by their general size: Large Cap stocks; Mid Cap stocks; and Small Cap stocks. Market cap terms are relative and are constantly changing as companies get bigger and smaller.

{{Market cap table}}

Capitalization ranges for companies that are smaller than small cap stocks include micro cap and nano cap stocks.

Beginning with Rolf Banz in 1981&lt;ref&gt;Rolf W. Banz, "The Relationship Between Return and Market Value of Common Stocks," Journal of Financial Economics, 9 (1981), pp. 3-18 &lt;/ref&gt; and continuing with [[Eugene F. Fama]] and [[Kenneth R.

French| accessdate=June 27, 2025}} Available at SSRN.&lt;/ref&gt; academic studies have found that US small cap and US small cap value stocks provided premium returns during the twentieth century. These premium returns were accompanied by greater risk. (See Table 3 and Table 4 below). While US small cap stocks provided a 2% premium return over US large cap stocks over the twentieth century, small cap stocks declined a real -70% over three years during the Great Depression and declined a nominal -90.78% (1929 - 1932) and -53.15% (1972-1974).

In addition to a size premium, twentieth century returns showed the presence of a realized value premium. The 1926 - 2000 return of US small value stocks was 14.87% as compared to the 9.92% return of US small growth stocks.&lt;ref name="Bernstein" /&gt; Figure 1 shows the growth of a dollar investment in each of the four quadrants of market capitalization from 1927 - 2000. For investors to attain these premium returns required long term holding periods, as the market, value, and size factor returns often rotate over time and there are long periods when portfolio [[FAQ small cap funds#What does "tilting" to small mean and how much should I tilt? |tilts]] to small and small value stocks lag the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.efficientfrontier.com/ef/700/factors.htm| title=Factor Rotation| publisher=Efficient Frontier| date=2000| accessdate=June 27, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prospective risk premium===

The prospective risk premium for small cap and small value stocks is subject to debate. Classic financial theory argues that reliable future premium returns must be based on compensation for risk or there is the possibility that, because the premiums are known, they can be arbitraged away. Behavioral economists&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.quantitativeinvestment.com/documents/common.pdf| title=Commonality In The Determinants Of Expected Stock Returns| author1=Robert A. Haugen| author2=Nardin L. Baker| publisher=Journal of Financial Economics| date=1996| accessdate=June 27, 2025}})&lt;/ref&gt; have suggested [[Behavioral pitfalls|behavioral reasons]] for the historical risk premiums. 

Others, such as [[John Bogle]], have expressed doubts as to the viability of the small cap and small value premium (see: [[Telltale chart]]):
 
{{quotation|From 1925 through 1964 - a period of fully 39 years - small caps and large caps provided identical returns. Then, in just four years, through 1968, the small-cap return more than doubled the large-cap return. Virtually that entire margin was lost during the next five years. By 1973, small caps were about at par with large caps for nearly the full half-century. The small caps' reputation was made largely during the 1973-1983 decade.|John Bogle&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Common Sense on Mutual Funds: Fully Updated 10th Anniversary Edition| publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons| date=2009| isbn=0-470-13813-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

John Bogle also cites the high transaction costs in executing small cap portfolios as a hurdle for realizing small cap premiums. According to Edelen, et.al. US large cap fund have transaction costs (mean 0.77%, median 0.55%); US small cap funds have transaction costs (mean 2.85%, median 2.33%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://ssrn.com/abstract=951367| title=Scale Effects in Mutual Fund Performance: The Role of Trading Costs| author1=Roger M. Edelen| author2=Richard B. Evans| author3=Gregory B. Kadlec| accessdate=June 27, 2025}} Available at SSRN.&lt;/ref&gt;

===International markets===

Research into international stock market performance over the last quarter/half of the twentieth century provided evidence of a realized small cap premium. Hawakini and Keim (2000), in a study of 16 international markets&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author1=Gabriel Hawakini| author2=Donald B. Keim| url=http://knowledge.emory.edu/papers/794.pdf| title=The Cross Section of Common Stock Returns: A Review of the Evidence and Some New Findings| publisher=Wharton| date=1999| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120526072258/http://knowledge.emory.edu/papers/794.pdf| archive-date=May 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; found evidence of a small cap premium in 15 of the 16 countries (the exception being Korea, which provided a monthly -0.40% small cap discount). The positive monthly premium ranged from 0.41% in Singapore to 4.16% in Mexico. The data series in the study varied, with most study periods ending in the 1980s to 1990.

As Dimson, Marsh, and Staunton report, subsequent to the publication of these findings, the small cap premium reversed in international markets during the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Dimson, Marsh, and Staunton, ''Triumph of the Optimists:101 Years of Global Investment Returns'', Princeton University Press, 2002. pp.131 -135.&lt;/ref&gt; In reference to UK markets, they note:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://faculty-gsb.stanford.edu/nagel/pdfs/UK_VG.pdf| title=Capturing the Value Premium in the UK 1955-2001| date=January 2003| author1=Elroy Dimson| author2=Stefan Nagel| author3=Garrett Quigley| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060917034510/http://faculty-gsb.stanford.edu/nagel/pdfs/UK_VG.pdf| archive-date=September 6, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|Using a new dataset of accounting information merged with share price data we find a strong value premium in the UK for the period 1955-2001. The value premium exists within the small-cap as well as the large-cap universe. We also find that dividend yield as a measure of value produces strikingly similar results. The time-series of return spreads between portfolios sorted according to dividend yields closely matches the results obtained from sorts on book-to-market. However, managers attempting to capture the value premium in the small-cap segment should pay particular attention to rebalancing-induced portfolio turnover and market illiquidity in small-value stocks. Compared to the U.S., the U.K. market for small-cap stocks is relatively illiquid. Trading costs are therefore an even more crucial determinant of overall performance. This is likely to be the case in other non-U.S. markets as well.}}

The 2000s witnessed premium returns for international small cap stocks as evidenced by the performance of MSCI EAFE indexes. Small cap international stocks demonstrated lower correlation to US large (0.72 vs. EAFE 0.86) and US small (0.71 vs. 0.76 EAFE) stocks during the 1999-2008 period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author1=Gordon Johnson| author2=Shannon Ericson| author3=Vikram Srimurthy| url=http://www.publicpensionsonline.com/public/images/Sml-Cap-Intl-Diversification.pdf| title=Diversification Benefits of International Small-cap Stocks}}{{dead link}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case for persistence in lower correlation for small cap international stocks is the tendency for small cap stocks to be economically tied to local national economies as opposed to being global enterprises. 
 
As is true in US markets, international small cap stocks incur higher transaction costs compared to large cap stocks. Quigley provides transaction cost breakdowns for regional markets.

      <text bytes="19659" sha1="bddnssqds8dlnche4cz2tta8gq2u8fy" xml:space="preserve">The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is used to explain differences in the returns of diversified equity portfolios. The model compares a portfolio to three distinct risks found in the equity market to assist in decomposing returns. Prior to the three-factor model, the [[CAPM - Capital Asset Pricing Model | Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)]] was used as a "single factor" way to explain portfolio returns.

==Background==
Several shortcomings of the [[CAPM - Capital Asset Pricing Model#Model Description | CAPM model]] exist when compared to realized returns, and the effect of other risk factors have put this model under criticism. The assumption of a single risk factor limits the usefulness of this model.

[[Fama, Eugene F.|Eugene F. Fama]] and [[French, Kenneth R.|Kenneth R. French]] found that on average, a portfolio’s beta (single-factor model) only explains about 70% of its actual returns. For example, if a portfolio was up 10%, about 70% of the return can be explained by the advance of all stocks and the other 30% is due to other factors not related to beta.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.portfoliosolutions.com/our-process-2/confidencemap-planning/understanding-risk/ Fama-French Three Factor Model], [[Rick Ferri]], [http://www.portfoliosolutions.com/ Portfolio Solutions].&lt;/ref&gt;

* "Beta," the measure of market exposure of a given stock or portfolio, which was previously thought to be the be-all/end-all measurement of stock risk/return, is of only limited use. Fama-French showed that this parameter did not explain the returns of all equity portfolios, although it is still useful in explaining the return of stock/bond and stock/cash mixes.
* The return of any stock portfolio can be explained almost entirely (around 95%) by including two additional factors: Market cap ("Size") and book/market ratio ("Value"). Therefore, a portfolio with a small median market cap and a high book/market ratio will have a higher '''Expected''' return than a portfolio with a large median market cap and a low book/market ratio, if the expected return of small stocks is greater than big stocks and the expected return of high book to market stocks is greater than low book to market stocks.

The three-factor model explains up to 95% of returns for a cross-section of equity portfolios of various sizes and styles,&lt;ref name="Jr"&gt;Eugene F. Fama Jr. "[https://www.ifa.com/academic-papers/multifactor_investing_eugene_fama_2006.pdf Multifactor Investing]," Dimensional Fund Advisors, July 2006 (Eugene F. Fama Jr. is the son of [[Eugene F. Fama]])&lt;/ref&gt; independent of the sign of any of the factors.

Note: The terminology by Fama-French is different than common usage. "Book/market ratio" is the inverse of the more familiar [[P/B |"price/book ratio."]] In other words, a high book/market ratio is the same as a low price/book ratio— a "value". In their paper, high book/market is acronymed "HBM." 

In summary, Fama-French viewed both size and value as risk factors, for which you may be rewarded with extra return or punished with extra loss.

==The three-factor model==
To represent the market cap ("Size") and book/market ratio ("Value") returns, Fama and French modified the original [[CAPM - Capital Asset Pricing Model#Model Description | CAPM model]] with two additional risk [[Factors (finance) | factors]]: ''size'' risk and ''value'' risk.&lt;ref name = "Fabozzi"&gt;Frank J. Fabozzi; Edwin H. Neave; Guofu Zhou (eds). "14: Capital Asset Pricing Model". Financial Economics. John Wiley &amp; Sons. © 2011. ISBN 0-470596-20-1&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;r_{it}-r_{ft}=\alpha_i +\beta_{im}(r_{mt}-r_{ft})+\beta_{is}\mathit{SMB}_t+\beta_{ih}\mathit{HML}_t+\epsilon_{it}&lt;/math&gt;

:where &lt;math&gt;\mathit{SMB}_t&lt;/math&gt; is the "Small Minus Big" market capitalization risk factor and &lt;math&gt;\mathit{HML}_t&lt;/math&gt; is the "High Minus Low" value premium risk factor.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;See [[Fama-French three-factor model analysis]] for a complete variable description.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\mathit{SMB}&lt;/math&gt; (Small Minus Big) measures the additional return investors have historically received by investing in stocks of companies with relatively small market capitalization. This additional return is often referred to as the “size premium.”&lt;ref name="R-n-R"&gt;Womack, Kent L. and Zhang, Ying, Understanding Risk and Return, the CAPM, and the Fama-French Three-Factor Model. Tuck Case No. 03-111. Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=481881&lt;/ref&gt; The Small/Big boundary is defined by the median size of NYSE stocks.

&lt;math&gt;\mathit{HML}&lt;/math&gt; (High Minus Low) has been constructed to measure the “value premium” provided to investors for investing in companies with high book-to-market values (essentially,the value placed on the company by accountants as a ratio relative to the value the public markets placed on the company, commonly expressed as B/M).&lt;ref name="R-n-R" /&gt; High/Low is defined by the top/bottom 30% of BE/ME for NYSE stocks.

The key point of the model is that it allows investors to to weight their portfolios so that they have greater or lesser exposure to each of the specific risk factors, and therefore can target more precisely different levels of expected return.

Refer to the Risk Factor Exposure plot below, which represents a universe of opportunities. A portfolio can land anywhere on this plot (the axes values are not restricted) and an expected return can be calculated. The axes represent exposures to the two risk factors. As all equity portfolios take similar market risk (common to both), there is no need for a 3rd axis, &amp;beta; (beta).&lt;ref name = "Jr" /&gt;

The horizontal axis (X-axis) is the "Value" factor, represented as ''HML''. The left side (more negative) is termed "Growth," the right side (more positive) is "Value."

The vertical axis (Y-axis) is the "Size" factor, represented as ''SMB''. The upper side (more positive) is termed "Small Cap," the lower side (more negative) is "Large Cap."

At the plot origin (0, 0) is the "The Market," the baseline reference. The dashed line running through the origin represents equivalent market risk. Values along this line represent the point where the risk factors cancel out. For example, (-0.55, 0.55) represents ((-0.55)*''SMB'', (+0.55)*''HML''); which, when added together (and skipping a lot of details) results in the expected return of the market (stated in relative terms, which is 0.00%).

This dashed line is used to define risk relative to the market. The farther up and to the right of the market line you go, the higher the expected return and the higher the risk. Lower and to the left of the line represents less expected return but lower risk, relative to the market.&lt;ref name = "Jr" /&gt; Note that stocks which fit definitions of "Small Cap and Value" represent the highest risk and highest expected return.

&lt;/center&gt;

==Categorizing portfolios==
One powerful feature of the Three Factor Model is that it provides a way to categorize mutual funds by size and value risks, and therefore predict expected return premiums. This classification provides two main benefits.&lt;ref name="R-n-R" /&gt;

===Classifying funds into style buckets===
Funds ''(and their fund managers)'' can be compared by placing them in specific "buckets" based on the style of asset allocation chosen in their portfolios. For this purpose, funds are often plotted on a 3x3 matrix, demonstrating the
relative amount of risk represented by different strategies.

The mutual fund rating company Morningstar is the biggest resource for classification. Funds are separated horizontally into three groups through a B/M ranking (value ranking) and vertically based on a ranking of market capitalization (size ranking).
{{Notice|
The Morningstar [[Stock Basics#Style Boxes| style box]] is inverted when compared to the Risk Factor Exposure plot. Stocks classified as "Small Cap and Value" are in the lower-left corner in the equity style box, but are in the upper-right corner in the plot.}}

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:Three-Factor Model - Morningstar.png]]&lt;/center&gt;

===Specifying risk factor helps investor choices===
The second advantage of categorizing funds is that investors can easily choose the amount of exposed risk factor when investing in particular funds. This characterization is typically derived by multivariate regression. The historical returns of a specific portfolio are regressed against the historical values of the three factors, generating estimates of the coefficients.&lt;ref name="R-n-R" /&gt;

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:Three-Factor Model - Fund Profiles.png]]&lt;/center&gt;

Note how easy it is to see the spectrum of possible strategies with a style graph.

==Evaluating fund managers==
As shown above, the Three-Factor Model allows classification of mutual funds and enables investors to choose exposure to certain risk factors. This model can also used to measure historical fund manager performance to determine the amount of value added by management.

:&lt;math&gt;r_{it}-r_{ft}=\alpha_i +\beta_{im}(r_{mt}-r_{ft})+\beta_{is}\mathit{SMB}_t+\beta_{ih}\mathit{HML}_t&lt;/math&gt;

:where &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, the Y-intercept of the equation, is the ''Active Return'' and defined as:&lt;ref name="Fab10"&gt;Fabozzi, Frank J., and Harry M. Markowitz (eds). "Chapter 10 - Tracking Error and Common Stock Portfolio Management". Equity Valuation and Portfolio Management. John Wiley &amp; Sons. © 2011. ISBN 9780470929919&lt;/ref&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; = Active Return = (Portfolio Actual Return - Benchmark Actual Return)

In this case, the benchmark is the &lt;math&gt;r_{ft}&lt;/math&gt;, risk-free market return. Historical data is used in a multiple regression analysis to determine the value of &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;See [[Fama-French three-factor model analysis]] for details on how to perform the analysis. An easy-to-read comprehensive example, using a spreadsheet, can be found in [http://efficientfrontier.com/ef/101/roll101.htm Rolling Your Own: Three Factor Analysis].&lt;/ref&gt;

Alpha indicates how well the fund manager is capturing the expected returns, given the portfolio's exposure to the &lt;math&gt;\mathit{(r_{mt}-r_{ft})}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathit{HML}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathit{SMB}&lt;/math&gt; factors.

If the fund manager captures the factor exposures perfectly, the expected alpha would be zero, minus the [[Expense ratios | expense ratio]] (ER) of the fund.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;In Canada, Expense Ratio is known as Management Expense Ratio (MER).&lt;/ref&gt;  An alpha greater than this suggests that the fund manager is adding value beyond the underlying factor exposures.  In other words, the three-factor model can help determine the effectiveness of a fund manager.

''Tracking error'' is a measure of how closely a portfolio follows the index to which it is benchmarked.&lt;ref name="wp"&gt;[[wikipedia:Tracking error | Tracking error]] on Wikipedia.&lt;/ref&gt; See: [[#Tracking error | below]] for additional details.

===Tracking error===
{{main|Tracking error}}
Tracking error is measured as the dispersion of a portfolio's returns relative to the returns of its benchmark, and is expressed as the standard deviation of the portfolio's ''active return'' (annualized).&lt;ref name="Fabozzi10"&gt;Fabozzi, Frank J., and Harry M. Markowitz (eds). "Chapter 10 - Tracking Error and Common Stock Portfolio Management". Equity Valuation and Portfolio Management. John Wiley &amp; Sons. © 2011. ISBN 9780470929919&lt;/ref&gt;

A portfolio created to match the benchmark index (e.g. an index fund) that always matches its benchmark's actual return (zero active returns) would have a tracking error of zero.&lt;ref name="Fabozzi10" /&gt;

There are two types of tracking error models:&lt;ref name="Fabozzi10" /&gt;
*Based on historical performance: Also called ''backward-looking'' or  ''ex post'' tracking error.
*Predicted future performance: Also called ''predicted'' or ''ex ante'' tracking error.
Backward looking tracking error is useful to analyze fund manager performance. This model has little predictive value and may be misleading if used in that fashion.&lt;ref name="Fabozzi10" /&gt;

A portfolio manager uses a forward-looking estimate of tracking error to accurately reflect the portfolio risk going forward.&lt;ref name="Fabozzi10" /&gt;

This is done by using a ''multifactor risk model'' which contains the risks associated with the benchmark index. Statistical analysis of historical returns in the benchmark index are used to obtain the factors and quantify their risk (variances and correlations are involved). The portfolio's current exposure to the various factors are calculated and compared to the benchmark's exposures to the factors. A forward-looking tracking error is then calculated from the differential factor exposures and risks of the factors.&lt;ref name="Fabozzi10" /&gt;

The forward-looking tracking error is useful in risk control and portfolio construction. "What-if" scenarios can be evaluated to optimize the portfolio within the desired level of risk. Although there are no guarantees that the forward-looking tracking error will match the backward-looking historical error over a period of time (for example, one year), the average of forward-looking tracking error estimates obtained at different times during the year will be reasonably close to the backward-looking tracking error estimate obtained at the end of the year.&lt;ref name="Fabozzi10" /&gt;

'''{{PAGENAME}}''', also referred to as "market cap", is the total value of all outstanding shares of a publicly traded company multiplied by the [[Stock basics|stock]] price.  It is commonly used to measure the size of a corporation, and represents the market's collective valuation of a company. The investment community uses this figure to classify companies by size, rather than using revenue or total assets.

The stocks of large, medium and small companies are referred to as large caps, [[mid caps]], and [[small caps]], respectively.  There's no universal agreement on how these classifications correspond to company values, and the relationship changes over time as the aggregate value of all public companies changes.  This table shows a typical mapping, as of 2025.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.investopedia.com/investing/market-capitalization-defined/| title=Market Capitalization: What It Is, Formula for Calculating It| publisher=Investopedia| accessdate=June 15, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Market cap table}}
These ranges will vary across index providers, investment firms, and other market observers.

Less commonly used labels include: mega cap (bigger than large cap), and micro and nano cap (smaller than small cap).

Because shares of private companies do not trade in public markets, they do not have a market capitalization.  Their value is estimated based on revenue multiples, comparable company analysis, or investor negotiations.

==Frontier market stocks==
[[File:Frontiermarkets.jpg|thumb|right|550px|Figure 1. Global equity markets]]

According to FTSE, the world consists of approximately 150 nations possessing stock exchanges. FTSE classifies 48 of these nations as either developed markets or emerging markets. The remaining countries are candidates for frontier market classification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.indexuniverse.com/publications/journalofindexes/joi-articles/4439-what-are-frontier-markets.html?fullart=1&amp;start=4| title=What are Frontier Markets?| publisher=Journal of Indexes| date=Oct 2008}}{{dead link}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of countries now included in frontier market indexes come from the following constituents:
* Former soviet and marxist economies establishing private markets and stock markets. These countries include many small states in Eastern Europe and in Central Asia. Vietnam would also be included in this group.
* Middle Eastern, Arabian peninsula, and North African states establishing and opening stock markets to international investment. 

Over time, national markets can migrate from the continuum of classifications, moving between developed, emerging, and frontier markets. Index providers normally have countries on a watch list for future inclusion or exclusion into or out of a frontier market index. For example, MSCI has shifted Sri Lanka (2001), Venezuela (2006), Jordan (2009), Pakistan (2009), and Argentina (2009) from emerging market classification to frontier market classification over the past decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Lawrence Speidell| url=https://www.cfapubs.org/toc/rf/2011/2011/2| title=Frontier Market Equity Investing: Finding the Winners of the Future| publisher=Research Foundation Publications, May 2011, Vol. 2011, No. 2, CFA Institute Publications| p=3}}{{dead link}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Risk, volatility, correlation==
===Risk===
Frontier market stocks encompass all the risks affecting emerging stock markets. In the case of frontier markets, these risks are magnified. In addition to market and currency risks, frontier markets are especially susceptible to the following risks:

*'''Political risks'''. Political instability can result from external conflict, coups, and racial and national tensions. 
*'''Economic risks.''' Economic policies and reforms can fail.
*'''Regulatory and operational environment'''. The quality of market regulation, corporate governance, transparency, and accounting standards is often below that of developed markets.

===Volatility===
The volatility of frontier market stock returns, as measured by [[Standard deviation|standard deviation]], has generally been greater than the broader global market. Much of this increased volatility occurred during the 2008-2009 financial crisis. Before the crisis, frontier market stock returns exhibited lower volatility relative to U.S. and international market returns, and relative volatility has declined over the last three years. Over the span of measured returns (starting date 2003), the MSCI Frontier Market Index returns have ranged from +72.68% in 2005 to -54.15% in 2008. MSCI reports standard deviation of monthly returns for the MSCI Frontier Market Index compared to the MSCI ACWI (All Country World Index) + Frontier Markets Index in the table below:

===Correlation===
[[File:Frontiermarketcorrellation.GIF|500px|thumb|right|Figure 2. Frontier Market Correlation. Rolling 52 week correlations. ''Source: Bloomberg'']]

The correlation of frontier market returns to emerging market stock returns and developed market stock returns has been low, especially during the period preceding the 2008 financial crisis. Since the crisis period, correlations have risen. Historically, the correlation between individual frontier markets has been low, resulting in lower overall volatility from a diversified portfolio of frontier markets as opposed to an investment in a single country. This suggests that a prudent strategy would be to invest in a broad-based frontier market index.

==Transaction costs==
Frontier market stocks are less liquid and more thinly traded than developed market stocks. Transaction costs are higher than in the U.S. markets. Ben R. Nhut H. Nguyen, and Nuttawat Visaltanachoti (2011) measure frontier market spread and market impact costs and find value weighted spread costs averaging 1.86% and market impact costs averaging 0.93%. The table below provides comparative value weighted spread costs.

==Cross section of stock returns in frontier markets==

In a 2012 paper, Wilma De Groot, Juan Pang, and Laurens Swinkels&lt;ref name="De Groot"/&gt; investigate the cross section of frontier market stock returns using a unique survivorship-bias free data set consisting of more than 1,400 stocks over the period 1997 to 2008, covering 24 of the most liquid frontier emerging markets. They found the presence of economically and statistically significant value and momentum effects, and a local size effect. They also found that the value and momentum effects continued to exist when incorporating conservative assumptions of transaction costs (2.50%). In addition, the research found that value, momentum, and local size returns in frontier markets could not be explained by global risk factors. They found returns, after incorporating transactions costs, of 6.6% to 7.7% per annum for value strategies and net of expense returns of 4.6% to 7.2% for momentum strategies.

==Frontier market indexes==

Dow Jones, FTSE, MSCI, Russell, and S&amp;P provide indexes of frontier market stocks. These indexes were introduced in 2007/2008.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The S&amp;P BMI Frontier Market Index, introduced in 2008, has data backdated to 1995, based on individual country data. &lt;/ref&gt; In addition to broad market indexes, most providers supply regional indexes that cover the pan-Africa region; the Americas; Europe and Central Asia; the GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council)&lt;ref group="note"&gt; The GCC countries include Bahrain , Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and United Arab Emirates.&lt;/ref&gt; and Arabian peninsula; and the Asian markets. Given the heavy weighting of GCC countries in the broad frontier market indexes, providers also issue frontier market ex-GCC indexes.

In 2011 and 2012 index providers began creating indexes designed for easier investment. Examples include indexes such as the FTSE Frontier 50; the MSCI Frontier 100; the S&amp;P Select Frontier 40 and S&amp;P Extended Frontier 150 indexes.&lt;ref group= "note"&gt; The broader frontier market indexes include more stocks than those designed to be investable. According to 2012 fact sheets available from provider websites, The S&amp;P BMI index includes 556 stocks. The MSCI Frontier Market index, covering 85% of the market, includes 148 stocks. In 2011 MSCI introduced the MSCI Frontier Markets Investable Market Index (IMI), covering 99% of the market, and including 378 stocks. &lt;/ref&gt;

iShares launched the first index fund to track a geographically broad, focused frontier markets index (MSCI Frontier Markets 100 Index) in September, 2012. 

The table below lists the constituent national stock markets included in each provider's broad market index. Each provider defines the universe of emerging markets and frontier markets differently, so countries appearing in one provider's emerging market index can often appear in another provider's frontier market index. When investor asset allocations include both emerging market and frontier market asset classes, it is advisable to use the same provider's emerging market and frontier market indexes, thus avoiding unintended duplication of country holdings.

==Frontier market index funds==
A limited number of frontier market index funds{{#tag:ref|In 2011, Global X filed with the SEC for broad-based, regional, and individual country frontier market ETFs based on FTSE indexes.{{cite web| url=https://etfdb.com/2011/greece-etf-on-the-way-global-x-details-slew-of-international-etfs/| title=Global X Announces Plans For A Slew of International ETFS| publisher=ETFdb.com}}{{broken link}}|group="note"}} are currently available to U.S. investors as [[Exchange Traded Funds|ETFs]]. These funds include:&lt;ref group="note"&gt; ETFdb.com provides a listing of frontier market ETFs at [https://etfdb.com/etfs/region/frontier-markets/ List of Frontier Market ETFs].&lt;/ref&gt;

*The '''Guggenheim Frontier Markets ETF''': "The fund invests at least 80% of its total assets in American depositary receipts ("ADRs") and global depositary receipts ("GDRs") that comprise the Bank of New York Mellon New Frontier DR Index or in the stocks underlying such ADRs and GDRs." The fund has a 60% weighting in three countries included in most index provider's emerging market index: Columbia, Chile, and Eqypt. Thus, the fund holds a minority position in frontier market stocks.
*The '''Powershares Middle East North Africa Frontier Countries Portfolio''': " The fund invests 90% of its total assets in securities that comprise the NASDAQ OMX Middle East North Africa Index, and American Depository Receipts (ADRs) and Global Depository Receipts (GDRs) based on the securities in the Index. The Index seeks to provide direct exposure to liquid stocks of companies that have the majority of their assets or services residing in MENA frontier market countries, which include Egypt, Morocco, Oman, Lebanon, Jordan, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar and United Arab Emirates." Thus the fund is essentially a middle eastern regional fund.
*The '''iShares MSCI Frontier 100 Index Fund''': "The fund seeks investment results that correspond generally to the price and yield performance, before fees and expenses, of the MSCI Frontier Markets 100 Index." The fund exclusively tracks frontier market stocks. The fund, consistent with its underlying index, has a 50% to 60% weighting to Gulf Cooperation Council countries, and a high 50% to 60% weighting in financial stocks.

The '''dividend discount model''' is a way of valuing a company based on the theory that a [[Stock basics|stock]] is worth the discounted sum of all of its future [[dividend]] payments. Dividend discount models are used to determine if a stock is a good buy (selling at a lower current price than indicated by the model) or a bad buy (selling at a higher current price than indicated by the model).

The value of a stock is worth all of the future cash flows expected to be generated by the firm, discounted by an appropriate [[Risk|risk-adjusted]] rate. According to the model, dividends are the cash flows that are returned to the shareholder.

Over the long term, assuming dividends grow at a constant rate the stock price can be modeled as:

:&lt;math&gt;Price = D_1 / (r - g)&lt;/math&gt;

where D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the value of dividends at the end of the period, r is constant cost of equity for the firm, and g is the expected dividend growth rate.

{{for|additional information|wikipedia:Preferred stock}}

A '''preferred stock''', also known as a preferred share or simply a ''preferred'', is a share of stock carrying additional rights above and beyond those conferred by common stock. These rights include priority in receiving dividends and precedence (after creditors) over common stock shareholders in claims to corporate assets upon liquidation.

==Characteristics==
However in return for these benefits, preferred stock has limited upside. The stock is normally issued at a fixed price (say $10.00 per share) paying a fixed dividend (say $0.60). The price of the shares will fluctuate with interest rates-- down if interest rates go up, up if they go down, like bonds. They will also fluctuate with the perceived financial health of the issuer. If the stock is called or redeemed investors will normally only get par value (that is, $10.00 per share). Examples of situations that would cause this to occur include: if the stock is redeemed by the investor (if it has such a provision); called by the issuer (many of them include a call provision allowing the issuer to call them early at its discretion); or the issuer is taken over or liquidated.&lt;ref name="VT"&gt;{{forum link| p=1930113| title=Re: Can you talk me out of Preferred Stocks?| author=Valuethinker}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==As an investment==
Preferred stock, as a yield investment, acts similar to a fixed income security, the price reacting primarily to changes in interest rates. Preferreds regularly offer high yields, but in addition to interest rate risk, they are usually subject to call risk and nontrivial credit risk. Some preferreds pay qualified dividends, currently taxable to individuals at a maximum 15% rate.&lt;ref name="VT" /&gt;

Preferred stock (or shares) was once widely issued to investors looking for yield. However since the late 1970s it has become possible for most companies to issue [[High yield bonds|high yield (junk) bonds]], which have many of the same characteristics of preferred stock but where the interest coupon paid is deductible from corporate taxes. Therefore this is a more efficient form of finance from the perspective of the issuer.&lt;ref name="VT" /&gt;

The exception to this general rule is in the case of some financial stocks, particularly banks. Regulators require financial companies to have a certain amount of capital, to shield depositors against losses on their assets such as bad loans. In the balance sheet formula Assets (such as loans and mortgages for a bank) = Liabilities (Depositors and bonds) + Equity. Bank leverage (the ratio between Assets and Equity) is limited to certain maximums by regulators. Included in regulatory capital is common stock (ordinary shares), retained earnings and some forms of securities including hybrid bonds and preference stock (or preference shares). So financial institutions issue preference stock to boost their capital and reduce their leverage.&lt;ref name="VT" /&gt;

==Performance==
The performance of preference stock tends to track the performance of bonds issued by the same company, reflecting both the general level of interest rates and the market's view of the financial health of a company. If a company becomes financially distressed or bankrupt, then a restructuring is likely. Because preference shareholders rank behind debt holders (such as bond investors) in the sale or liquidation of the company, they usually get very little or nothing if there is a bankruptcy situation. In addition, if the company becomes financially distressed, the directors may deem it prudent that the company not pay any preference dividends-- preferred shareholders have limited legal rights in such a situation, whereas bondholders facing a skipped interest payment have the rights of creditors.&lt;ref name="VT" /&gt;

In a sense then preference stock often combines the worst features of corporate bonds (frequently callable; lack of upside) with those of common stock (little protection in bankruptcy; possibility dividend will be omitted). In addition portfolios of preference shares are highly concentrated around financial companies, thus reducing diversification.&lt;ref name="VT" /&gt;

==Role in a portfolio==
{{Quote
|quote =As a hybrid product in between stocks and bonds, just like junk bonds--junk bonds are stockish bonds, preferred stocks are bondish stocks...
|source=— {{forum link| p=1929005| title=Can you talk me out of Preferred Stocks?}}}}
For the reasons above, investing in preference stock is usually not recommended. The risk-return tradeoffs are unfavourable for individual investors. For corporate credit risk exposure, use corporate bond funds; for equity returns, use diversified index funds made up of common stock (like Vanguard Total Stock Market).

==Convertible preferred stocks==
{{Main|Convertible security}}
Companies do issue ''convertible preferred'' stock, which is stock which carries a right to convert into common stock at a certain pre-specified exercise (or strike) price. The analysis of the value of this option (effectively a long dated call option) to the investor is complex and it is a relatively risky area that requires expertise to make successful investments.&lt;ref name="VT" /&gt;

Unlike convertible bonds, ''convertible preferreds'' lack a maturity date -- unless they are redeemable and a date is specified at issue. ''Convertible preferreds'' have greater equity upside potential than ''straight preferreds,'' but normally lower starting yields and greater volatility.&lt;ref name="VG"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://personal.vanguard.com/us/insights/article/keele-convertible-securities-04152013| title=What you need to know about convertible securities| publisher=Vanguard}}{{dead link}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="VT2"&gt;{{forum link| p=1939177| title=Re: Wiki - Convertible Securities| author=Valuethinker}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Venture capital issuances==
Preference stock is also issued in venture capital deals. Venture capital funds invest into private companies to accelerate their growth, with the eventual goal of a sale to a trade buyer or an IPO. Typically they invest in "rounds" (A Round, B Round, etc.) and do so using preference shares (which usually have the right to convert to common stock on sale or IPO of the business, thus giving investors a degree of downside protection but full participation in the upside). Such investments are totally illiquid unless there is a realization event such as a sale of the business, which may take many years. Venture capital investing is a very risky area requiring specialized skills and generally should be avoided by anyone who cannot afford to lose all of their investment in a given company.&lt;ref name="VT" /&gt;

==Mutual funds==
The most attractive current products investing in preferreds are in the form of [[Exchange-traded funds|exchange traded funds]].

The open-end Vanguard Preferred Stock Fund,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?type=&amp;dateb=&amp;owner=include&amp;count=100&amp;action=getcompany&amp;CIK=0000081391| title=EDGAR Search Results - Vanguard Preferred Stock Fund| publisher=SEC| accessdate=June 27, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt; advised by Wellington Management Company, existed from 1975 until its liquidation in 2001. The reason for termination appears in the fund's semiannual report of April 2001. Vanguard liquidated the fund after a reduction in the intercorporate dividends-received deduction for preferred stock dividends and a corresponding severe drop-off in the issuance of eligible preferred stocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/81391/000093247101500184/preferred.txt| title=Vanguard(R) Preferred Stock Fund - Semiannual Report| date=April 30, 2001| publisher=SEC| accessdate=June 27, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''extended market index fund''', or '''completion index fund''', is a fund that, when combined with an S&amp;P 500 fund, "completes" the composition of the US total stock market.

Formally, a completion index is a sub-index of a Total U.S. Market Index which excludes the constituent stocks of the [[S&amp;P 500 index|S&amp;P 500 stock index]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/indices/equity/sp-completion-index-ci/#overview| title=S&amp;P Completion Index| publisher=S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices| accessdate=November 15, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/documents/methodologies/methodology-sp-us-indices.pdf| title=S&amp;P U.S. Indices Methodology| publisher=S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices| date=October 2023| accessdate=November 15, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Extended market index funds contain small-cap and mid-cap companies, but not large-cap companies listed in the S&amp;P 500 Index. These funds are designed for investors already using S&amp;P index funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{forum link| p=1918170| title=Re: total stock vs sp500 and extended market?| date=January 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Vanguard offers an [{{Vf | 0098}} Vanguard Extended Market Index Fund] (VEXMX for investor shares, VEXAX for Admiral shares, VXF for the ETF). Other companies offer similar "extended market index" or "completion index" funds. These funds hold all, or most, of the stocks not included in the S&amp;P 500 index.&lt;ref group="note"&gt; The first sentence in Vanguard's description says, vaguely: "Seeks to track the performance of a benchmark index that measures the investment return of stocks from small and midsize companies," but the second sentence goes on to make things clearer: "Provides a convenient way to match the performance of virtually all regularly traded U.S. stocks except those in the S&amp;P 500 Index." &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;

The formal statement of strategy and policy goes on to say its goal is to "track the performance of the Standard &amp; Poor’s Completion Index [which] contains all of the U.S. common stocks regularly traded on the New York and American Stock Exchanges, and the Nasdaq over-the-counter market, except those stocks included in the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500 Index."  The composition of the index (according to Morningstar as of 2/2012), consisted of 4% large-caps, 44% mid-caps, and 49% small-caps.  &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;

Similarly, the Fidelity Spartan Extended Market Index tracks the "Dow Jones U.S. Completion Total Stock Market Index," which contains the phrase "total market," and which  Dow Jones calls "A subset of the Dow Jones U.S. Total Stock Market Index that excludes components of the S&amp;P 500."&lt;/ref&gt;

==How to use an extended market fund==
Vanguard's [{{Vf | vexax}} product summary] says, in part:
{{blockquote|The fund is considered a complement to Vanguard 500 Index Fund. Together they provide exposure to the entire U.S. equity market.}}

Primarily then, you should use these funds if you want to invest in the total market, and would like to use a total stock market fund, but for whatever reason, find yourself cornered into holding a separate S&amp;P 500 index fund. There is no well-known investment theory that assigns any particular virtue to "the total market except for the S&amp;P 500" as an entity in itself. If you want to depart from total market weighting and choose your own proportion of large-cap stocks, you probably want to adjust mid-cap and small-cap exposure independently too.

The obvious reason why you would want the "Total Market with the S&amp;P 500 stocks removed" is that you already hold an S&amp;P 500 index fund. You might be constrained by limited choices in a 401(k) plan, or by existing holdings of an S&amp;P 500 fund in a taxable account that you cannot exchange without adverse tax consequences. Obviously, if you are not constrained to hold an S&amp;P 500 index fund, you can simply invest in a Total Stock Market index fund.

If you want to [[Approximating total stock market|duplicate the total market]] portfolio using an extended market fund, you should manage your portfolio to include the S&amp;P 500 fund and an Extended Market Index fund in about an 80%/20% proportion, and you will then essentially be holding the market. 

You may need to rebalance the 80%/20% ratio from time to time, and the ratio may change with the composition of the total market. You do not need to do this frequently or with scrupulous accuracy.

===Overlap and other niceties===
*Vanguard's Extended Market Index Fund tracks the Standard &amp; Poor's Completion Index, which is the S&amp;P Total Stock Market Index with the S&amp;P 500 stocks removed. So, if you add them back in the proper proportion (and rebalance as needed), the mix tracks S&amp;P Total Stock Market Index. Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund tracks a different index provider's Total Market index, the CRSP US Total Market Index, so in theory the results are not identical.
*Most or all "completion indexes" complete the S&amp;P 500. So, there is no overlap, no duplicated stocks in any mix of an S&amp;P 500 fund and a completion index fund.
*The S&amp;P 500 is mostly large-cap and often thought of as large-cap, but it is not a pure large-cap index. Therefore, a completion index is not a pure combination of mid- and small-caps. Furthermore, different index providers divide the market between between large, mid, and small in different ways. For example, this means that if you mix funds based on different index provider's indexes, there can be significant overlap between these providers' large cap index funds and an S&amp;P completion fund.&lt;ref group="note"&gt; For example, the most common MSCI index used for large cap stock index funds is the MSCI Prime market index, which is composed of the largest capitalization 750 stocks in the US market. The most commonly used Russell large cap index, the Russell 1000 index, is composed of the largest capitialization 1000 stocks in the US market.  Note that the Vanguard Total Market Index fund, based on the CRSP US Total Market Index  contains large cap, mid cap, small cap and micro cap stocks. The combination of Vanguard's Large Cap index fund and Vanguard's Small Cap fund (containing approximately 2400 market cap stocks) do not contain many micro cap stocks. The combination of an S&amp;P 500 index fund and an extended market index fund will contain large cap, mid cap, small cap, and micro cap stocks. Micro cap stocks comprise approximately 1.5% of the total market. &lt;/ref&gt;
*These are theoretical issues. The differences involved are small, and probably of concern only to purists.
*The extended market index is overweight in mid-cap growth. This is probably unimportant, but it does underline the fact that the extended market index is not the most suitable choice for fine control of "style box" weights in an overall portfolio.

====Mid-cap growth overweight====
[[file:Captura de pantalla 2016-08-01 a las 7.52.45 AM.png|thumb|Figure 2. Morningstar style box for VEXMX]]
[[file:Captura de pantalla 2016-08-01 a las 7.52.16 AM.png|thumb|Figure 3. Morningstar style box for VOO, which tracks the S&amp;P 500 index]]
The S&amp;P 500 is S&amp;P's choice of "leading companies in leading industries." In 1957 when the index was developed, it was intended to represent the whole market as seen by "normal" investors. Conventional wisdom at the time was that, in the language used by Benjamin Graham, "defensive investors" should limit themselves to "primary companies" in an industry.

It was not until the eighties that the conventional wisdom began to advocate small-caps, and not until the nineties that people began to think of value and growth as numerically defined categories whose weight should be consciously chosen. The S&amp;P 500's mid-cap holdings include an underweight to mid-cap growth that easily escapes notice because it is a small imbalance within the mid-caps which comprise only 13% of the S&amp;P 500.

Figure 2 and Figure 3 show Morningstar style boxes for Vanguard extended market and S&amp;P 500 funds. Notice the 11/13/21 imbalance in the first, and the deficit in mid-cap growth, 5/5/3, in the second.

===Dissenting views, and constrained choices in employer provided plans===
''Is an extended market index fund an appropriate tool for implementing a "small-cap tilt?"''

The natural way to implement a "[[Slice and dice|slice-and-dice]]" portfolio (dividing total stock market allocations into segments) is to use mutual funds that focus on and isolate the style factors; that is, funds that concentrate on one of the nine Morningstar [[Stock basics#Style Boxes | style boxes]]. With regard to size alone, it seems illogical to use a fund that covers mid-cap and small-cap stocks.

While index funds targeted to particular style boxes might be better in theory, [[Employer retirement plans overview|employer provided retirement plans]] frequently limit choices to actively managed funds with high expense ratios. If you want to depart from market cap weighting with regard to size alone, and you are limited by plan choices, you may find that a low cost extended market index fund is the lowest cost way to implement the strategy.

Often, when the actual behavior of real-world small-cap and mid-cap funds are examined, surprises emerge. For example, over a ten year period (2002-2012), the growth charts for the Vanguard Small-Cap Index Fund (NAESX), Mid-Cap Index Fund (VIMVX), and Extended Market Fund are almost superimposed -- it hardly seems to matter which was used.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;When examining historical Vanguard index fund returns, the transition of the indexes from one index provider to another can cause complications. Here are the transitions for Vanguard's index funds:
*Total Market Index: based on the Wilshire 5000 index (1992-2005); MSCI Broad Market Index (2005 - 2013); CRSP US Total Market Index (2013 - forward).
*Extended Market Index: based on the the Wilshire 4500 index (1987-2005); S&amp;P Completion Index (2005 - forward).
*Mid Cap Index: based on the S&amp;P 400 index  (1998- 2003); MSCI Mid Cap 450 (2005 - 2013); CRSP US Mid Cap Index (2013 - forward).
*Small Cap Index: based on the Russell 2000 index (1987-2003);  MSCI US Small Cap 1750 Index (2003- 2013); CRSP US Small Cap Index (2013 - forward). 
In addition, Vanguard currently offers the following funds that track the US mid cap and US small cap market sectors:
*US Mid Cap: 
:*Mid Cap Index Fund (CRSP US Mid Cap) mutual fund and ETF; 
:*S&amp;P Mid Cap 400 ETF.
*US Small Cap:
:* Small Cap Index Fund (CRSP US Small Cap) mutual fund and ETF; 
:*S&amp;P Small Cap 600 ETF and tax-managed mutual fund;
:* Russell 2000 ETF. 
There can be both annual and multiple year dispersion of returns between these index fund returns.
&lt;/ref&gt; 

A number of forum members feel that, regardless of theory, and regardless of the rationale behind the construction of a completion index; as a practical matter an extended market index fund can be a perfectly good way to provide a degree of small-cap tilt.&lt;ref&gt;{{forum link| t=92649| title=Now in wiki: Extended Market Index Funds}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' shows how you can combine funds to mimic the composition of the U.S. stock market.

Investors who want to invest in a Total Stock Market Index Fund often face a situation where they have to approximate it with the funds available in their employer sponsored plans, perhaps also using funds in other accounts, for example a [[Roth IRA]].

This page shows some examples of how to approximate a Total Stock Market Index Fund with funds that cover specific parts of the market.

==Total stock market index==
This table shows Total Stock Market Index Funds from four different providers. The aim is to approximate these Morningstar [[#Stock market classifications| style boxes]] using available funds chosen from the two-fund and three-fund tables below.

==Table notes==
For the above tables:

* The style box numbers were computed by [https://lt.morningstar.com/3y3wd9echv/xray/editholdings.aspx Morningstar Instant X-Ray] by entering each fund ticker as a holding, and entering the dollar value based on the percentage; for example, for VFIAX at 81% and VEXAX at 19%, enter $81 and $19 respectively and observe the computed Morningstar Style Box on the Instant X-Ray tab. Enter different dollar amounts (always adding up to $100) in a trial and error fashion until you replicate the same computation as Total Stock Market, or as close as you can get. You need a free (or paid) subscription to Morningstar to access Instant Xray.
* Computation used the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_squares method of least squares]
* If you are thinking of using an S&amp;P MidCap 400 fund, for example, you might consider the example above that uses IJH. However, there may be slight implementation differences between the S&amp;P MidCap 400 fund you have access to and IJH.
* Two funds may appear to track the same portion of the market (say, mid-cap), but their holdings may differ depending on the indexes they track.

==Stock market classifications==

===Style box format===

Style boxes use the following format. Numbers shown are percentages. Because values are rounded, the percentages may not total exactly 100%.

{{MStarStylebox| LV | LB | LG | MV | MB | MG | SV | SB | SG}}

===Size===

Stocks may be classified by the size of the corporation. This is most commonly done by market capitalization. [[Market capitalization]] is simply a measurement found by taking a stock's current share price and multiplying it by the number of stock shares outstanding.

Exact market cap ranges will vary among different financial and rating institutions, but there are three different terms commonly used to describe stocks by their general size. 

*'''Large cap stocks''' have a market cap over $10&amp;nbsp;billion.
*'''Mid cap stocks''' have a market cap between $2&amp;nbsp;billion and $10&amp;nbsp;billion.
*'''Small cap stocks''' have a market cap between $300&amp;nbsp;million and $2&amp;nbsp;billion.

The Morningstar style box uses percentages rather than fixed dollar thresholds for size classification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://news.morningstar.com/pdfs/FactSheet_StyleBox_Final.pdf| title=Fact sheet: The new Morningstar style box methodology| publisher=Morningstar| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220822012855/http://news.morningstar.com/pdfs/FactSheet_StyleBox_Final.pdf| archive-date=August 22, 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Style===

Stocks may also be classified by "style," one of '''Value''', '''Blend''', or '''Growth'''. 
* '''Growth stocks''' are companies that are growing their profits at a very fast rate and are expected to continue to grow at an increasing rate. 
* '''Value stocks''' are stocks that tend to trade at deep discount relative to their intrinsic value (as defined by profits, book value, and so on). 

Investors commonly think of growth stocks as "high flying companies" and value stocks as "distressed companies." Both growth and value stocks have taken turns leading and lagging one another during different markets and economic conditions.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;You can see the alternating performance of the growth and value stocks on the [[Callan periodic table of investment returns]], which visualizes performance of different asset classes.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''{{PAGENAME}}s '''are payments a corporation makes to its shareholders. [[Mutual fund]] dividends are distributions to a mutual fund shareholder, representing their share of interest and dividends the fund receives from the assets it holds.

==Stock dividends==
{{Quote
|quote = '''Dividends'''
A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings to its shareholders and is determined by the company's board of directors. Dividends are often distributed quarterly and may be paid out as cash or in the form of reinvestment in additional stock.&lt;br&gt;
The dividend yield is the dividend per share and is expressed as dividend/price as a percentage of a company's share price, such as 2.5%.&lt;br&gt;
Common shareholders of dividend-paying companies are eligible to receive a distribution as long as they own the stock before the ex-dividend date.
|source = —[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividend.asp Investopedia]
}}
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;Dividends are payments a corporation makes to its shareholders. It is the portion of corporate profits paid out to stockholders. When a corporation earns a profit or surplus, it can put that money to two uses: the business can either re-invest it (called retained earnings), or it can pay it to shareholders as a dividend. Many corporations retain a portion of their earnings and pay the remainder as a dividend.&lt;ref&gt;See also: [[wikipedia:Dividend | Dividend]], from Wikipedia&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, dividend payments are based on many factors, and decided by the corporation issuing the stock.&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

Deciding to invest in dividend paying stocks rather than stocks that do ''not'' pay dividends is uncertain at best. There are many reasons to support either position, as well as tax implications for both the issuing corporation and the stockholder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Fischer Black| title=The Dividend Puzzle| publisher=Journal of Portfolio Management, 2| date=1976| page=58| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o20jglECxf8C&amp;pg=PA74&amp;sig=tcAbLtZbMpgYzUpC90n6Joj1m-w#PPA10,M1| accessdate=December 13, 2023}} From Google Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mutual fund dividends==
When a mutual fund pays you a dividend, it is not a payment "for keeping your money in the fund for a year," but rather it is a net after expense distribution to you of your share of interest and dividends the fund received from the assets it holds. The fund must make these distributions, and it is required to decrease the [[net asset value]] (NAV) accordingly, because after paying a dividend the fund holds less wealth. This is true of most equity funds, but not of bond funds.

Your interest in holding a fund is the total return on your investment, which is increase in NAV plus value of distributions. If the fund NAV at the end of the year, after distributions, is actually less than the fund NAV at the beginning of the year, then the capital gain return for that year may have been negative. If you add to that the total of distributions received, the result may still be negative, or it may be positive.

Generally, you can expect both stock and bond funds to have a positive total return in a year, but your actual results in a year can vary widely, and do include negative total returns in some years.

===Dividend distributions===
{{See also|Why did my fund unexpectedly drop in value}}
Dividend distribution in a [[mutual fund]] represents not only bond interest but also stock dividends accumulated in the [[net asset value | NAV]] since the previous distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Forum link|t=48063|title=I don't understand how I made any money 2030 fund}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dividend distributions accumulate in the fund's [[net asset value | NAV]] throughout the year. Then when paid, the fund is reduced by that dividend amount. (This is not true of most Vanguard bond funds, as noted above. See [[net asset value]] (NAV) for more detail.) If you reinvest dividends, then you simply receive additional shares that equal the dividend amount times the number of shares you already owned.

You can think of these distributions as a bookkeeping tool to get stock dividends and bond interest income off the books and out to investors, either by reinvestment in additional shares or as a cash payment.

''For example:'' You own 500 shares at $11 per share at year-end, for a total worth of $5,500. There is a $1 per share dividend. Therefore, net of accumulated dividends in the fund, your fund is worth $10 per share. Assuming dividends are reinvested, you will get $500 ($1 x 500 shares) reinvested in the fund. $500 / $10 per share = 50 additional shares. Now you own 550 shares at $10 each, which equals your original $5,500.

Except for taxes in a taxable account, there is no reason to "time" the dividend in a mutual fund.

===Dividend distributions and fund prices===
If your fund is paying out a dividend or capital gains distribution (sometimes quarterly, often annually), its NAV will drop by the per share amount of the distributions on the ex-dividend date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://finance.zacks.com/happens-sell-dividend-paying-stock-after-receiving-dividend-1631.html| title=What Happens if You Sell a Dividend Paying Stock After Receiving a Dividend?| author=Kevin Johnston| publisher=Zacks.com| date=January 25, 2021| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240813190817/https://finance.zacks.com/happens-sell-dividend-paying-stock-after-receiving-dividend-1631.html| archive-date=August 13, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt; Your economic position does not change because of the distributions, regardless of whether you re-invest the distributions in the fund or take them in cash. Substantial drops in NAV from distributions most often occur in December, when many funds are paying annual dividend and capital gains distributions, especially if the distributions are large.

===Dates and timing===
There are four dates associated with dividends: &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ex-date.asp| title=Ex-Dividend Date: Definition, Key Dates, and Example| author=Jason Fernando| publisher=Investopedia| date=November 8, 2023| accessdate=December 13, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Declaration date''' - the company announces that it will be issuing a dividend in the future
*'''Record date''' - the company examines its current list of shareholders to determine who will receive dividends
*'''Ex-dividend date''' - this determines which of these shareholders will be entitled to receive the dividend
*'''Payable date''' - the dividend is actually paid to eligible shareholders

If you own shares on the record date, you will receive the dividend.

For mutual funds, the record date is one business day before the ex-dividend date. For ETFs, the record date is one business day after the ex-dividend date. The two day difference between mutual funds and ETFs is due to the two-day settlement period for ETFs (and stocks). Therefore, the following holds for both mutual funds and ETFs:

*If you buy shares on or after the ex-dividend date, you will not receive the dividend. If you buy shares before the ex-dividend date, you will receive the dividend.
*If you sell shares on or after the ex-dividend date, you will receive the dividend. If you sell shares before the ex-dividend date, you will not receive the dividend.

Vanguard says that their payable date will usually be two to four business days after the record date.&lt;ref&gt;For example: {{cite web| url={{Vf | vtsax}}| title=VTSAX distribution page| publisher=Vanguard.com| accessdate=December 13, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For mutual funds, Vanguard uses the term ''Reinvest date'' instead of ''Ex-dividend date''.

A '''mid cap''', a short form of middle capitalization, has a [[market capitalization]] in the middle of large caps and [[small caps]]. Although there is no standardized definition, it is generally accepted that mid caps are companies having a market capitalization of between two and ten billion dollars.
==Market capitalization==
{{Main|Market capitalization}}
Stocks may be classified by the size of the corporation. This is most commonly done looking at the market capitalization. Market Capitalization is simply a measurement found by taking a stock's current share price and multiplying it by the number of stock shares outstanding.

Exact market cap ranges will vary among different financial and rating institutions, but there are three different terms commonly used to describe stocks by their general size: Large Cap stocks; Mid Cap stocks; and Small Cap stocks. Market cap terms are relative and are constantly changing as companies get bigger and smaller.

{{Market cap table}}

In terms of the market size ranges spanned by mid-cap indexes, most mid cap stocks comprise the range below the 70% of the market capitalization occupied by large-caps and above the bottom 10% occupied by small-cap stocks.

Portfolio ''slice and dice'' is intended for &lt;u&gt;experienced investors only&lt;/u&gt;. It is not recommended for new investors, as it intentionally deviates from the Bogleheads approach to managing your portfolio, which is investing in the total market. Past performance does not guarantee future performance.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' means dividing your allocation within a given single [[Asset class | asset class]], such as [[Stock basics |stocks]]. Adding asset classes to a portfolio ([[Bond basics |bonds]],&lt;ref group="note"&gt;A bond is not a unitary asset class, because the segments of the bond market (that is, [[Treasury bonds|treasuries]], [[Corporate bonds|corporates]], [[Municipal bonds|municipals]], [[Asset-backed securities|asset-backed]], [[Mortgage-backed securities|mortgage securities]], [[Treasury Inflation Protected Securities|inflation indexed securities]], [[Zero-coupon bond|zero coupon]]) are all discrete. However, this restriction has been dropped over time (refer to the "[[#Usage|Usage]]" section).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gold |gold]], [[Commodities|commodities]]) is [[Asset allocation|asset allocation]], not slicing and dicing. ''Slice and dice'' portfolios are essentially diversified portfolios that aim to beat the broad market index by systematically overweighting various sectors.&lt;ref name="telltale"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://johncbogle.com/speeches/JCB_Morningstar_6-02.pdf| title=The Telltale Chart| author=John Bogle| author-link=John Bogle| date=June 26, 2002| accessdate=January 5, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its simplest form, the idea is to obtain excess returns by holding a portfolio that:&lt;ref name="telltale"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Paraphrased from the original text, as suggested by Barry Barnitz. See the [[Talk:Slice and dice | discussion tab]] above.&lt;/ref&gt;
:a) splits the market portfolio among sub-asset classes that are deemed likely to deliver superior returns;
:b) holds higher weightings of size and value sub-asset classes that have lower correlations with the market; and
:c) periodically rebalances each sub-asset class to its original weight. 

This contrasts with ''total stock market'' investing, which approximates the entire market as a single asset class.

The theoretical justification for ''slice and dice'' rests on the benefits of what is often called "diversification". However, in this context the word is used with a specific technical meaning. It refers to asset classes with low correlation coefficients. The benefit comes from the fact that a mixture of assets with low correlation will have better risk-adjusted returns than either of them taken by itself. A well-known example is that even though [[Domestic/International |international stocks]] are riskier than domestic stocks, adding a moderate amount of international stocks to domestic stocks slightly reduces the risk of the domestic stocks.&lt;ref name="nisi"&gt;{{forum link| p=853767| title=What is "Slice and Dice"?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
''Slice and dice'' is based on research by [[Eugene F. Fama]] and [[Kenneth R. French]] in their 1992 paper, ''The Cross Section of Expected Stock Returns'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.ivey.uwo.ca/media/3775518/the_cross-section_of_expected_stock_returns.pdf| title=The Cross Section of Expected Stock Returns| author1=Eugene F. Fama| author1-link=Eugene F. Fama| author2-link=Kenneth R. French| author2=Kenneth R. French| publisher=The Journal of Finance| date=June 1992| accessdate=January 5, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt; which introduced the [[Fama and French three-factor model | three factor model]]. By the mid and latter part of the nineties, investment advisors and some individuals began considering, and then implementing, portfolios based on the market, size, and value factors, compared to holding a "market cap" US stock index portfolio, such as the [[S&amp;P 500 index]] or a Total Market index.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;This section is based on an email from Barry Barnitz.&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally, the portfolio most widely used for theoretical discussion was the 4x25 ''slice and dice'', based on the "four corners" (quadrants) of the Fama and French three factor world: large growth, large value, [[Small caps | small growth, and small value]]. These quadrants are created by splitting the stocks as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.efficientfrontier.com/ef/702/3FM-10.htm| title=The Cross-Section of Expected Stock Returns| author=William Bernstein| author1-link=William Bernstein| publisher=Efficient Frontier| accessdate=January 5, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Split vertically: "Large" is size deciles one through five of the CRSP (Center for Research in Security Prices) database,&lt;ref group="note" name="crsp" /&gt; and "Small," deciles six through ten.
*Split horizontally: "Value" and "Growth" are defined as the bottom and top 30% of stocks sorted by price/book.

Advisors and portfolio theorists arguing for ''slice and dice'' (including [[William Bernstein]], [[Larry Swedroe]], and Jeff Troutner) considered market cap indexes as dominated by growth stocks and were used as the growth proxies in ''slice and dice'' portfolios.

As an example, a four quadrant ''slice and dice'' portfolio consisting of S&amp;P indexes (available in the late 1990s or early 2000s) would have consisted of the following:

*S&amp;P 500 (25%)
*S&amp;P 500 Value (25%)
*S&amp;P 600 (25%)
*S&amp;P 600 Value (25%)

This 4x25 allocation is the scheme [[John Bogle]] analysed in his "Telltale Chart" address to the [[Bogleheads® convention meetings#Diehards III - Chicago | Bogleheads reunion]] in 2002 (Morningstar Investment Forum at that time).&lt;ref name="telltale"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In practice, this original 4x25 allocation scheme shifted over time to allow more value tilted allocations, and allocations more closely tied to an individual's risk profile. The [[Talk:Slice and dice | discussion tab (above)]] contains a brief summary of ''slice and dice'' portfolios from several [[:Category:Bogleheads authors |bogleheads authors]], beginning in 1999.

The 4x25 allocation template shows up in some of the "expert" [[Lazy Portfolios | lazy portfolios]]. The following three portfolios all follow the 4x25 pattern, although one shows an increased value tilt.

*[[Lazy portfolios#Bill Schultheis's "Coffeehouse" portfolio | William Schulteis's "Coffeehouse" portfolio]]
*[[Lazy portfolios#William Bernstein's "Coward's" portfolio | William Bernstein's "Coward's" portfolio]] - note: Total Stock Market approximates 10% large, 5% mid/small
*[[Lazy portfolios#Frank Armstrong's "Ideal Index" portfolio | Frank Armstrong's "Ideal Index" portfolio]] - employs a modest value tilt

==Approach==
As mentioned previously, ''slice and dice'' breaks the total stock market into four segments defined as large growth, large value, small growth and small value stocks. Similar to the [[Stock Basics#Style Boxes | equity style boxes]], the vertical segments (large and small) are based on the decile rankings by the Chicago Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP) which breaks down the market into 10 slices containing equal numbers of companies.From &lt;ref group="note" name="crsp"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.crsp.com/products/capbased.html| title=CRSP Cap-Based Portfolio Indices| publisher=CRSP}}:{{dead link}}
# Ranks all NYSE companies by market capitalization and divides them into ten equally populated portfolios.
# Places Amex and NASDAQ stocks into the deciles determined by the NYSE breakpoints, based on market capitalization
# The series of 10 indices are identified as CRSP 1 through CRSP 10, where CRSP 10 has the largest population and smallest market-capitalization.
# CRSP portfolios 1-2 represent large cap stocks, portfolios 3-5 represent mid-caps, portfolios 6-8 represent small caps, and portfolios 9-10 represent micro-caps.
# The portfolios are rebalanced quarterly and total return, capital appreciation return, and income return are calculated on a monthly basis. 

[http://www.crsp.com/crsp/about/history.html About CRSP]:{{dead link}} The Chicago Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP), part of the University of Chicago’s Booth School of Business, maintains a database giving a strong foundation for economic forecasting, stock market research, and financial analyses to academic institutions, investment banks, brokerage firms, corporations, banks, and government agencies. Eighty percent of academic research in stock market and investment analysis uses CRSP data as a source due to the completeness and accuracy of the information.&lt;/ref&gt; To determine whether they are "growth" or "value" (horizontal segments), companies are divided according to their risk or volatility levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ifa.com/articles/Slice_and_Dice_Primer.aspx| title=Slice and Dice Primer| publisher=Index Fund Advisors| date=August 10, 2000| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190117214718/https://www.ifa.com/articles/Slice_and_Dice_Primer/| archive-date=January 17, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Slice and dice'' is based on the approach that small cap stocks and value stocks are associated with risk premiums. Weighting a portfolio in favor of small cap stocks and value stocks increases its volatility and therefore return over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.indexfunds.com/articles/20000403_slice_com_veh_JT.htm| title=In Defense of "Slice and Dice"| author=Jeff Troutner| publisher=Index Funds Advisors| date=2004| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040803114618/http://www.indexfunds.com/articles/20000403_slice_com_veh_JT.htm| archive-date=August 3, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those advocating the ''total stock market'' approach emphasize tax efficiency, simplicity, and the advantages of owning the total market.&lt;ref&gt;{{forum link| p=853494| title=Dreman Criticizes Fama/French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, a "total market" investor might be satisfied with a two-fund portfolio that approximates the entire market; that is, Total Stock Market Index and Total Bond Market Index.

A ''slice and dice'' investor would use more than one stock fund, such as [[Lazy Portfolios#Bill Schultheis's "Coffeehouse" portfolio | William Schulteis's "Coffeehouse portfolio"]], which allocates stocks with six equal "slices": Small-Cap Value Index, REIT Index, Total International Stock Index, Index (S&amp;P) 500, Value Index, and Small-Cap Index.&lt;ref name="nisi" /&gt;

''Slice and dice'' is more complex than a "total market" approach, because ''slice and dice'' portfolios need more attention and more frequent rebalancing than simpler portfolios. The debate boils down to how large the benefit is, whether it is possible to prove unequivocally that there really is a benefit, and, even if so, whether it is worth the effort.&lt;ref name="nisi" /&gt;

==Usage==
The definitions above have evolved over time to include additional asset classes, such as commodities or non-investment-grade [[High yield bonds |("high-yield") bonds]]. The definition of "asset class" is flexible and varies from authority to authority.&lt;ref name="nisi" /&gt;

''Slicing'' is used to divide an asset class or portfolio in one dimension.&lt;ref&gt;{{forum link| p=854113| title=What is "Slice and Dice"?}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*A sliced portfolio: stocks, bonds, cash

''Slice and dice'' divides an asset in two or more dimensions.
*A diced portfolio: stocks (domestic and international); bonds (domestic and foreign); cash ([[CD]]s denominated in US and other currencies).

Stocks are divided into two dimensions in a manner similar to the [[Stock Basics#Style Boxes | equity style boxes]]. The vertical ''slice'' splits the asset into value and growth, the horizontal ''dice'' (second cut) splits the asset into size (market cap).

International stocks can be divided according to regions. For splitting allocations along regional axes see: [[Slice and dice international]]. International stocks can also be ''sliced and diced'' along the four quadrants of the Fama and French three factor model using exchange traded funds. iShares offers developed market funds based on MSCI international indexes with large blend, large value, small blend and small value splits.

On the bond side, investors can ''slice and dice'' a bond portfolio into different "term" and "credit" exposures relative to a total bond index (or hold them in the same percentages, but still hold them separately to better control their allocation to each dimension).&lt;ref group="note"&gt;From email send by member SmallHi.&lt;/ref&gt; (Refer to the [[Bond basics#Style boxes | fixed income style boxes]], which ''slice'' vertically as "credit risk" and ''dice'' horizontally as "term" or duration.)

What ''slice and dice'' is not: if you slice the total world market into pieces and hold each piece in the proportion it represents of the total world market, then you still hold the total world market. There is no tilt and no slice.&lt;ref&gt;{{forum link| p=854188| title=What is "Slice and Dice"?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tilt===
[[Value tilting - stock | Tilting]] is sometimes associated with ''slice and dice'', as both approaches overweight small cap and/or value stocks compared to the total stock market.&lt;ref&gt;{{forum link| p=853682| title=What is "Slice and Dice"?}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, tilting and ''slice and dice'' are completely different concepts.

Tilting does require allocation according to a ''slice and dice'' model. However, tilting alters the allocation across asset classes, while ''slice and dice'' only specifies that the asset classes are managed explicitly and are fixed.

Tilting means a preference for some asset classes or for some factor loading that is different from the total market of a particular asset class, usually US equities.&lt;ref&gt;{{forum link| p=853647| title=What is "Slice and Dice"?}}&lt;/ref&gt; Multifactor (multi-factor) investing uses this approach.

==John Bogle's own view==
[[John Bogle]] gives an interesting, nuanced, and skeptical view in "The Telltale Chart",&lt;ref name="telltale" /&gt; based on a 2002 speech, and included in his 2010 book ''Don't Count On It!'' The main point of the essay is that many popular investment approaches that are often believed to have superior performance, only do so for a while before succumbing to "reversion to the mean" (RTM). His examples include small-cap stocks, value stocks, and "slice and dice" portfolios. (It is commendable that he updated all the charts to 2009 for inclusion in the book, even though many of the assets and portfolios he charts did well recently, undercutting his point).

{{for|additional information|wikipedia:Business Development Company}}

A '''business development company''' (BDC) is a company designed to help grow small and midsize companies (mostly privately owned companies). These companies are similar to venture capital funds, but are public [[stock]]s listed on the New York and NASDAQ stock exchanges. BDCs were created by Congress in  the Small Business Incentive Act of 1980.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bdcreporter.com/ BDC Reporter]&lt;/ref&gt; To qualify as a regulated BDC, companies must be registered in compliance with Section 54 of the Investment Company Act of 1940. They are similar in structure to [[closed-end funds]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bdc.asp Investopedia]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==

A BDC usually invests in privately held companies in three ways:
#By offering [[debt security|debt financing]] to the company.
#By offering equity financing to the company by taking an equity stake in the company.
#By taking an active consultancy role in the management of a company. 

BDCs roughly fall into three types:

*'''Growth focused''': These BDCs resemble venture capital funds. They invest mostly equity capital in early development stage companies which usually have limited operating histories.
*'''Value focused''' : These BDCs invest in companies with more established operating histories than do growth focused BDCs.
*'''Income focused''': An income focused BDC primarily makes loans to later stage companies. The loans often are accompanied with warrants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sutherland.com/file_upload/BDCPresentation081706.pdf Overview of the Business Development Company]&lt;/ref&gt;

BDCs are similar to [[real estate investment trust]]s (REITs) in that they must distribute 90% of investment income. Distributed income and capital gains are not taxed at the corporate level but are assessed to the individual shareholder when distributed. BDCs usually have high [[dividend]] yields. These dividends (primarily representing interest on loans) are considered ordinary income and are not qualified dividend, which under current tax law are taxed at lower rates. However, any dividends that a BDC receives from a stock investment and distributes to shareholders can be a [[qualified dividend]].

A BDC is limited to 1:1 [[:Leverage | leverage]]. This means that a BDC with $100 of equity can borrow a maximum $100 dollars and invest $200 in businesses&lt;ref&gt;[http://bdcreporter.com/primer-on-bdc-industry/why-invest-in-bdcs/ BDC Reporter: Why Invest in a BDC?]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mutual funds and BDCs==
{{Quote
|quote     = &lt;u&gt;Regulation&lt;/u&gt;

To be treated as a "regulated investment company" (RIC) under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code a BDC must:
* Qualify as a regulated investment company.
*Distribute to stockholders in a timely manner at least 90% of their "investment company taxable income," as defined in the Internal Revenue Code -- this rule similar to that of REITs means BDCs are typically high yielding stocks.

A BDC will receive an exempt status on the 4% nondeductible federal excise tax if they distribute to their shareholders:
*98% of their ordinary income for each calendar year, and
* 98% of their capital gain net income for the one-year period ending December 31 in that calendar year, and
* Any income not distributed in prior years.

In order to qualify as a regulated investment company for federal income tax purposes, the BDC must, among other things:
* Continue to qualify as a business development company under the 1940 Act.
* Derive in each taxable year at least 90% of their gross income from dividends, interest, payments with respect to securities loans, gains from the sale of stock or other securities, or other income derived with respect to their business of investing in such stock or securities (the "90% Income Test").
*Diversify their holdings so that at the end of each quarter of the taxable year:
- At least 50% of the value of their assets consists of cash, cash items, U.S. government securities, securities of other regulated investment companies, and other securities if such other securities of any one issuer do not represent more than 5% of their assets or more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of the issuer.

- No more than 25% of the value of their assets is invested in the securities (other than U.S. government securities or securities of other regulated investment companies) of any one issuer or of two or more issuers that are controlled (as determined under applicable Internal Revenue Code rules) by the BDC and are engaged in the same or similar or related trades or businesses (the "Diversification Tests''). 
|source    = -- ''[http://www.valueforum.com/bdcs/intro/ Introduction to BDCs]''
}}
A BDC can be either internally managed by its staff or externally managed by hiring an investment advisor. An internally managed BDC does not pay advisory fees. It pays the operating costs of the business.

An externally managed BDC has an investment advisor and pays advisory fees. Approximately half of all BDCs are now externally managed.&lt;ref&gt; [http://bdcreporter.com/primer-on-bdc-industry/ BDC Reporter: A Primer on BDCs]&lt;/ref&gt; The advisory fee of externally managed BDCs typically runs between 1.75% to 2.50% per annum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mofo.com/files/Uploads/Documents/FAQ-Business-Development-Companies.pdf FAQ Business Development Company]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to a base fee, the advisor is permitted by law to receive an incentive performance fee up to a maximum 20% of a BDC’s realized capital gains net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation over a specified period.&lt;ref group="note"&gt; From [http://www.mofo.com/files/Uploads/Documents/FAQ-Business-Development-Companies.pdf FAQ Business Development Company]. Example incentive performance fee:
*0% of all net investment income earned at or below a “hurdle rate” of 7%;
*100% of all net investment income earned above the 7% hurdle rate but below a “catch-up rate” of 8.75%; and
*20% of all net investment income earned above the 8.75% “catch-up rate.” &lt;/ref&gt;

The SEC mandates that a mutual fund must account for the expenses of a BDC as an [[:Acquired fund fees|"acquired expense"]].  Here is a list of [[Acquired_fund_fees_and_expenses#Vanguard_funds_and_BDCs|Vanguard fund expenses adjusted for BDC costs]].

{{quotation|SEC rules nevertheless require that any expenses incurred by a BDC be included in a fund’s expense ratio as "Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses." The expense ratio of a fund that holds a BDC will need to overstate what the fund actually spends on portfolio management, administrative services, and other shareholder services by an amount equal to these Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses. The Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses do not impact a fund’s total return or index tracking error and are not included in a fund’s financial statements, which provide a clearer picture of a fund's actual operating expenses.|Vanguard&lt;ref&gt;[https://personal.vanguard.com/us/insights/article/bdc-expense-ratios-04292011 Vanguard: Business development companies: What you need to know]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Index exclusion===
By 2014 a majority of major index providers removed BDCs from their US indexes.

A '''stock''' share (also known as an equity share) represents ownership in a corporation.

The two familiar types of stock shares are "common stock" and "[[preferred stock]]." Owners of common stock typically have voting rights to elect board members of the corporation. In some cases, such as Ford Motors, there are two (or more) types of common stock. One class has the right to vote and the other does not. The Ford family created this dual-share class in such a way that they were able to maintain control of the company without being fully exposed to its risk as an actual majority shareholder.

Preferred stock typically has no voting rights but is legally entitled to dividends before other shareholders. Holding common stock in a corporation allows a shareholder the right to receive dividends from the company, and gives the shareholder a right to the company's assets during bankruptcy liquidation, though not before all creditors have been paid first. Holding stock may result in capital appreciation, as the demand for the stock goes up as the company grows its profits.

For a very basic introduction to stocks, start with the [[#Tutorial | tutorial]] at the bottom of this page.

==Buying and selling==

You can purchase individual stock through either direct investment with the company (through a dividend reinvestment plan, for example), or through a brokerage account. Buying and selling through a brokerage account usually involves a commission paid to the broker. Many discount brokerages offer commissions under $20, and some even offer free commissions for certain situations. Full service brokerages can charge anywhere from $50 to $200 a trade depending on their rates, the number of shares purchased, and how often you trade a stock.

When you place an [[Orders | order]] to buy or sell stock, you might not think about where or how your broker will execute the trade. But where and how your [[Orders | order]] is executed can impact the overall costs of the transaction, including the price you pay for the stock.&lt;ref name=SEC"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/tradexec.htm| title=Trade Execution| publisher=SEC| date=January 16, 2013| accessdate=August 13, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
While trade execution is usually seamless and quick, it does take time. And prices can change quickly, especially in fast-moving markets. Because price quotes are only for a specific number of shares, investors may not always receive the quoted price. By the time your order reaches the market, the price of the stock could be slightly – or very – different. No SEC regulations require a trade to be executed within a set period of time.

Just as you have a choice of brokers, your broker generally has a choice of markets to execute your trade such as: a specific stock exchange, a regional exchange, or a market maker.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;A "market maker" is a firm that stands ready to buy and sell a particular stock on a regular and continuous basis at a publicly quoted price. For more, see: [http://www.sec.gov/answers/mktmaker.htm Market Maker], from Investor.gov.&lt;/ref&gt; When deciding how to execute orders, your broker has a duty to seek the best execution that is reasonably available for its customers' orders.

==Classification of common stocks==

===Country===
One classification of stocks is the country where the corporation is headquartered. Knowing where a stock trades is important because international investments can provide a diversification benefit to a portfolio invested solely in the domestic market.

All else being equal, you should see a diversification benefit from investing internationally because the equity markets in other economies are less-than-perfectly correlated with your own domestic equity market. However, investing in foreign markets also exposes you to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. In the long term, currency movements should have no impact on the returns of a foreign portfolio, but in the short term these fluctuations can significantly impact both your portfolio volatility and your returns.

Stocks trade on stock exchanges all over the world, and trading stocks on an exchange in a different country from your own usually results in higher costs to buy and sell. This expense is greater if the company is located in a smaller or more underdeveloped country where the stock may not get traded frequently, resulting in even higher transaction costs.

In the U.S., an American Depository Receipt (more commonly known as ADR) is a type of stock traded on U.S. exchanges that represents ownership of a non-U.S. corporation. ADRs allow U.S. investors the ability to more easily and cheaply buy stock in corporations from many countries.

A representative global index such as the [[S&amp;P Global Broad Market Index]] illustrates the breakdown of the global equity market by country.

===Sector===
Stocks may also be classified by the sector of business or industry where the corporation makes its revenue and profits. MSCI and S&amp;P have created the widely used [https://www.msci.com/gics GICS global system of business sectors]. This divides companies into four levels: 11 sectors, 24 industry groups, 69 industries, and 158 sub-industries. The eleven sectors are:

{| class=wikitable style="text-align:center"

===Size===
Stocks may be classified by the size of the corporation. This is most commonly done by [[market capitalization]]. This is simply a value calculated by taking a stock's current share price and multiplying it by the number of stock shares outstanding.

Exact market cap ranges will vary among different financial and rating institutions, but there are three different terms commonly used to describe stocks by their general size:

*'''Large capitalization stocks''': Large cap stocks have a market cap over $10 billion dollars.
*'''Mid capitalization stocks''': Mid cap stocks have a market cap between $2 billion and $10 billion dollars.
*'''Small capitalization stocks''': Small cap stocks have a market cap between $300 million and $2 billion dollars.

While these are the most common market cap references, there are also some less commonly used: mega cap, micro cap, and nano cap. Market cap terms are relative and change constantly as companies get bigger and smaller.

===Style===

Stocks may also be classified by "style," either value, blend, or growth. Growth stocks are companies that are growing their profits at a very fast rate and are expected to continue to grow at an increasing rate. Value stocks are stocks that tend to trade at a deep discount relative to their intrinsic value (as defined by profits, book value, and so on). Investors commonly perceive growth stocks as "high flying companies" and value stocks as "distressed companies."

Both growth and value stocks have taken turns leading and lagging one another during different markets and economic conditions.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The [[Callan periodic table of investment returns]] that visualises the performance of the different asset classes. In it, you can see the alternating performance of the growth and value stocks.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Risks==
[[File:Stock market risk.gif|thumb|right|Figure 1. Risk vs. return&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.duke.edu/~charvey/Classes/ba350/history/history.htm| title=Historical Behavior of Asset Returns| publisher=Duke University| accessdate=August 13, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Stocks are subject to the following risks: 
*'''Business risk''' -- A measure of risk associated with a particular security. It is also known as unsystematic risk and refers to the risk associated with a specific issuer of a security. A common way to avoid unsystematic risk is to diversify - that is, to buy mutual funds, which hold the securities of many different companies.
*'''Financial risk''' -- Risk due to the capital structure of a firm. Corporate debt magnifies financial risk.
*'''Liquidity risk''' -- The risk that an asset cannot be sold when desired due to a thin market.
*'''Market risk''' -- Systematic risk faced by all equity investors due to market volatility. This risk can not be diversified away. This is the type of risk most people are referring to when they casually use the term "risk" with respect to investments, without qualification.
*'''Political risk''' -- Risk to an investment due to changes in the law or political regime. Potential changes in tax law or changes in a country's structure of governance are sources of political risk.

In addition to these risks, international stocks are subject to currency risk.

As Figure 1 illustrates, these risks result in considerable volatility of returns.
&lt;br style="clear: both" /&gt;

==Role in a portfolio==
{{Main|Asset allocation}}
An investment in stocks gives you an ownership stake in the profitability of corporate business enterprise. By receiving the dividends and potential long term appreciation of equity value, you participate in the growth potential of capitalism. A diversified portfolio of stocks, invested for the long term, can provide a portfolio with an asset that has the potential to grow over time.

===Style boxes===
Style boxes are based on the [[Fama and French three-factor model#Categorizing portfolios | Fama and French three-factor model]]. They are 3&amp;nbsp;x&amp;nbsp;3 grids that categorize securities. Different investment styles have various levels of risk which leads to differences in returns. This visualization allows investors to compare securities using an easy-to-understand standardized format.
 
For equities (stocks and stock funds), securities are classified by [[Market capitalization | market capitalization]] ("market cap") on the vertical axis, and value and growth factors on the horizontal axis.

Morningstar introduced the Style Box&amp;trade; in 1992 to help investors determine the investment style of a fund.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://news.morningstar.com/pdfs/FactSheet_StyleBox_Final.pdf| title=Fact Sheet: The New Morningstar Style Box&amp;trade; Methodology| publisher=Morningstar| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220822012855/http://news.morningstar.com/pdfs/FactSheet_StyleBox_Final.pdf| archive-date=August 22, 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other fund providers, such as Vanguard, also use style boxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://personal.vanguard.com/us/FundsStyleBox| title=Vanguard Funds by Style Box| publisher=Vanguard| accessdate=August 13, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Do not compare Vanguard's style box to Morningstar, as they have very different criteria for box style composition. See {{Forum link| t=68058| title=9-style box - Vanguard vs M*}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Equity style boxes (stock funds) and [[Bond basics#Style boxes | fixed income style boxes]] (bond funds) represent two-dimensional (horizontal and vertical axis) views of risk versus return. However, the background behind these boxes is based on very different concepts. '''Only compare stocks-to-stocks and bonds-to-bonds.'''

Both equity and fixed income style boxes are a way to visualize how diversified your portfolio is with respect to the main characteristic of each asset class - size and value for equities; [[Bond basics#Credit risk | credit risk]] and [[Bond basics#Interest rate risk| term risk]] for fixed income.&lt;ref&gt;{{Forum link| p=757434| title=Style boxes - Why the differences? Some questions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, you are interested in [https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/tools/stylebox?View=Fund&amp;Cat=Domestic_Balanced_Balanced Vanguard's balanced funds], which contain both stock and bond funds. The style boxes show you a simple collection of colored boxes, and this can make asset allocation decisions easier.
