One way of tracking it is with a net worth statement. You might also want to prepare statements that value your estate for any [[Estate and inheritance tax| estate tax]], as well as a statement showing the amount [[Probate#The probate estate |subject to probate]].

==Net worth statements==
A net worth statement shows the market value of your assets, and how much you owe in debts, at a particular time. (This is different from an income statement or a budget.) For example, you might create a net worth statement for yourself as of December 31, 2022. The difference between the total value of your assets and the total of your debts is your net worth.&lt;ref name="FINRA"&gt; {{cite web| url=http://www.saveandinvest.org/web/groups/foundation/@foundation/documents/foundation/p118408.pdf| title=Personal Financial Statements| publisher=The Center for Financial Studies, South New Hampshire University, FINRA Investor Education Foundation| date=2010| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150218162402/http://www.saveandinvest.org:80/web/groups/foundation/@foundation/documents/foundation/p118408.pdf| archive-date=February 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reasons for creating a net worth statement include:&lt;ref name="FINRA" /&gt;
* To check your progress towards your financial goals
* To plan for changes in assets or liabilities
* To minimize your tax liability
* To estimate how well your dependents could live off an inheritance if you were to die in the near future
* To determine how much life and property insurance you need
* As a reminder to adjust your insurance coverage or assets
* To estimate your retirement savings progress

===Assets===
For U.S. citizens, assets in your net worth statement might include:
* Your checking and savings accounts balances, and the balance of any [[CD]]s
* The market value of [[Stock basics|stocks]], [[Bond basics|bonds]], and [[mutual fund]]s and [[Exchange-traded funds]] (ETFs) in investment accounts
* The current value of any [[401(k)]], [[IRA]], and similar retirement plans
* The market value of your home, and any other residential or rental real-estate
* Cash value of insurance or pensions
* Market value of personal property: for example cars, furniture, and jewelry
* Other assets: for example, business related assets, such as business value and notes receivable

===Liabilities===
Your liabilities would include:
* Credit card balances
* Lines of credit balances
* Car loan balances
* Mortgage balances
* Student loan balances
* Other debts
* Taxes due

The following table shows an example net worth statement.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The net worth is calculated as: Net worth = (Total assets) - (Total liabilities). That is, $170,000 = $397,000 - $227,000.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Notice|
Financial planners who manage investments act as an [[Investment adviser | investment adviser]] (sometimes referred to as a ''financial advisor''). Be sure you understand this distinction. If you are unsure, please ask in the forum for advice.}}

A '''financial planner''', or personal financial planner, is someone whose job is to create financial plans for their clients. Plans cover many elements of personal finance, including cash flow management, and planning for education, retirement, investments, risk management and insurance, tax, estate. Also, for business owners, business succession planning.

The work a financial planner does is (unsurprisingly) known as personal financial planning. A financial planner uses a detailed process to create a financial plan, one that is tailored to a client's specific situation, and aims to meet a client's specific goals. A financial planner considers their client's entire financial and life situation, and the ways in which the separate aspects of these affect each other.

For more, see also [[wikipedia:Financial planner|Financial planner]], from Wikipedia, and [https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/investing-basics/glossary/financial-planners Financial Planners], from the SEC.

==Financial planning==
Financial planning gives your financial decisions direction and meaning. It lets you understand how each financial decision you make affects other areas of your finances. For example, buying a particular investment product might help you pay off your mortgage faster, or it might significantly delay your retirement. By looking at each financial decision as part of a whole, you can consider its short and long-term effects on your life goals. You can also adapt more easily to life changes, and feel more secure that your goals are on track.

When hiring a financial planner, you should know exactly what services you need, what services the planner can deliver, and any limitations on what they can recommend. You should understand what services you are paying for, how much those services cost, and how the planner gets paid. Financial planners charge for their services in different ways. Some charge either a fixed fee or an hourly fee for the time it takes to develop a financial plan, but do not sell investment products. Some are paid by commissions on the products they sell. Others use a combination of fees and commissions.

Financial planners who give investment advice to their clients must register with the SEC or the appropriate state securities regulator.

==Financial planner credentials==
Financial planners may come from many different educational and professional backgrounds. If you are considering using a financial planner, be sure to ask about their background. If they have a credential, ask them what it means and what they had to do to earn it.

Some financial planners assess every aspect of your financial life — including saving, investments, insurance, taxes, retirement, and estate planning — and help you develop a detailed strategy or financial plan to meet all your financial goals. Other professionals call themselves financial planners, but they may only be able to recommend that you invest in a narrow range of products, and sometimes products that are not securities.

For a detailed breakdown of this veritable alphabet soup of credentials, see FINRA's list of [https://www.finra.org/investors/professional-designations professional designations]. This offers an extensive list of the many designations that investment professionals use.
{{Notice|
''Financial Analyst'', ''Financial Adviser (Advisor)'', ''Financial Consultant'', ''Financial Planner'', ''Investment Consultant'' or ''Wealth Manager'' are generic terms or job titles, and investment professionals who may not hold any specific designation can use them.}}

==Do I need a financial planner?==
You can of course do your own financial planning. However, they may be some situations in which you need professional help. For example:
*You need expertise you do not have in certain areas of your finances. For example, adjusting your retirement plan due to changing family circumstances.
*You want a professional opinion on the financial plan you developed for yourself.
*You lack the spare time to do this yourself.
*You have an immediate need or unexpected life event such as a birth, inheritance or major illness.
*You feel that a professional adviser could help you improve on how you are currently managing your finances.
*You know that you need to improve your current financial situation, but do not know where to start.

==Certified Public Account (CPA)==
A CPA, or Certified Public Accountant, is a trusted financial advisor who helps people, businesses, and other organizations plan and reach their financial goals.&lt;ref name="AICPA"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.aicpa.org/becomeacpa/gettingstarted/frequentlyaskedquestions.html |title= Frequently Asked Questions FAQs - Become a CPA| website=American Institute of CPAs |publisher= American Institute of CPAs|accessdate= August 30, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All CPAs are accountants, but not all accountants are Certified Public Accountants (CPAs). The main differences between accountants and CPAs are education, experience, and opportunity.&lt;ref name="AICPA" /&gt;

The Personal Financial Specialist (PFS) credential allows CPAs to demonstrate their knowledge and expertise in personal financial planning. CPA/PFS credential holders have a specific experience, education and examination requirement that sets them apart from other CPAs and financial planners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.aicpa.org/membership/join/credentials.html?tab-1=3|title= CPA/PFS Overview|website=American Institute of CPAs |publisher= American Institute of CPAs|accessdate= August 30, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background checks==
Organizations which certify financial planners maintain a directory of their members. You can verify a financial planner's credentials as follows:

* CFA charterholder: Use the CFA's [https://www.cfainstitute.org/membership/directory Member Directory] to verify a person’s status as a CFA charterholder and member of the CFA Institute. You can find a member's professional conduct status by following the link on the directory's page.
* CFP® certification: The CFP's [https://www.cfp.net/verify-a-cfp-professional Verify a CFP Professional] search identifies people who currently hold CFP certification, as well as people who are not currently certified but who held CFP certification at one time. The search results will show any disciplinary actions or bankruptcy filings within the past ten years.

You can verify a CFP's or Personal Financial Specialist's credentials with the American Institute of CPAs' [https://us.aicpa.org/forthepublic/findacpa License Verification] web page.&lt;ref&gt;{{Forum link|title = Re: Larry Swedroe: Long/Short Portfolios &amp; Taxes |p=4244998 |date=December 5, 2018|author = Greenman72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A budget can help you plan for things you want to buy, and establish savings to reach your personal financial goals. Budgets are often essential for people who want to keep their spending under control. If you are approaching retirement, tracking your income and expenses can help you [[Budget models of retirement spending|determine the income you need to plan your retirement]].

A budget can be ''descriptive'', where it simply tracks your household's cash flows&lt;ref group="note"&gt; The Department of Labor conducts surveys to determine how US consumers spend their income. These are examples of a descriptive budget:

|}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''prescriptive'', where you create a budget (a plan of future spending), and then control your income and spending to match this budget.

==Living below your means==
{{Main|Living below your means}}
Perhaps the most important idea underlying the Bogleheads approach to investing is recognizing you need to save a significant portion of income every month to have enough money for a comfortable retirement. ''There is no substitute for spending less than you earn.''

The Bogleheads approach to developing a workable financial plan is to have a sensible household budget - one that covers needed spending, discretionary pleasures, savings for big-ticket items, and savings for long-term retirement planning. Avoid excess [[debt]], such as [[credit cards]] and home equity loans. If you have this type of debt, pay off those balances first. Reduce expenses and unneeded debt so you can consistently set aside a portion of earnings for decades. If you do not save enough, no amount of financial trickery will give you the returns you need for a comfortable retirement. 

== The process of budgeting ==
Budget worksheets are available from many sources. Choose a format that you are comfortable with. The example below illustrates the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://debittracker.com/MoneySmart/InfoBooth/089.htm| title=Sample Income and Expenses Worksheet| publisher=Money Smart Information Booth| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161104160457/http://debittracker.com/MoneySmart/InfoBooth/089.htm| archive-date=November 4, 2016| accessdate=June 6, 2023}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Income===
Record your income in the left column. As you can see from the example below, there are spaces on your worksheet for other income sources that might fit your personal situation. As you record your income, be sure to consider whether income sources are continuous or whether they might stop in the near future. For example, if you receive unemployment benefits, keep in mind when you will stop receiving these benefits.

You also might want to make adjustments for income you receive on a yearly or quarterly basis, such as tax refunds or bonus checks.

Calculate your total income by adding the numbers in the left column. This number represents the amount of income you receive in a month.

===Expenses===
Next, list your monthly expenses in the right-hand column.

'''Fixed expenses:''' 
Begin by listing your fixed expenses. Fixed expenses are items you have little or no control over. You will pay a fixed amount for these expenses each month.

'''Flexible expenses:'''
The next group is ''flexible expenses'', which are expenses that you can control. When thinking about flexible expenses, think about what you need and what you want. This will help you to control your spending in this category. What are some ways that you could control the costs of these expenses?

Also, make sure to pay yourself first. Set aside money from each paycheck and put it towards your savings. You will notice in the example below that “savings” is listed as an expense.

Calculate your total expenses by adding the numbers in the right column. This number represents your total monthly expenses.

===Compare===
Now, compare your ''Total income'' (left column) to ''Total expenses'' (right column). If your income is more than your expenses, you are spending less than you earn and are on the right path to ''live below your means''.

Otherwise, you should revise your budget and reconsider whether or not you are ready to invest.

{{notice|1=&lt;font color="darkgreen"&gt;''To assist in the education of U.S. military personnel on financial topics, this article departs from the wiki's policy of neutrality. Please see forum discussion: [http://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=48901 Military Investing]''&lt;/font&gt;}}

U.S. military personnel have a number of financial and investing situations that are specific to military service. '''{{PAGENAME}}''' highlights some of these topics.

==General military issues==

* '''Military members move frequently.'''
These moves make home ownership problematic for military members. Before committing to home ownership, carefully consider the following:
:* Landlording can be a difficult second job, especially for an absentee landlord.
:* Contrary to popular belief, housing values do not always go up,&lt;ref group="note"&gt; The rise and fall of residential real estate prices are exemplified by the Case-Shiller Home Price Indices, see [http://www.housingviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/CSHomePrice_Release_Sept2011.pdf Home Prices Continue to Show Seasonal Strength According to the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller Home Price Indices], press release, September 27, 2011. &lt;/ref&gt; and transaction costs are huge when you buy and sell.&lt;ref&gt; See  [http://ezinearticles.com/?What-Are-The-Real-Costs-Of-Selling-A-Home?&amp;id=139629 What Are The Real Costs of Selling a Home]; and [http://www.bankrate.com/finance/mortgages/2011-closing-costs/closing-costs-by-state.aspx State by State Closing Costs], from Bankrate.com &lt;/ref&gt;
:* It is likely that you will not want to go back to your starter house, townhome, or condo when you get out of the service, and the burdens of being an absentee landlord will continue. 
Give very serious consideration to just renting your entire career, carefully saving up a down payment for your dream house when you get out. Obviously this does not apply to everyone, but it does apply to far more people than usually realize it.
* '''Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH)'''
The Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) is calculated based on your rank, where you are stationed, and whether you have any dependents registered in DEERS.&lt;ref&gt; The [http://www.military.com/benefits/content/tricare/defense-enrollment-eligibility-reporting-system-deers.html Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System] &lt;/ref&gt;  But there is no requirement that BAH has to be spent exclusively on housing costs. Feel free to spend less and save the difference. BAH is not taxed.&lt;ref name = "Tax" group="note"&gt;See if you can take advantage of the IRS's [http://www.irs.gov/newsroom/article/0,,id=107686,00.html Savers Credit]; check [http://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=1329327#p1329327 this forum post] for details. IRS [http://www.irs.gov/publications/p3/index.html Publication 3, Armed Forces' Tax Guide] will help with taxes.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''' Basic Allowance for Subsistence (BAS)'''
The Basic Allowance for Subsistence (BAS) is calculated based on whether you are an officer or enlisted.  Active duty service members who are not issued a meal card are entitled to BAS. There is no requirement that BAS has to be spent exclusively on food. BAS is not taxed.&lt;ref name = "Tax" group="note"/&gt;
*'''Cost of Living Allowance (COLA)'''
Cost of Living Allowance (COLA) is available to service members stationed overseas to compensate for the difference in value between the US dollar and the local currency. However, items purchased on-post overseas are still bought in US dollars. There is no requirement for you to spend this on the local economy, so feel free to save/invest this. COLA is not taxed.
* '''Military members have low tax burdens.'''
Most military members have an effective federal tax rate well below 5%, and many are negative. Allowances are tax-free. Basic pay is tax-free when you are deployed. Even re-enlistment bonuses can be tax-free if taken while deployed. In general, with these low tax rates, choose a Roth account (pay tax now instead of later) instead of a tax-deferred account (pay tax later instead of now.) The [[:Thrift Savings Plan | TSP]] (Thrift Savings Plan) offers a Roth option, and military will normally have low enough income to contribute to a [[Roth IRA]].  Additionally, your personal property (such as your car) is considered to be located in your home state for tax purposes. This can be beneficial to service members stationed in a state that taxes personal property (such as Virginia).
* '''If you are not a resident of a state with no income tax...'''
If you are not a resident of a state with no income tax, examine carefully the advantages of establishing residency in one of these states. (Seven states have no state income tax: Alaska, Florida, Nevada, South Dakota, Texas, Washington and Wyoming. Two others, New Hampshire and Tennessee, tax only dividend and interest income).&lt;ref&gt; See [http://www.taxadmin.org/fta/rate/tax_stru.html FTA State Tax Comparisons], click ''State Individual Tax Rates'' for pdf. file for the current year. &lt;/ref&gt; Michigan exempts military pay from its income tax. Note that if you are stationed in Alaska, the permanent fund dividend distributed to state residents is an additional benefit.&lt;ref&gt; See [http://www.pfd.alaska.gov/military/index.aspx Permanent Fund Dividend Division, Military Information] and [http://www.pfd.state.ak.us/faqs/index.aspx Permanent Fund Dividend Division, FAQs] &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Table 1 (page 10) in [http://legis.wisconsin.gov/lfb/publications/Miscellaneous/Documents/2012_07_25Individual%20Income%20Tax%20Provisions%20in%20the%20States.pdf Individual Income Tax Provisions in the States], from the [http://legis.wisconsin.gov/lfb/Pages/default.aspx Wisconsin Legislative Fiscal Bureau], contains a state-by-state list of active duty military pay provisions (Tax Year 2011). July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Military members have very secure, very regular income.'''
Take advantage of this to make your investments automatic. Set-up automatic withdrawals into your retirement accounts to take advantage of compounding returns. In addition, secure income usually requires a smaller emergency fund than the typical person requires. Three months worth of expenses held in an emergency fund should be adequate..
*''' Take advantage of educational opportunities available in and through the military'''
For example, one smart strategy for young military enlistees (age 17) is to go to college while on active duty, transition midway through their careers into an officer field (for example med tech to nurse ), “retire” and at age 37 begin a new career with health benefits for life and a lifetime pension. The new GI bill has many advantageous features. Learn the benefits and take advantage of them.&lt;ref&gt; See [http://www.gibill.va.gov/ United States Department of Veterans Affairs Post 9/11 GI Bill] and especially these forum posts: [http://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=1341842#p1341842 Military Investing].&lt;/ref&gt;
*''' Be cautious when dealing with car dealers.'''
You do not need to buy luxury vehicles. Unscrupulous car dealers around bases will try to induce you to buy expensive cars.&lt;ref&gt; See [http://www.carbuyingtips.com/military.htm Car Buying Tips For Our Friends in the Military], from CarBuyingTips.com &lt;/ref&gt;  An expensive car can lead you into a debt cycle that will take half a career to climb out of, if you can ever get out at all. Take advantage of free legal services and have your local legal office review the purchase agreement before you sign.
*'''Avoid the payday loan shops.'''
Avoid the payday loan shops that are common at the entrances to the base. Never take a loan from a payday or title loan company. Interest charges are excessively high. Prudent debt management requires you to keep debt under control. Note that a bad credit score will affect your security clearance and career.
* '''Take advantage of TRICARE health insurance, even after retirement.'''
There is no better deal in health insurance, and military members can cover all of their dependents cheaply.  Military retirees can and should retain coverage, and can select from several plans.&lt;ref&gt; See [http://www.tricare.mil/tricaresmart/default.aspx TRICARE Publications]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military specific investments==
* '''Financial literacy'''
Personal finance is much more than understanding your investments. It involves items such as managing day-to-day expenses, insurance, and taking care of your family in times of need. Planning a course through this maze is an essential first step. Where do you start? Retired Marine Mark Hensen has created a PowerPoint presentation that will walk you through the basics. Download his free presentation [[Bogleheads® financial literacy project#Member supplied material| here]] (Personal Financial Management Basics for U.S. Military).
* '''The TSP is the military “401K”.'''
It is one of the lowest cost 401Ks in the country. In investing, costs matter. Vanguard is the low-cost leader in the investment field due to their unique structure. Their investing fees of 0.037%-0.051% are 1/10th that of most of their competitors, and comparable to the lowest-cost options from retail providers such as Vanguard and Fidelity.  It is a great place to invest, with traditional and Roth options both available. You can currently put up to $23,600 of tax-deferred contributions in 2025, $24,500 in 2026, or $70,000 in 2025 and $72,000 in 2026 of total contributions (including tax-free combat pay) per year into the TSP.&lt;ref&gt; See [https://www.tsp.gov/planparticipation/eligibility/contributionLimits.shtml TSP Contribution Limits].&lt;/ref&gt; There are several different index funds in it. These include:
:* '''The C fund''': an S&amp;P 500 index fund.
:* '''The S fund''': an extended market index fund (all the US stocks that are not included in the S&amp;P 500 index).
:* '''The I fund''': a total international market fund excluding China and Hong Kong.
:* '''The F fund''': a total bond market index fund, holding basically all the bonds sold in the US. 
:* '''The [[G Fund | G fund]]''': a very special fixed income account. It pays you a bond rate of return, yet with zero risk of loss.&lt;ref group="note"&gt; The G Fund interest rate calculation is based on the weighted average yield of all outstanding Treasury notes and bonds with 4 or more years to maturity. As a result, participants who invest in the G Fund are rewarded with a long-term rate on what is essentially a short-term security.  [https://www.tsp.gov/investmentfunds/fundsheets/fundPerformance_G.shtml TSP G Fundsheet] &lt;/ref&gt;  Although its expected return is lower than other funds, it is much higher than other similar risk-free investments. As such, many [[The Bogleheads&amp;reg; |Bogleheads]] with TSP access use the G fund as their primary bond investment.
:* '''L funds''': [[Target Retirement Funds |target retirement funds]] which provide a reasonable mix of the other funds with no additional costs for the diversification. Be sure to check the prospectus and find the asset allocation mix you are comfortable with.  

You can exchange funds within the TSP with no transaction fees, commission costs, or taxes.&lt;ref group="note"&gt; TSP limits interfund transfers between funds to two per month. After two monthly transfers, only transfers into the G Fund are permitted. See [https://www.tsp.gov/PDF/formspubs/tsplf14.pdf Thrift Savings Plans Information Sheets]&lt;/ref&gt;
When you leave the service, it is prudent to not take all your money out of the TSP. Subsequent jobs will likely have 401K plans that will not be as good as the TSP and, as long as you keep some money in the TSP, you can always rollover subsequent 401(k) plan assets  back into it in later years. 

* '''A military pension is better than most pensions.'''
Consider remaining in the service for the required 20 years to get this pension. A military pension is special for two reasons. First, active duty retired pay starts when you retire, rather than when you turn 65. (Reserve retired pay generally starts at age 60.) A pension beginning in your 40s is a whole lot more valuable than one that begins in your 60s. Second, it includes health benefits. This is such a significant cost to most early retirees that many end up having to work until they qualify for Medicare primarily due to the cost of health care.
:Example: How much is the pension and health benefits worth? Suppose you retire as an E-7 after 20 years. That would pay you about $2100 per month, or about $25,000 a year, indexed to inflation. An inflation indexed annuity that pays out $25K a year would currently cost you about $450,000. Add in health care costs for 40-50 years and you can probably safely double that amount. An officer that retires at O-5 would have a pension equivalent to an annuity costing $800K, plus health care benefits. Your regular, secure income combined with this pension allows you to take a great deal of investment risk with your TSP and Roth IRAs.

The FY16 National Defense Authorization Act provides our military force with a modernized retirement plan built for retirement savings. Beginning in 2018, our service members can gain automatic and matching Thrift Savings Plan contributions as well as mid-career compensation incentives plus a monthly annuity for life. All service members under the current system are grandfathered into today’s retirement system. See: [http://www.uscg.mil/hq/cg1/cg131/docs/mbr_res/BlendedRetirementSystemInfographic.pdf The U.S. Armed Forces Blended Retirement System ''At a Glance''].&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Congress passed and the President signed into law the National Defense Authorization Act of 2016 that features the new modernized military retirement system. The new retirement system is effective Jan. 1, 2018, and is designed to maintain readiness and retain talent in an increasingly competitive labor market. The new retirement system is also intended to provide service members who serve less than 20 years with a portable retirement benefit. Ref: [http://www.uscg.mil/hq/cg1/cg131/mr-modret.asp Office of Reserve Affairs (CG-131)], US Coast Guard.&lt;/ref&gt; Full details can be found in this {{Forum post|p=2726531|title=New Military Retirement System, by Nords}}.
*'''Savings Deposit Program (SDP)''' 
The Savings Deposit Program (SDP) is a program that allows you to put in up to $10K while deployed. It pays 10% per year, guaranteed, and continues to pay for three months after you come home. Take advantage if you can. Given special deployment bonuses, lower expenses, and tax-free income, it should be easy to do. You can also defer tax-exempt money into the TSP, but you should only consider doing this if you are already maxing out the SDP AND Roth IRAs for the year. Even then, you may be better off putting that money toward a mortgage, a downpayment, or even a taxable investing account. Be sure to max out your tax-deferred TSP contribution (at least until the Roth TSP becomes available) before or after you deploy, assuming you are not gone the whole year.
*'''Look into USAA for your insurance needs.'''
[[wikipedia:USAA|USAA]] has an acknowledged reputation for providing good service and good pricing.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USAA USAA - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt; Their banking and investments are not bad either, although most Bogleheads prefer Vanguard for investments.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;USAA also offers a car-buying service that includes both new and used cars, and which can provide you some assurance in getting a reasonable deal.&lt;/ref&gt; Shop around, as you may find better auto insurance deals with [[wikipedia:GEICO|GEICO]] or [[wikipedia:Allstate|Allstate]].&lt;ref&gt;Reader feedback in this article's [[Talk:Military finances|discussion tab]].&lt;/ref&gt;
*''' If you need a good cash rewards credit card, consider opening an account at [[:Pentagon Federal Credit Union | PenFed]].'''
It only costs $5 (which you technically get back when the account is closed).
*'''Be sure to shop on base to enjoy tax-free savings.'''
Be sure to shop on base to enjoy tax-free savings at the commissary and the BX/PX/Navy exchange. That adds up over time. Remember the laws of economics do not actually apply at the BX so sometimes you find things ridiculously cheap and sometimes they cost way more than they would elsewhere, so be sure to shop around. Also be sure to ask for a military discount everywhere you go. You will be surprised how often you get one. The fewer the number of military people in the area the more likely you are to get a significant discount.
*'''Stay away from anything that says “First Command” on it'''.&lt;ref&gt; See [http://www.militarymoney.com/DebtHelp/deceptivepractices/tabid/75/itemId/1721/Default.aspx Trapped! Financial Scams Are Targeting Military Families] and [http://www.sec.gov/news/press/2004-170.htm First Command to Pay $12 Million to Settle SEC and NASD Charges Involving Misleading Sales of Investments to Members of the Military], from the SEC &lt;/ref&gt;
Stay away from anyone who encourages you to invest in something because it is better than the TSP. People who cater to military members are not usually looking out for you, even if they are former military.

A '''windfall''' is a significant amount of money that you receive unexpectedly. Windfalls range from small additions to wealth to large fortunes. Because they can mean huge changes in a recipient's life, psychological and emotional factors&lt;ref group="note"&gt;A wide range of responses can accompany a financial windfall. People who have received windfalls report experiencing a selection of the following emotions as they adjusted to their new circumstances.

The National Endowment for Financial Education advises windfall recipients to do the following:&lt;ref name="NEFE" /&gt;

Stay calm, and do not make any hasty decisions. Set aside one year's living expenses and place the rest of the windfall into low risk investments (FDIC insured accounts, money market funds, treasury bills) for one year. As it may take as long as five years for you to adjust to a new life, this pause provides space for emotions to cool, helps avoid impulsive behavior, and, if warranted, allows you time to put together a team of professional advisers. Then, create a detailed plan to meet your highest priority financial goals, and track your progress over the years. 

{{Notice|"Most financial practitioners agree that well over 50 percent [of windfalls] are lost in a relatively short period of time. NBC News reported that more than 70 percent of lottery winners exhaust their fortunes within three years." - {{cite book| title=The Bogleheads' Guide To Investing| title-link=Bogleheads' Guide To Investing| chapter=Chapter 15. How to Manage a Windfall Successfully| page=180| publisher=Wiley| isbn=978-0-471-73033-0}}}}

==Common sources of windfalls==
Windfalls come in many forms. Here are some common types:

* '''Legal settlements''': Settlements include personal injury settlements, settlements involving workers compensation and settlements of employment discrimination. Settlements may be a lump sum, or a structured settlement of annuity payments.
* '''Inheritances''': These often include retirement accounts and assets held in trust.
* '''Gifts''': These can range from annual gift exclusions up to the lifetime estate tax credit limit.
* '''Lottery winnings''': Taken as a series of payments; or as the sales value of payments exchanged for a lump sum.
* '''Insurance settlements''': These can be death benefits received as either a lump sum or annuity; as pre-death cash surrender values; or as life settlements, the sale of a life insurance policy by the owner to a third party in exchange for a lump sum.
* '''Retirement lump sums''': Usually taken in lieu of a lifetime series of annuity payments
* '''Sudden increases in income''': These can be bonus payments; stock options; or cashing shares in an IPO.

Other common sources of large lump sums include:&lt;ref name="Guide"&gt;{{cite book| title=The Bogleheads' Guide To Investing| title-link=Bogleheads' Guide To Investing| chapter=Chapter 15. How to Manage a Windfall Successfully| page=180| publisher=Wiley| isbn=978-0-471-73033-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A real estate sale
* The sale of a business
* Widowhood and divorce

Selling businesses or real estate converts an illiquid asset into large sums of cash. Death and divorce not only cause dislocation and trauma, but often suddenly thrust someone with little or no interest or no experience in investing, into having to manage family wealth.

==Size of a windfall==

Windfall sizes vary dramatically. A small windfall might bring you a step closer to your financial goals, a bigger one may make you financially independent, and an enormous windfall might be more money than you ever imagined spending. Windfall size is somewhat relative to your income and assets; what would be a life-changing amount of money for one person might only accelerate someone else's mortgage payoff by a few years. Some thresholds are more absolute, such as the Federal [[estate and inheritance tax|estate tax]] exemption ($15&amp;nbsp;million for singles and $30&amp;nbsp;million for married couples as of 2026&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-25-67.pdf|title=Notice 2025-67|publisher=IRS|accessdate=27 November 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;); financial planners generally agree that you need additional planning with assets above this level.

This wiki article aims to offer guidance for windfalls that are ''relatively'' large compared to your income and assets, enough to entail significant lifestyle changes and the need for additional planning. It applies to a wide variety of windfall types, sources, and absolute sizes. Use the guidance that is most relevant to your individual situation.

==Common pitfalls==

Common errors of commission made by windfall recipients include:&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web| url=https://www.stephenlnelson.com/WindfallFinancialPlanning.htm| title=Financial Planning for a Windfall in Wealth: Lotteries, Stock Options, Inheritances and Other Surprises| author=Stephen L. Nelson| accessdate=August 11, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* quitting your job prematurely
* buying extravagantly priced automobiles or properties, or other expensive consumption spending
* feeling overconfident about your business or investing acumen, jumping into new high risk investments (such as hedge funds) or as an "angel" investor in start-up companies
* falling prey to overcomplicated estate and investment management schemes. Watch out for people who might try to exploit you or take advantage of your new wealth. You can be a target for all kinds of financial schemes. 
* by being too generous to family, friends, and charities

Common errors of omission include failing to:

* pay the legally required taxes
* choose risk-appropriate investments and earn a reasonable return on invested capital
* use appropriate accounts such as retirement plans
* engage with the right professionals
* set up the appropriate plans, including estate plans

==Preparing==

These initial steps will help position you to manage a life-changing amount of money: 

===Take your time===

Avoid immediate impulse decisions. This is key to prudent windfall management. Among recommendations for this period are:
* Tell as few people as possible. Unfortunately, even those close to you may become resentful or solicit you for gifts when they hear about your windfall. You can always tell people later on when you have had time to consider the effect it may have on your relationships. 
* Set aside six months to one year's worth of expenses in an accessible account, such as your checking account. Place the remaining windfall assets in separate accounts holding secure low-risk savings vehicles, such as FDIC guaranteed bank accounts and [[Certificate of Deposit|CD]]s, [[Money Markets|money market funds]], and [[Treasury bill|treasury bills]].
* Use this time to begin resolving emotional, family, and social issues. Different sources of windfall, such as the death of a loved one, may have powerful emotional consequences that you should focus on addressing, while spending minimal time worrying about finances. Coming to terms with your emotions will allow you to make better financial decisions.&lt;ref group="note"&gt; The emotional and social issues surrounding windfalls are explored in greater detail in the following links:

* Hire a competent and unbiased tax professional, such as Certified Public Accountant (CPA), if you do not already have one. You may need to file estimated taxes. Complex tax issues may surround distributions from retirement plans, inheritances, and lottery winnings, as well as the exercise of stock options. If you are not sure if your windfall has tax consequences, many tax professionals will be willing to give you a free consultation. Prefer someone who does not sell investment products.
* If you have more complex finance issues that should not wait at least 6-12 months, skip ahead to the ''[[#Get_help|Get help]]'' step and pay a fair hourly rate for consultation from a fiduciary financial advisor, preferably one with a CFP or CFA certification. Urgent financial issues include having to decide whether to receive a lump sum or annuity stream; having a large amount of high-interest debt; or facing imminent eviction, foreclosure, or collection action due to delinquent debts. The focus of the consultation should just be resolving your urgent issues, not necessarily developing a complete financial plan or investing capital. The goal is not to begin putting your money to work, but rather to reduce stress and distractions by stabilizing your financial situation. Only make the minimum payments that will allow you to focus on the future, and do not redirect payments from paid-off debts to more spending.

====Lump sum vs. annuity====
{{Main|Lump sum vs pension}}

Choosing between a lump sum or a stream of payments can be complex. Factors include your financial goals, expected investment performance, taxes, inflation protection, life expectancy, estate planning goals, financial health of the annuity provider, and others. If you are at all unsure of the best course of action, a consultation with a fee-only fiduciary financial advisor would be extremely valuable. However, most windfall recipients should lean strongly toward choosing the annuity, for these reasons:

* You are less likely to squander the windfall. You can lose a lump sum with just one bad financial decision, whereas squandering an annuity requires a series of many bad choices, and not learning from prior mistakes.
* The most common reason to choose a lump sum is expecting a higher rate of return than the effective rate of return of the annuity. However, most windfall recipients are investment novices who are less likely to reliably generate high returns from their investments. This makes the protection of principal plus guaranteed return of the annuity more attractive in comparison.
* You have less ''need'' to earn a high return, so the guaranteed return of the annuity is more likely to be adequate to support a comfortable and prosperous lifestyle.

This reasoning is very similar to why windfall recipients should [[#Debts|pay off existing debts and avoid taking on new ones]]. These as well as any more general reasons that may apply, such as tax savings.

===Think about goals===

Begin to think about your long term goals, with more focus on the life you would like to create and (for now) less focus about how to achieve it. Some ideas for goals that may be meaningful:

* Retiring, either in the short or long term
* Cutting back hours at work, or dropping less desirable shifts or jobs
* Changing jobs
* Starting a business
* Going back to school, either to pursue a new career or just for enjoyment
* Saving money for benefit of a loved one ([[529 plan]] for education, trust fund, helping pay for a wedding or house down payment, etc.)
* Moving to another city, or country
* Paying off debts
* Certain consumer purchases
* Purchasing real estate
* Traveling
* Taking up a new hobby
* Growing your family
* Donating to charity
* Volunteering your time

Even a very large windfall will probably not be enough to fully fund all or even most of these goals, so it is important to prioritize your goals, both by overall priority, and by the time it will take you to reach them. Many financial novices are surprised how ''little'' of a windfall they are actually able to spend immediately. For example, a $1&amp;nbsp;million windfall will only generate about $30-40,000 per year of investment income over the long run, so you will need to limit your initial spending so that the windfall can provide a lasting improvement in lifestyle. You can then formalize your specific goals, and allocation of money toward them, later in a written financial plan.

===Get educated===

Like it or not, you now have a new job (in addition to any other jobs you may already have) - learning how to manage money. Whether or not you are inclined to "do-it-yourself", you will need at least the knowledge necessary to evaluate financial professionals. Learning about personal finance and investing will likely be, by far, the most money you will ever "earn" per hour, if it makes the difference between lifelong prosperity and a fortune squandered within a few years. 

* Read some [[Book recommendations and reviews|recommended books]] on personal finance and investing. Reading at least three, that cover the topics of personal finance and investing, would be a good start.
* Browse the rest of the [[Main Page|Bogleheads wiki]]. Many articles are written to be accessible to readers with little or no investing experience.

===Get help===

Unless you are already an experienced investor, it may be beneficial to hire a professional, at least for some initial guidance. If you decide to use an adviser, in chapter 16 of ''[[Bogleheads' Guide To Investing|The Bogleheads' Guide To Investing]]'' the authors recommend choosing an adviser who has earned a CFA (Chartered Financial Analyst) or a CFP (Certified Financial Planner) designation; uses a fee-only payment arrangement; and advocates an index fund investing approach. Fee-only compensation minimizes the advisor's conflicts of interest with your own financial success. A good financial advisor should be able to do the following:

* Calculate whether it is better to receive a lump sum or annuity stream of payments from a settlement, lottery winning, or retirement package
* Strategize about how to minimize taxes owed
* Recommend an investment strategy
* Recommend any additional types of insurance you may need, or what current types of insurance you hold may no longer be needed
* Determine whether you need to enlist an estate planning attorney&lt;ref group="note"&gt; The authors of ''[[Bogleheads' Guide To Investing|The Bogleheads' Guide To Investing]]'' recommend [https://www.martindale.com/ Martindale-Hubbell] for checking out the credentials of an attorney. &lt;/ref&gt; 
You can get free portfolio reviews and answers to personal finance questions on the [https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/index.php Bogleheads forums]. Most forum members are not finance professionals, but are nonetheless experienced investors, and as a whole have managed an enormous range of income and assets.

Whether you should retain a [https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Financial_planner financial planner] for a long time, or do your own investing using the [[Bogleheads® investment philosophy|Bogleheads investment philosophy]] or similar, is a personal choice. When you have time, consider the "[[Getting_started|getting started]]" wiki article (and the rest of this one). The more you learn, the better you will be able to judge whether an advisor is worth the cost to you.

==Creating a plan==

{{Quotation|Once you begin to become comfortable in your new financial reality, you may be ready for the successive phases, which include reviewing your situation and deciding how the money will be used. This is the fun part, when you'll choose -- with the help of... a solid financial plan -- whether to retire, buy a vacation home, donate to charities or set up trust funds for your children. The ultimate goal of all these steps is to create a sensible plan for handling your windfall that also allows you to come out with your relationships and sanity intact.|Susan Bradley|[https://web.archive.org/web/20161207071725/http://www.bankrate.com/finance/personal-finance/4-steps-to-profit-from-a-windfall-1.aspx 4 steps to profit from a financial windfall]}}

[[Financial planning|Financial planning]] is a ''long-term'' process&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Sound financial planning incorporates these steps: 
#Establish a relationship with a CFP professional
#Gather your data and develop your financial goals
#Analyze and evaluate your financial status
#Review your CFP professional’s recommendations
#Set your course
#Benchmark your progress against the financial goals you established
Source: [https://www.letsmakeaplan.org/other-resources/financial-planning-process Financial Planning Process], by the [https://www.letsmakeaplan.org Certified Financial Planner Board of Standards, Inc.]&lt;/ref&gt; of managing your finances so you can achieve your goals and dreams, while at the same time negotiating the financial barriers that inevitably arise in every stage of life. Fundamentally, the process for financial planning after receiving a windfall is the same as in any other situation. The only differences are:

* Larger amounts of money increase the relative importance of certain aspects of financial planning, such as tax planning and [[Tax-efficient fund placement|tax-efficient investing]], [[Index fund|minimizing investment costs]], [[Asset protection|asset protection]], and [[Estate planning|estate planning]].
* Windfall recipients are often thrust into a situation where they need to manage a large amount of money without having the necessary skills, knowledge, and experience. 
* Serious emotional impacts often surround windfalls, which you must deal with at the same time as financial planning.
* The consequences of financial mistakes are higher, in terms of absolute dollars, with larger amounts of money.

The core of financial planning is matching your goals, and the financial resources they will likely require, with your available resources. These can be your present resources, but also future investment proceeds and any future earnings. Matching requires knowing the costs of your goals (both up-front and ongoing), how much of your available funds will need to go to taxes, and expected returns on various types of investments. Prioritize your goals, and then weight these priorities by the financial resources needed to meet them. The result is a detailed financial plan that lists your goals, describes ''when'' and ''how'' you expect to meet them, and that is robust to factors beyond your control, such as job loss, unexpected expenses, and market swings. A complete financial plan should address all of the following areas:

===Work, income, and education===

If you are currently working, plan how long you will continue to work. If retirement is a high priority, and your windfall allows you to live off investment income with a [[Safe withdrawal rates|safe withdrawal rate]] (typically 3-4%), then you may be able to retire immediately. If you continue to work, include your expected future income in your financial plan.

The windfall may allow you to change jobs, start your own business, or get additional training that would enable a new career, so consider whether these options are desirable.

===Location===

Decide where you would like to live, and include in your plan costs with moving and living there. Typically the largest financial factors connected to location are available jobs, cost of living (particularly housing), state and local taxes, and proximity to family (which can affect travel and childcare costs). 

Your plan should include a location while working (if appropriate), and while retired. Differences in income tax rates can affect [[Traditional versus Roth|traditional versus Roth]] decisions.

===Spending===

Create a [[Household budgeting|written budget]] that includes allocations for meaningful categories of expense (food, transportation, and so on), and has some cushion for unexpected changes. Everyone needs a budget, no matter how much money they have. 

Include any immediate or planned future purchases, such as replacing an aging car immediately, or when it will reach the end of its life, and include saving for future purchases in the plan.

Consider both the up-front and ongoing costs of purchases. For example, windfall recipients often ignore the ongoing costs associated with expensive properties (property tax, maintenance, utilities, cleaning) or vehicles (fuel, insurance, maintenance, storage for the winter, and so on), which can be substantial.

Resist the temptation to spend a significant portion of a windfall on short-term consumption spending. The enjoyment you will get from investing and spending the windfall over a long period of time, and the comfort from having financial security, will likely far outweigh that from any consumer purchases.

===Accounts===

Understand the different types of tax-advantaged accounts available to you ([[401(k)]], [[IRA]], [[HSA]], [[529 plan]], [[Defined benefit pension plan]], and so on) and plan on using those that give you the greatest advantage. 

[[Variable Annuity|Variable annuities (VAs)]] are usually high-fee products marketed by commissioned salespeople, which are inferior to tax-advantaged accounts and [[Taxable account|taxable accounts]] and are best avoided. However, ''low-cost'' VAs can make sense for some windfall recipients. If you receive a large lump sum windfall that cannot be [[IRA rollovers and transfers|rolled over]] into an [[IRA]], and you intend to invest in [[Tax-efficient fund placement|tax-inefficient investments]], a low-cost VA will allow you to defer taxes on interest, dividends, and capital gains. The tax deferral ''may'' offset the VA fees, which are around 0.25%/year for a good low-cost VA, such as from [https://www.fidelity.com/annuities/FPRA-variable-annuity/overview Fidelity]. If you think a low-cost VA may be appropriate, consult with a third party fee-only financial advisor, who can help make sure the VA you are considering is well-suited for you and not fee-laden. See also: [[Non-deductible_traditional_IRA#Comparison_between_non-deductible_tIRA_and_taxable_accounts|performance comparison between non-deductible IRAs and taxable accounts]] (non-deductible IRAs have the same tax structure as VAs). 

Make sure any withdrawal restrictions (for example, penalties for non-qualified withdrawals from a 401(k) or IRA before age 59½) fit into your overall financial plan.

===Investments===
{{Notice|For further help on creating an investment portfolio, see:

*[[Lazy portfolios]]: Contains a number of widely diversified example portfolios.}}

Investing capital, and earning a good rate of return for an appropriate level of risk, is an essential part of almost all financial plans. Which investments are appropriate depends strongly on the time horizon of the goal you are saving for. For example:
* Short-term goals, within the next 3 years. Save using low-risk and low-volatility investments, such as savings accounts, [[Money markets|money market]] accounts or funds, [[Certificate of deposit|certificates of deposit (CDs)]], or short-term bonds. 
* Medium-term goals, in the 3-10 year range. Save with slightly more volatile investments, such as intermediate-term [[Bond basics|bonds]], and could include a small percentage of [[Stock basics|stocks]].
* Long-term goals, 10 or more years away. These can contain a large percentage of higher-volatility higher-return investments like [[Stock basics|stocks]] and real estate. 

Other key factors for choosing investments are need and willingness to take risk, and the consequences of falling short. See [[Asset allocation|asset allocation]] for a more detailed discussion.

You should generally purchase stock and bond investments through [[Index fund|low-cost passive mutual funds]] for [[Diversification|diversification]], [[Expense ratios|reduced costs]], and higher [[Tax-efficient fund placement|tax efficiency in a taxable account]]. Avoid purchasing individual stocks, due to the high volatility and risk of permanent loss.

You should be especially cautious with high-risk investments (for example, private equity, and startup companies) that have a significant possibility of a total loss. Most windfall recipients do not have the necessary experience to properly evaluate high-risk investments, and also do not have the need for higher than market returns. Windfall recipients are also often the targets of bad investments or scams; to reduce this risk, limit investments to diversified funds from respectable institutions.

Once you have made your investment decisions you should formalize them in an [[Investment policy statement]] (IPS) or [[Investment Policy Statement#Investing plan | investment plan]].

===Debts===
{{Main|Prioritizing investments}}

All financial plans should include a list of all current debts and a plan to pay them off. Quickly pay off medium- and high-interest debts, such as credit card debts. See also: [[Paying down loans versus investing]].

You should probably prioritize eliminating all debts, even low-interest ones, because the balance versus investing favors paying down debts more strongly than for more normal investors, for these reasons:
* Money put toward debt cannot later be inappropriately spent, or lost to bad investments or [[Asset protection|civil judgments]]. Historically, these have been common ways windfall recipients have squandered their fortunes.
* Once a debt is paid off, cash flow improves as a required monthly payment is eliminated. This is especially valuable when the windfall is a lump sum.
* The most common reason to invest instead of paying down a debt is the possibility for a higher return than the debt's interest cost. However, most windfall recipients are investment novices who are less likely to reliably generate high returns from their investments. This makes the protection of principal plus guaranteed "return" of paying down a debt more attractive in comparison.
* Windfall recipients have less ''need'' to earn a high return, so the guaranteed "return" of paying off debts is more likely to be adequate.

Similarly, you should avoid taking on new debts (for example, a large mortgage on an expensive new home), because servicing that debt will require good financial behavior over a much longer period of time, with many more opportunities for mistakes.

===Taxes===
{{Main|Tax basics}}

Because the US income tax code is [[Progressive tax|progressive]], taxes become a more important element of financial planning with larger income and assets. You will generally be able to reduce lifetime taxes with some basic tax planning. Common legal methods of reducing taxes include:
* Optimally timing the exercise of incentive stock options, sale of stock, etc. 
* If applicable, appropriate choice of a lump-sum or periodic payment
* Maximizing use of tax-advantaged accounts
* Appropriate choice of [[Traditional versus Roth|traditional versus Roth]] tax structures
* Investing in [[Municipal bonds|municipal bonds]] and/or [[Tax-managed fund comparison|tax-managed funds]] if the expected after-tax return is higher than standard investments
* Taking advantage of [[Step-up in basis|step-up in basis]] and [[Donating appreciated securities|donating appreciated shares to charity]]
* [[Tax loss harvesting]] and, if appropriate [[Tax gain harvesting|tax gain harvesting]]
* [[Tax-efficient fund placement]]
* Appropriately-timed [[Roth IRA conversion|Roth conversions]]
* Relocating to a low-tax or tax-free state, especially when withdrawing from tax-deferred accounts.

Avoid tax evasion schemes, including IRS listed transactions and offshore tax shelters, because these have a high risk of legal problems and IRS levies. Many scams are marketed as tax shelters too. You should not need to take on these high risks in order to meet your financial goals. 

===Insurance===
{{Main|Insurance}}

As your assets increase, most financial experts recommend that you increase your liability insurance limits. Large assets, especially if others know or can find out, make you a more attractive target for lawsuits, so more protection is warranted. High limits on the liability portions of renters', homeowner's, and auto policies are the best place to start. For more coverage, [[Umbrella insurance|umbrella insurance]] provides millions of dollars of additional liability coverage, which stacks on top of other policies. 

More assets mean that insurance deductibles can be raised. There is no need to pay higher premiums on a $250 or $500 deductible when a large reserve of assets can cover a $1,000 or $2,500 payment. 

Reconsider the need for life insurance and disability insurance. If your heirs would be able to sustain an acceptable standard of living on the assets you have, you do not need life insurance. Likewise, if you could maintain a decent standard of living for yourself and your family on your assets with no income, you do not need disability insurance. Canceling these policies will save premium costs.

[[Long-term care insurance]] is not necessary if the windfall allows you to self-insure against the risk.

Permanent life insurance (including whole life, cash value life, indexed universal life, and others) is a hybrid insurance/investing financial product often marketed to high net worth individuals. In reality, the products have high fees and low liquidity, and are not ideal for either life insurance or investing; they are only appropriate for very rare situations. It is probably best to simply avoid permanent life insurance, but if you think it would be appropriate, get a second opinion from a third party fee-only financial advisor (preferably a fiduciary CFP or CFA advisor), and shop around from several insurance companies to make sure you get the best deal.

If you have put off buying any essential insurance (health and liability, and [[Homeowner's insurance|homeowner's]], [[Professional insurance|professional/malpractice]], life or disability if appropriate), take this opportunity to fix this part of your financial picture.

===Emergency funds===
{{Main|Emergency fund}}

Once you get out of debt, you should create an emergency fund that covers about 6 months of living expenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Miriam Caldwell| date=February 1, 2019| 
 url=https://www.thebalance.com/what-should-i-do-with-a-sudden-windfall-2385942|title=What to Do With a Sudden Windfall?| publisher=the balance| access-date=May 30, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Deposit insurance|Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)]] insures bank accounts up to $250,000. If you are going to keep more than this amount in a bank account, consider dividing it among several accounts to keep your balance under this limit.

===Asset protection===
{{Main|Asset protection}}

Asset protection seeks to protect assets from potential creditor claims. For the majority of high net worth individuals, simple and inexpensive asset protection techniques and good financial behaviors in general will provide more than adequate protection:
* Keep comprehensive liability insurance with high limits
* Maximize use of tax-advantaged accounts
* Pay off debts, and especially your mortgage if home equity is protected from creditors in your state
* Avoid activities likely to create liability (risky driving habits, keeping dangerous dog breeds, letting your teenager's friends borrow your boat, and so on)
* Minimize spending on flashy, expensive items that advertise your wealth
* [[Asset titling in the United States|Title joint assets]] as Tenants of the Entirety (in states where allowed)
* Keep potentially liability-generating assets, such as rental properties, inside a Limited Liability Corporation (LLC)
* Divorce is the most common cause of loss of assets, so choose a spouse that shares your values, and invest the time and energy into the relationship necessary to keep it healthy. Consider whether a pre-nuptial or post-nuptial agreement is appropriate for your situation; they often are when there is a significant disparity in assets, or when a spouse has children from a prior relationship.

More complex and expensive asset protection techniques, such as offshore trusts, cost tens of thousands of dollars to set up, and thousands of dollars per year to maintain. They are also far from iron-clad, and even their proponents concede that they are intended to only dissuade potential lawsuits rather than provide reliable protection. The cost/benefit trade-off is not favorable for most people.

===Giving===

Charitable giving can be a meaningful part of a financial plan. Especially if your windfall is large enough to at least cover your basic needs for the rest of your life, strongly consider at least some charitable giving for these reasons:
* It can enrich your life and be incredibly rewarding to help those less fortunate than you
* Giving can change your perspective on your new wealth for the better, and even help teach good financial management behaviors that will make your windfall last much longer. For example, rather than viewing money as something to be hoarded or spent on fleeting pleasures, you can grow to view it as a powerful force that can be applied to create good in your and your family's life, and in your community. Adopting a ''stewardship'' perspective on your windfall will create a positive experience when you give to promote your values, and will also encourage you to preserve and manage your windfall to last a lifetime. 
* Charitable gifts are tax-deductible, so charitable giving can be significantly (although not completely) offset by tax savings.

Consider giving money to family or friends (to whom you would leave assets in your will) during your lifetime, rather than after you die. With life expectancies what they are today, your children could easily be in their 60s or 70s by the time you pass away, many decades past when they would be able to put a gift to the best use. Giving during your lifetime also lets you enjoy seeing the positive effects of those gifts.

While giving to family, friends, and charities can be immensely rewarding, take care of yourself first. While your windfall may seem like more money than you will ever need, progressive tax rates and the need for a low [[Safe withdrawal rates|safe withdrawal rate]] may mean you have far less money available on an ongoing basis than you first imagined. It is okay to give, but prioritize this against other goals and include it in a comprehensive plan.

Carefully consider the effect any gifts or loans to family or friends could have on your relationships. Experience indicates that loans to family and friends often strain relationships, creating stress and resentment on both sides, especially if the loan is not paid back exactly in accordance to the agreement. Giving, rather than lending, is usually a better way to help that minimizes the impact to the relationship, and will also limit your outlay to what you can afford to lose. 

Giving can also damage relationships, especially when the recipient is merely a friend or acquaintance as opposed to close family. After receiving a large gift, the recipient may feel pressure to behave a certain way (for example, spending time with you when it is inconvenient for them), and you may also wonder whether their friendship is predicated on the expectation of gifts, whether it actually is or not.

Be extremely cautious giving or lending money to anyone with severe financial trouble, including close family and friends. Most likely, behavioral finance problems were the dominant cause of the trouble. Unless and until those problems are fixed, they will quickly be back in similar trouble, and any money you gave would likely be wasted on high-interest debts and unnecessary spending. Look for other ways to help, such as hiring them a [[#Get_help|good fee-only financial planner]] or even providing some financial advice yourself using your newly acquired knowledge, if you feel comfortable. Not everyone would be receptive to this type of help, and some people's behavioral finance problems are irreparable, so be prepared to disengage with them on financial topics and provide support in other ways.

===Estate planning===
{{Main|Estate planning}}

Estate planning deals with preparing for your own death and the associated distribution of assets, and also planning for your own incapacity. Although certain elements of estate planning are appropriate for almost every adult, as a general rule estate planning becomes more important with higher levels of assets. For example:

* When you die and leave a large amount of assets to your heirs, you should think carefully about whether they will be able to manage that money without help, and whether they will spend it in a way you would approve of. [[Trusts]] are common in estate planning with higher levels of assets, and allow you to exercise some control over the money you leave to others after you are gone (among many other uses). Trusts can ensure money is professionally managed, only spent for expenses that align with your values, is dolled out in smaller amounts over time, gets more [[Asset protection|protection]] from heirs' potential creditors, and is kept out of heirs' eventual estate for estate taxes. Trusts are almost always appropriate when leaving money to minors or [[Trusts#Spendthrift_trusts|spendthrift]] heirs. Trusts can be written with almost any terms, and should be tailored to your individual situation. 
* If your assets are above the federal [[Estate and inheritance tax|estate tax]] exemption (as of 2025, $13.99&amp;nbsp;million for an individual and $27.98&amp;nbsp;million for a married couple, scheduled to increase to $15/30&amp;nbsp;million in 2026), additional planning is necessary. The federal estate tax is 40% of all assets above the exemption, so can be many millions of dollars for a large estate. Some states also have [[Estate_and_inheritance_tax#State_estate_and_inheritance_taxes|state estate tax]], and the exemption can be as low as $1&amp;nbsp;million. Estate tax planning has two goals: minimize the amount of taxes owed, and streamline the process for paying those taxes. See: [[Estate_planning#Estate_tax_planning_and_avoidance|Estate tax planning and avoidance]] for details.
* Avoiding [[probate]] generally becomes more valuable with higher levels of assets, as probate can have expenses that scale with the size of the estate. It also creates a public record of your assets, which is generally less desirable with higher levels of wealth. The costs and difficulty of probate are state-specific and vary greatly between states. A good estate planning attorney in your state can help you determine wither the benefits for avoiding probate (for example, with a [[Trusts#Revocable_Living_Trusts_(RLTs)|Revocable Living Trust]]) outweigh the downsides for your situation.
* Higher levels of assets increase the importance of having [[Estate_planning#Power_of_Attorney|Powers of Attorney]] in place, as the consequences for having your finances un-managed if you are incapacitated increase. 
* Charitable [[#Giving|giving]] often becomes more important with higher levels of assets. Charitable bequests are not subject to estate taxes.

Estate laws are state-specific, so consult an attorney in your state who specializes in estate planning. A good estate planning attorney will work with you to determine your needs in all these different areas, and create the documents and trusts you need to execute your estate plan.

==Monitor progress and make necessary adjustments==

At least once per year, check your your progress toward your goals, and consider the following checks and adjustments:
* Check your actual spending against your planned budget. The tendency to gradually increase your spending is known as ''lifestyle creep''. If you find your actual spending significantly exceeds your plan, evaluate the reasons why, and either reduce spending on the items that provide the least value, or adjust your financial plan to include higher spending. Raising your spending could delay or prevent you from reaching certain financial goals.
* Monitor the performance of your investments and [[Rebalancing|rebalance]] as necessary. Avoid any temptation to panic-sell either at market highs or lows. [[Bogleheads®_investment_philosophy#Stay_the_course|Stay the course]].
* Stay up-to-date on changes in tax laws, and change tax strategy if necessary.
* Reevaluate your insurance needs, and shop around with other insurance companies to make sure you are getting the lowest rates on policies, especially if your situation has changed significantly. 
* Reevaluate your estate plan. Beneficiaries may need to be changed, new trusts may need to be created, or old trusts may no longer be necessary. Estate tax laws also change frequently, so changes may be needed to avoid taxes.

Avoid the temptation to tinker with your plan and investments unnecessarily. Hot new investments often get covered by the press and on social media, usually after their price has been run up on speculation. Buying into the top of a bubble usually means you will lose a lot of money when the bubble bursts. If you think your investment plan needs a change, it is probably worth a consultation with a fee-only financial advisor.

As described in the page on [[Emergency_fund#Roth_IRA_as_an_emergency_fund|emergency funds]], in certain ''appropriate cases'', a [[Roth IRA]] can serve as a temporary emergency fund. The case study below outlines with specific details how this can be accomplished. Please see the linked page for more information on suitability of this tactic, including linked forum threads with additional details and other considerations.

== Overview ==
In this case study, we start with a working person's portfolio who has a $16,000 emergency fund in a taxable account, and who is contributing to her [[401(k)]] but not enough to maximize her contributions to $24,500 (which is the limit in 2025 for people under 50 years old) or to contribute to her Roth IRA.

In her situation, since she is ''not'' maximizing her tax-advantaged savings, she could shift up to $7,500 (which is the limit for Roth IRA contributions in 2025 for people under 50,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/401k-limit-increases-to-24500-for-2026-ira-limit-increases-to-7500| title=401(k) limit increases to $24,500 for 2026, IRA limit increases to $7,500| publisher=IRS| accessdate=27 November 2025}}
&lt;/ref&gt; assuming she is eligible) from her emergency fund in her taxable account, into her Roth IRA.

''If she '''is''' maximizing her tax-advantaged savings, then this case study is '''not''' applicable. In that case, emergency funds should be held in a taxable account.''

The reason for doing this is that at some point in the future, she might be able to maximize her tax-advantaged savings and still have enough left over to replenish her emergency fund in her taxable account. For each dollar she can replenish her emergency fund in the taxable account, she can "transfer" a dollar within her IRA account from being set aside for emergencies, to being set aside for retirement. Eventually, she can fully replenish her emergency fund in a taxable account and then "transfer" all the Roth IRA assets that had previously been set aside for emergency fund purposes into assets allocated for retirement. This essentially allows a person to make more contributions to tax-advantaged accounts than you ordinarily could in a given tax year.

If, before that milestone can happen, an emergency occurs and those funds are needed, she can withdraw them from her Roth IRA account and pay for the emergency. In this case, she has lost nothing because that money would have been in a taxable account anyway.

But if no emergency occurs, or if the emergencies are less than the amount that was transferred into the Roth IRA, then after replenishing the emergency fund in a taxable account, the portfolio can have a boost in retirement assets in the Roth IRA that otherwise would have had to be invested in a taxable account.

Note that throughout the entire case study, she always has $16,000 in her emergency fund -- that never changes. What does change is that the ''location'' of those funds moves from the taxable account, to the Roth IRA (except for $1,000), and then back to the taxable account.

== Considerations ==
Before undertaking this tactic, be aware of the following:
* Since emergency funds should be stable and not volatile, you should put your emergency fund in a Roth IRA in a fund that will hold its value reliably.
* Roth IRA rules allow withdrawals on ''contributions'' but there can be penalties on withdrawing ''earnings''.&lt;ref group ="note"&gt;Earnings of contributions withdrawn before the due date of that year will be taxed. See IRS Publication 590-B: [http://www.irs.gov/publications/p590b/ch02.html#en_US_2014_publink1000231057 Are Distributions Taxable?]&lt;/ref&gt; This is one disadvantage of this tactic, because if the emergency funds were in a taxable account, then you could count on your emergency fund to grow slightly from earnings. With all or part of your emergency fund in a Roth IRA, however, you won't be able to access those gains without paying a penalty.
* In developing a retirement portfolio's overall [[Asset allocation]], having all or part of a Roth IRA allocated toward an emergency fund can complicate the math. You should make sure to exclude the emergency fund portion in a Roth IRA from your overall asset allocation as it pertains to your retirement assets.
* For behavioral and psychological reasons, you should avoid "raiding" retirement accounts, which is why an emergency fund is typically held in a taxable account and not in tax-advantaged accounts intended for retirement savings. Therefore, an investor undertaking this tactic must have the discipline and account management skills to keep the emergency fund portion of her Roth IRA separate from the retirement portion. This principle can be made easier to follow by putting these amounts in different mutual funds.
* Funds in investment accounts (Roth IRA) are not immediately available. Check with the fund provider, as several days may be needed for the fund transfer process to complete.

== Case study ==
The following shows a detailed illustration over a 5-year period. After Year 5, a summary is shown of the potential benefits of undertaking this tactic of using a Roth IRA to hold emergency funds, versus leaving the emergency fund in the taxable account.

=== Assumptions ===
* For simplicity, this case study does not consider inflation or investment returns or taxes from one year to the next.
* For simplicity, it is assumed that the $16,000 that is deemed necessary for an emergency fund remains constant over the course of this case study, even though in real life that amount might need to rise over the years.
* For simplicity, only two mutual funds are considered: money market for emergency fund, and stocks for retirement.
* The investor is an employed person under the age of 50 years old.
* The maximum amount the person may contribute is $24,500 to a 401(k) and $7,500 to a Roth IRA (as this was updated in 2026 when those were the limits).

=== Year 0 ===
Starting out you have the following:

|-
|}

=== Year 1 ===
At the end of Year 1, you can contribute $17,000 to the 401(k).

Since you have not exhausted all your tax-advantaged space, you can move part of your emergency fund in the taxable account to the Roth IRA by making a $7,500 deposit into it, leaving behind $8,500 in the taxable account. You still have $16,000 in your emergency fund, only now it's split between two different accounts.

This leaves you with:

=== Year 2 ===
For Year 2, now you can contribute $24,500 to the 401(k) but that is the most you can do. You can shift another $7,500 from your taxable account into the Roth IRA, allocated toward the emergency fund. You still have $1,000 left over in the taxable account. Your overall emergency fund is still at $16,000, only you have $1,000 in taxable and $15,000 in the Roth IRA.

=== Year 3 ===
In Year 3, you now can contribute a total of $32,000 to max out your tax-advantaged space, with $24,500 to 401(k) and $7,000 to Roth IRA. There is no longer any more room in the Roth IRA to shift emergency fund money.

At the end of the year, the accounts look like this:

=== Year 4 ===
In Year 4, you now can contribute a total of $32,000 to max out your tax-advantaged space, and you still have another $5,000 to save. With that additional $5,000, you can start to rebuild your emergency fund in the taxable account. So, add $5,000 to your taxable account and allocate it toward the emergency fund. At the same time, you can re-allocate an equal portion in your Roth IRA ($5,000) from being allocated to emergency fund to being allocated to retirement by transferring $5,000 from the money market fund to the stock fund that is allocated for retirement.

At the end of the year, the accounts look like this:

=== Year 5 ===
In Year 5, you can contribute a total of $32,000 to max out your tax-advantaged space, and you have an additional $10,000 to save. Similar to what you did in Year 4, add the $10,000 to your taxable account and allocate it toward your emergency fund. With the addition of $10,000 to your emergency fund in the taxable account, you can exchange the $10,000 in the Roth IRA account that is allocated to the emergency fund, to retirement. You've now built your emergency fund back up in the taxable account.

At the end of this year, your Roth IRA is now allocated 100% to your retirement allocation, and 100% of your emergency fund is back in the taxable account.

At the end of the year, the accounts look like this:

If you had left your emergency fund in the taxable account all along, then you wouldn't have been able to get the extra $14,000 of savings in Year 4 and Year 5 into the Roth IRA. Instead, in Year 4 when you have an additional $5,000 to invest, you would only be able to add it to a stock/retirement fund in taxable account, and in Year 5, when you have an additional $10,000 to invest, you would only be able to invest it into the same taxable account.

What both scenarios have in common is that at the end of Year 5, you have $16,000 in the emergency fund in the taxable account, and both scenarios have an identical amount in the 401(k).

But in the Roth as Emergency Fund scenario you have $15,000 more in the Roth IRA. Here is a summary of all '''retirement''' assets in the taxable account and the Roth IRA account at the end of Year 5 when you use the Roth IRA as an emergency fund:
{| class="wikitable" border="1"
|-
! width="150"|Account
! width="150"|Balance
|-
| Taxable
|align="center"| $0.00
|-
| Roth IRA
|align="center"| $40,500
|-
| '''TOTAL'''
|align="center"| '''$40,500'''
|-
|}
By contrast, here is what your accounts look like if you never availed yourself of the Roth IRA as an emergency fund:
{| class="wikitable" border="1"
|-
! width="150"|Account
! width="150"|Balance
|-
| Taxable
|align="center"| $15,000
|-
| Roth IRA
|align="center"| $25,500
|-
| '''TOTAL'''
|align="center"| '''$40,500'''
|-
|}

Clearly, the first option is superior because you have all $40,500 in the Roth IRA.

=== Variations ===
Variations with this case study:
* If the person had to make a withdrawal from the Roth IRA for an emergency, then that would simply deduct that portion from the Roth IRA. Withdrawals for emergencies should start in the taxable account (if there are any emergency funds in the taxable account) first and then move to the Roth IRA. That would, consequently, leave less money to "transfer" from emergency fund to retirement if/when the investor can replenish her emergency fund in a taxable account.
* If this person's income and ability to save had not risen as fast, then the remaining $1,000 in the taxable account could have been transferred in Year 4 into the Roth IRA.
* This case study began with someone who already has an emergency fund. This case study could also be adapted for someone who is just building an emergency fund. In that case, contributions to the emergency fund could go into the Roth (up to the maximum amount allowed per year).

An '''emergency fund''' is a cash reserve to cover unanticipated needs for cash, such as medical bills, car or home repair, or job loss. It is usually specified as a multiple of monthly expenses, for example, three months to one year's worth of expenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author1=Larry E. Swedroe| author1-link=Larry Swedroe| author2=Kevin Grogan| author3=Tiya Lim| title=The Only Guide You'll Ever Need for the Right Financial Plan: Managing Your Wealth, Risk, and Investments| publisher=Bloomberg Press| edition=1| date=August 2, 2010| page=18| isbn=978-1-57660-366-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

An emergency fund aims to give you a cushion of [http://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidity.asp liquidity] to cover unexpected expenses or becoming unemployed and losing your regular income. Keep your emergency funds in a highly liquid, low risk vehicle; for example, a [[money market]] fund or a bank savings account.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;See: {{cite journal| author1=Johnson, D. P.| author2=Widdows, R.| date=1985| title=Emergency fund levels of households| editor=K. P. Schnittgrund| journal=Proceedings of the 31st Annual Conference of the American Council of Consumer Interests| pages=235-241}} &lt;br&gt; In this paper, the authors define emergency funds as "financial holdings which are available to cover spending in the event of an emergency (income disruption) without drastically adjusting the household’s current level of living." &lt;/ref&gt;

Ideally you build your emergency fund at the same time as taking any employer match to an [[Employer retirement plans overview|employer retirement plan]] (for example, [[401(k)]] or [[403(b)|403b]]) and paying down high-interest-rate debt (such as [[Credit cards|credit card]] debt). Investing for longer range goals, such as retirement, college expenses or a home down payment, comes later. 

== Placement of emergency funds ==
Keep your emergency funds in a highly liquid, easy to access, low risk vehicle with guarantee on the capital. Examples include:
* Checking account
* Money market fund
* (High yield) (insured) savings account
* Reward checking account (RCA), which offers somewhat higher return, if you are willing to put in the effort to set one up.

It might be useful to keep some real cash available for any emergencies where you do not have access to bank accounts.

== Multi-tiered emergency fund ==

By far the most common emergency that would require you to use your emergency fund is the loss of a job. Because you will not need all the funds at once in this case, you might have multiple tiers of emergency fund so that you can place funds not needed for several months in short-term bonds (including [[CD]]s) to earn higher yield.

Those investment products include very short-term [[Treasury bill|treasury bills]], as well as [[CD]]s, which often have an option allowing you to cash them in at any time for a small penalty. You can cash in [[I savings bonds | I bonds]] at no cost after a period, so these can also form a part of a second tier of emergency fund.

For instance, a multi-tiered emergency fund could consist of:
* Three months of expenses in cash (bank account or money market fund)
* The next three months of expenses in CDs with the option to cash them in for three months of interest
* The next three months of expenses in a short-term Treasury bond fund. Selling these would [[Bonds: advanced topics#Duration| risk incurring some loss of principal]] due to interest rate changes, but because the odds of needing to rely on your emergency fund for more than six months are slim, you might consider this an acceptable compromise.&lt;ref group="note"&gt; Johnson &amp; Widdows define three levels of potential emergency fund assets:
#''Quick'' — assets held in savings, checking and money market accounts.
#''Intermediate'' — quick assets plus CDs and savings certificates.
#''Comprehensive'' — intermediate assets plus the value of stocks and bonds.&lt;/ref&gt;

==A note on unemployment benefits==

The most common emergency is job loss. In the United States, many workers who are laid off are eligible for unemployment insurance payments. Eligibility and the size of the benefit vary by state. An important part of your planning should be to find out the rules in your state, and try to determine if you would be eligible, and what the size of the benefit would be.

As a rough guide, unemployment benefit could be about 50% of salary, up to a maximum of about $500 per week, for a maximum of six months. This implies that for many people, unemployment insurance could serve as part as an "emergency fund," with a value of over $10,000.

== Cash emergency fund vs line of credit ==

Some people view various forms of credit, particularly a [[Wikipedia:Home equity line of credit|Home equity line of credit]] (HELOC), as suitable for emergency funds; others strongly disagree. You can often withdraw credit lines with little or no notice, and some emergencies which require you to draw on the emergency fund may also cause a creditor to question your ability to repay.

==Roth IRA as an emergency fund==
{{Main|Roth IRA as an emergency fund}}
In some situations, you can use a [[Roth IRA]] as an emergency fund. You can withdraw contributions (that is, the money that you put into your Roth) at any time, and without taxes and penalties. This is not true of &lt;u&gt;earnings&lt;/u&gt; on your contributions, which are subject to more complex rules.

You can also withdraw penalty-free (but not tax-free) from a traditional IRA for certain excepted emergencies and major life events.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;For more, see [https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-publication-590-b IRS Publication 590-B]. For an easy-to-understand guide of the IRS's Roth IRA withdrawal regulations, see: [http://www.obliviousinvestor.com/roth-ira-withdrawal-rules/ Roth IRA Withdrawal Rules], by forum member ObliviousInvestor. and the [http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i5329.pdf Instructions for Form 5329].&lt;/ref&gt;

A Roth IRA is designed for retirement, not to store emergency funds. You should consider the effect using it as an emergency fund might have on your portfolio asset allocations, and also any custodial costs. There are also behavioral considerations.

If you need to make a choice between funding a Roth IRA and an emergency fund, you can use a Roth IRA as an emergency fund, but only ''in the appropriate situation''.&lt;ref&gt;For details, see {{forum link| t=45554| title=Should an Emergency Fund be in a Roth}}. If unsure, please ask for guidance - this is use of a retirement account for a different purpose.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, remember that funds in investment accounts (Roth IRA) are not immediately available. Check with the fund provider, as you may need several days to complete the fund transfer process.

==Health savings account as an emergency fund==
You can use a [[Health savings account|Health Savings Account]] (HSA) to pay for unexpected medical expenses tax-free, as long as they are qualified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p969.pdf| title=IRS Publication 969, Health Savings Accounts and Other Tax-Favored Health Plans| publisher=IRS| accessdate=June 6, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; Normally, non-medical (and unqualified medical) distributions from an HSA would be taxed as income and assessed an additional 20% penalty.

However, if medical expenses are qualified, incurred since the establishment of the HSA, paid out of pocket, and appropriately documented, they can be reimbursed in a future year. So you can keep a running tally of reimbursable expenses, allowing tax-free withdrawals along the same lines as Roth IRA contributions.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;This article's [[Talk:Emergency fund#Reader feedback: Use of an HSA as an emergency fund|Talk tab]] contains the complete details - including the relevant text from IRS Revenue Bulletin 2004-33 which states:
:"...a distribution from an HSA in the current year can be used to pay or reimburse expenses incurred in any prior year as long as the expenses were incurred after the HSA was established."&lt;/ref&gt;

Notice however that this strategy puts the shorter-term need for liquid, low-risk emergency funds in opposition to the longer-term tax savings of appreciated assets in the HSA. If you consider only part of the HSA to be emergency fund, the two parts (emergency fund and long-term growth) of the HSA should have different asset allocations, and you should track them carefully.

As with using Roth IRA contributions for emergencies, any withdrawals would permanently reduce your tax-advantaged 'space'. For that reason, and because HSA funds might not be available as quickly as bank accounts, you should probably consider HSA funds a 'later tier' of the total emergency fund. 

===Additional considerations===
If you are applying for financial aid for college or grad school, the FAFSA® (Free Application for Federal Student Aid) form excludes HSAs from income.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The balance in the account does not count as an asset, nor would distributions from it count as untaxed income when you use them for qualified medical expenses. Distributions not used for qualified expenses are subject to income tax (and a possible penalty) and will count as adjusted gross income.

      <text bytes="11404" sha1="5uauhssi8e0zzg91lslbdyqwqpf1ejv" xml:space="preserve">'''Record retention''' refers to the practices of maintaining personal financial records, particularly tax related documents.

==Why retain records?==
There are many reasons to keep records. In addition to tax purposes, you may need to keep records for [[insurance]] purposes or for getting a loan. Good records will help you:&lt;ref name="Pub552"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140417110507/http://www.irs.gov/publications/p552/ Publication 552 (01/2011), Recordkeeping for Individuals], from the IRS (archived).&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Identify sources of income.''' You may receive money or property from a variety of sources. Your records can identify the sources of your income. You need this information to separate business from nonbusiness income and taxable from nontaxable income.
*'''Keep track of expenses.''' You may forget an expense unless you record it when it occurs. You can use your records to identify expenses for which you can claim a deduction. This will help you determine if you can itemize deductions on your tax return.
*'''Keep track of the basis of property.''' You need to keep records that show the basis of your property. This includes the original cost or other basis of the property and any improvements you made.
*'''Prepare tax returns.''' You need records to prepare your tax return. Good records help you to file quickly and accurately.
*'''Support items reported on tax returns.''' You must keep records in case the IRS has a question about an item on your return.

==Records to keep==
The IRS does not require you to keep your records in a particular way. Keep them in a manner that allows you and the IRS to determine your correct tax.&lt;ref name="Pub552" /&gt;

*'''Copies of tax returns.''' You should keep copies of your tax returns as part of your tax records.

===Basic records===
Basic records are documents that everybody should keep. These are the records that prove your income and expenses. If you own a home or investments, your basic records should contain documents related to those items.&lt;ref name="Pub552" /&gt;

{| style="border-collapse: collapse;" border="1"
|+ '''Proof of Income and Expense'''
!! align="center" |'''FOR items concerning your...'''
!! align="center" | '''KEEP as basic records...'''

|}
*'''Income.''' Your basic records prove the amounts you report as income on your tax return. Your records also can prove that certain amounts are not taxable, such as tax-exempt interest. 
*'''Expenses.''' Your basic records prove the expenses for which you claim a deduction (or credit) on your tax return.
*'''Home.''' Your basic records should enable you to determine the basis or adjusted basis of your home. You need this information to determine if you have a gain or loss when you sell your home or to figure depreciation if you use part of your home for business purposes or for rent.
*'''Investments.''' Your basic records should enable you to determine your basis in an investment and whether you have a gain or loss when you sell it.
====Proof of payment====
One of your basic records is proof of payment. You should keep these records to support certain amounts shown on your tax return. Proof of payment alone is not proof that the item claimed on your return is allowable. You also should keep other documents that will help prove that the item is allowable.

Generally, you prove payment with a cash receipt, financial account statement, credit card statement, canceled check, or substitute check. If you make payments in cash, you should get a dated and signed receipt showing the amount and the reason for the payment.

===Specific records===
This section is an alphabetical list of some items that require specific records in addition to your basic records.&lt;ref name="Pub552" /&gt;

*'''Alimony.''' If you receive or pay alimony, you should keep a copy of your written separation agreement or the divorce, separate maintenance, or support decree.
*'''Business Use of Your Home.''' You may be able to deduct certain expenses connected with the business use of your home. 
*'''Casualty and Theft Losses.''' To deduct a casualty or theft loss, you must be able to prove that you had a casualty or theft. Your records also must be able to support the amount you claim.
*'''Child Care Credit.''' You must give the name, address, and taxpayer identification number for all persons or organizations that provide care for your child or dependent.
*'''Contributions.''' You must keep records to prove the contributions you make during the year. The kinds of records depend on whether the contribution is cash, noncash, or out-of-pocket expenses.
*'''Credit for the Elderly or the Disabled.''' If you are under age 65, you must have your physician complete a statement certifying that you were permanently and totally disabled on the date you retired. 
*'''Education Expenses.''' If you have the records to prove your expenses, you may be entitled to claim certain tax benefits for your education expenses.
*'''Exemptions.''' If you are claiming an exemption for your spouse or a dependent (a qualifying child or a qualifying relative), you must keep records that support the deduction.
*'''Employee Business Expenses.''' If you have employee business expenses, see Publication 463, Travel, Entertainment, Gift, and Car Expenses, for a discussion of what records to keep.
*'''Energy Incentives.''' If you want to claim one of the tax incentives for the purchase of energy-efficient products, you must keep records to prove: When and how you acquired the property, the purchase price of the property, and that the property qualified for the credit.
*'''Gambling Winnings and Losses.''' You must keep an accurate diary of your winnings and losses.
*'''Health Savings Account (HSA) and Medical Savings Account (MSA).''' For each qualified medical expense you pay with a distribution from your HSA or MSA, you must keep a record of the name and address of each person you paid and the amount and date of the payment.
*'''Medical and Dental Expenses.''' In addition to records you keep of regular medical expenses, you should keep records of transportation expenses that are primarily for and essential to medical care.
*'''Mortgage Interest.''' If you paid mortgage interest of $600 or more, you should receive Form 1098, Mortgage Interest Statement. Keep this form and your mortgage statement and loan information in your records.
*'''Moving Expenses.''' You may be able to deduct qualified moving expenses that are not reimbursed.
*'''Pensions and Annuities.''' Use the worksheet in your tax return instructions to figure the taxable part of your pension or annuity. Keep a copy of the completed worksheet until you fully recover your contributions.
*'''Taxes.''' Form(s) W-2 and Form(s) 1099-R show state income tax withheld from your wages and pensions. You should keep a copy of these forms to prove the amount of state withholding. If you made estimated state income tax payments, you need to keep a copy of the form or your check(s).
**You also need to keep copies of your state income tax returns. If you received a refund of state income taxes, the state may send you Form 1099-G, Certain Government Payments.
**Keep mortgage statements, tax assessments, or other documents as records of the real estate and personal property taxes you paid.
**If you deducted actual state and local general sales taxes instead of using the optional state sales tax tables, you must keep your actual receipts showing general sales taxes paid.
*'''Sales Tax on Vehicles.''' You may be able to deduct state and local sales and excise taxes (or certain other taxes or fees in a state without a sales tax) paid in 2010 for the purchase of a new motor vehicle after February 16, 2009, and before January 1, 2010. Keep your purchase contract to show much sales tax you paid.
*'''Tips.''' You must keep a daily record to accurately report your tips on your return.

==How long to keep records==
You must keep your records as long as they may be needed for the administration of any provision of the Internal Revenue Code. Generally, this means you must keep records that support items shown on your return until the period of limitations for that return runs out.&lt;ref name="Pub552" /&gt;

The period of limitations is the period of time in which you can amend your return to claim a credit or refund or the IRS can assess additional tax. The table below contains the periods of limitations that apply to income tax returns. Unless otherwise stated, the years refer to the period beginning after the return was filed. Returns filed before the due date are treated as being filed on the due date.

{| style="border-collapse: collapse;" border="1"
|+ '''Period of Limitations'''
!! align="center" | &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
!! align="center" |'''IF you...'''
!! align="center" | '''THEN the period is...'''
|-
||1 ||Owe additional tax and 2), (3), and (4) do not  apply to you ||3 years
|-
||2 || Do not report income that you should and it is more than 25% of the gross income shown on your return || 6 years
|-
||3 ||File a fraudulent return|| No limit
|-
||4 ||Do not file a return|| No limit
|-
||5 ||File a claim for credit or refund after you filed your return || The later of 3 years or 2 years after tax was paid
|-
||6 ||File a claim for a loss from worthless securities || 7 years
|}

'''Property.''' Keep records relating to property until the period of limitations expires for the year in which you dispose of the property in a taxable disposition. You must keep these records to figure your basis for computing gain or loss when you sell or otherwise dispose of the property. 

'''Keeping records for nontax purposes.''' When your records are no longer needed for tax purposes, do not discard them until you check to see if they should be kept longer for other purposes. Your insurance company or creditors may require you to keep certain records longer than the IRS does.

'''Paying down loans versus investing''' is an investment choice you may have if you have money available but you also have an outstanding loan. This article looks at the choice of how to deploy the money and the pros and cons to be considered.

==Viewing it as an investment choice==
If you have money that you could invest, but you also have a loan, you have the option of using the money to pay down the loan instead. Paying down the loan will give you a guaranteed return by reducing your future loan balance, and eventually eliminating future loan payments or giving you more money when the loan is paid off. This is the same benefit that you get from a fixed-income investment such as a [[Bond basics | bond]] or [[certificate of deposit]] (CD), which also gives you fixed amounts of money at specified future times. 

Therefore, it makes sense to treat paying down a loan like a bond investment, and compare this option to your other investment options.

'''Example''': You have a credit card with a $5,000 balance and an APR of 10%. Your current net worth is $20,000. You have received $1,000 in cash (which is included in the $20,000). You are deciding what to do with the cash.

* If you do nothing with that cash, the credit card's interest will make your net worth $19,500 in one year's time ($20,000 - 10% &amp;times; $5,000).
* If you use the $1,000 to pay down the credit card, your net worth will be $20,000 - $4,000 &amp;times; 10% = $19,600
* If you invest the $1,000 in a bond paying 5% (''after taxes''), your net worth will be $19,500 + $1,000 &amp;times; 5% = $19,550.
* If you invest the $1,000 in a bond paying 10% (''after taxes''), your net worth will be $19,500 + $1,000 &amp;times; 10% = $19,600.

As can be seen, paying down the credit card affects your net worth equivalently to investing in a risk-free asset with an after-tax return equal to the credit card's interest rate. Note the use of ''after-tax'' and ''risk-free'', as those are important considerations.

Be certain of your loan's payment terms and conditions. You may not be entitled to skip payments, or the interest due may not be what you expect. Read the contract. In addition, check your tax records to see whether you are actually deducting the loan interest; many homeowners take the standard deduction and thus get no tax deduction from the interest payment.

=== Calculating interest ===
Because there are several ways of calculating interest on loans (including how leap year is considered), the exact details may differ by small amounts. Bank and auto finance loans are probably very similar, but may not be identical.&lt;ref name="BH"&gt;{{forum link| t=87988| title=Paying loans early - differences between types of loans| author=dm200| date=January 1, 2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

As an example, take a $10,000.00 credit union loan at 6.00% interest rate for 48 months issued January 15, with the first payment due on February 15, and then on the 15th of succeeding months. The monthly payment would be $234.86 per month for 47 payments and a final payment of $234.71 and an approximate total interest of $1,273.13. The exact amount of interest depends on the exact amount paid and which day the payment is credited. Such consumer loans charge interest on the number of days and the outstanding balance each day.

On this loan, suppose you paid the $234.86 on the 10th of every month (five days early). Because this would slightly reduce the balance each month on the principal, overall interest would be less, resulting in a final (48th) payment of 224.31 - a savings of about $10.

As another example, suppose you chose to pay a little extra each month on the 15th. Say you paid $250.00 each month on the 15th. You would then pay off the loan with 44 payments of $250.00 and a 45th and final payment of $185.43. Total interest would be $1,185.43.

=== Loan prepayment ===
If you pay extra, do you still need to make the full monthly payment the next month? If you read all the fine print in the loan agreement, almost certainly the full payment is required each month. However, most credit unions - to some degree - allow paying early or extra to then allow skipping a month's payment. So, for example, if you make three payments in July, can you then skip August, September and October? Maybe or maybe not - all depends on the policies and practices of that credit union. Some credit unions will allow one, two or three months prepayment where you can then skip.&lt;ref name="BH" /&gt;

While mortgage loans could operate the same way, almost none do. Mortgages operate with somewhat different rules, practices and customs. Mortgages are almost always sold by the issuing credit union (or bank) or, if not actually sold, structured in a way where they could be sold. In almost all cases, interest is collected based on the amortization schedule - not actual days. So, for example, my mortgage payment is due the 1st of the month. BUT - whether I pay my January 1 due payment on December 25 (early) or January 10 (late, but within the grace period) - the interest paid is the same. For mortgages, if you want to pay extra to save interest, that must be specifically identified and credited according to the rules of the lender/servicer. When you pay extra and/or early to save interest, you still owe the full payment in succeeding months. One reason for mortgage loans being treated like this is that it better allows transfers and sale of mortgages from one institution to another that have very different data processing and crediting systems in place.

==Non-mathematical considerations==

=== Peace of mind ===
For many investors, the peace of mind from not having a loan is valuable. If you are in that situation, it may be worth paying off a loan at a small additional cost so that the loan will be gone. 

=== Simplicity ===

Once a loan is paid off, your life is simplified. The money budgeted for this loan can now be used elsewhere, such as investing.

===Liquidity===
If you use money to pay off a loan and then need money later, you cannot get it back without taking a new loan, probably at a higher interest rate (such as a home-equity loan rather than a first mortgage). Therefore, it is best to build a significant [[Emergency fund | emergency fund]] before paying down a mortgage, and not to use money for paying down the mortgage that you might need to spend on something else other than buying a new house. (However, if you add money to your [[Traditional IRA]] or [[401(k)]] rather than paying down the mortgage, you do not normally gain any liquidity advantage, since you generally cannot withdraw from the Traditional IRA or 401(k) without a penalty until you reach the appropriate age.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Withdrawals from a Traditional IRA will be subject to income tax. Early withdrawals are generally amounts distributed from your Traditional IRA account before you are age 59 1/2. You must pay a 10% additional tax on the distribution of any assets from your Traditional IRA before you are age 59 1/2.

:'''Exceptions to the penalty apply if the early withdrawal is:'''
:* made to a beneficiary or estate on account of the IRA owner's death,
:* made on account of disability,
:* made as part of a series of [[SEPP:Substantially_Equal_Periodic_Payments|substantially equal periodic payments]] over your life or life expectancy,
:* made to pay for a qualified first–time home purchase,
:* not above your qualified higher education expenses,
:* not above certain medical insurance premiums paid while unemployed,
:* not above your unreimbursed medical expenses that are more than a certain percentage of your adjusted gross income, or
:* due to an IRS levy.

For a Roth IRA, withdrawals of contributions can be withdrawn tax free, under the [[Roth IRA#Distributions |ordering rules]]. If the Roth IRA has passed the five year holding requirement, withdrawals of qualified earnings will be tax free for the following exceptions:
:* you become disabled, distributions attributable to your disability,
:* qualified first-time homebuyer distributions,
:* made to a beneficiary or estate on account of the IRA owner's death.

Penalty free and/or tax free early withdrawals from IRAs cannot be reinvested back into the IRA.
&lt;/ref&gt;)

To preserve liquidity, you might create a dedicated "loan payment" fund, invested in [[Municipal bonds |municipal]] or [[Treasury bonds|treasury]] bonds which always has enough money for you to pay down the loan.

=== Discipline ===

It requires financial discipline to direct money to savings, investment, or early loan payments instead of fun things.

Once you pay off the loan, if you redirect the freed-up loan payment cash flow to increased consumption, you will have no additional savings in the end.

=== Special considerations ===

If you have a student loan and might work for an employer which will forgive the loan (such as a federal or state government), do not pay it down early unless the rate is very high, as you will forfeit that benefit.

In addition, there are estate-planning considerations when deciding whether to pay off a loan. For example, credit cards are typically subject to collection after death, and yet federal student loans are discharged after death. As such, if you are planning an estate, it might not be useful to use assets to pay off federal student loans, as they would be discharged upon death (and ''not'' considered cancellation nor issued a 1099-C), and you would be better off investing those assets.

== Prerequisites ==

Before deciding to pay extra to retire debt early you should make sure you understand your financial situation. Is your [[Household budgeting|household budget]] in order? Do you have an [[emergency fund]] established, and enough extra cash flow to make a difference in your loans?

==Guidelines for making the choice==
Usually, you should pay down the loan if the after-tax interest rate on the loan is significantly higher than the after-tax rate you can earn on a comparable bond investment (a low-risk bond investment with duration equal to the time until you will pay off the loan), and you can pay the loan down without any liquidity problems.

Here is the most likely order of priority for investments versus paying off loans; it does depend on the rates, so these examples are based on typical rates which may not be accurate at any specific time.

*Invest in 401(k) to get maximum employer match (rate may be over 100% in the first year)
*Pay down credit cards (rate 10-30+%)
*Pay down non-deductible auto or student loans, or other medium-rate loans (rate 5-8%)
*Invest in [[Roth IRA]], deductible IRA or decent 401(k) (rate 5% on Treasury bonds)
*Pay down deductible mortgage or student loans (rate 4% after tax)
*Invest in taxable account (rate 4% on municipal bonds)
*Do not pay down subsidized loans as long as subsidy lasts (rate 0-3%)

===Why use bond returns for comparison?===
While you may have a higher expected return by investing in stocks, or in a mixed stock/bond allocation, rather than in bonds, that return comes with a higher risk. Unless your investments are 100% in stocks, you can choose to take a higher risk whether or not you pay down your loan, because you can sell bonds and buy stock. Therefore, a fair comparison is between paying down the loan and a bond investment with the same risk. 

One way to look at the comparison is to consider the following choices.

# Invest the money with your preferred allocation.
# Invest the money in bonds.
# Pay down the loan and move an equal amount of money from bonds to your preferred allocation.
# Pay down the loan and leave the investments unchanged.

The choice between 3 and 4, while difficult, is one you have already made; you decided how much risk you were willing to take, and chose your stock/bond allocation. And the choice between 1 and 3, or between 2 and 4, is much simpler; if you pay a higher interest rate on the loan than you would by investing in bonds, you will come out ahead by paying down the loan. If you prefer 3 to 1 (higher rate on the loan), then you prefer 4 to 1 also and should pay down the loan. If you prefer 2 to 4 (higher rate on bonds), then you should invest the money according to whichever of 1 or 2 you prefer.

===What type of bonds are comparable?===
Paying down a fixed-rate loan gives you a guaranteed, zero-risk return, since it reduces an existing liability. Therefore, it should be compared to a bond with no credit risk. If you would be investing the money in an IRA or 401(k), the best comparison is a Treasury bond; if you would be investing in a taxable account, the best comparison is a high-quality municipal bond, which has almost no risk and usually has better after-tax returns. 
Note that you are generally best off putting stocks in your taxable account and bonds in tax-deferred accounts -- see [[Principles of tax-efficient fund placement]] for more information.

If your loan is at a fixed rate, the proper comparison is to a bond with duration equal to the time it will take you to pay off the loan, because that is how long it will take you to realize the benefit. For example, if you pay an extra $1,000 on your 6% mortgage, the reduced mortgage balance will decrease by 6% a year, compounded annually (but all the gains are taxable). If there are ten years left on your mortgage, you will reduce your final payment by $1,791, so your prepayment is effectively a ten-year bond. If there are more than ten years left but you sell the house in ten years, you will get an extra $1,791 after the loan is paid off, so it is again a ten-year bond.

If your loan is at a variable rate, the proper comparison is to a short-term bond even if it will take you a long time to pay off the loan, because you will be effectively reinvesting your savings every year at rates tied to short-term rates. For example, if your mortgage rate is 1% above the one-year Treasury bill rate, and you pay off the mortgage in ten years, your pre-tax gain will be 10.5% more than the rate of one-year Treasury bills reinvested for ten years because of compounding, no matter what happens to Treasury rates during the next ten years.

While paying down the loan gives a zero-risk return, you will still face risk from the potential change in value of an asset (such as a house) you purchased with the proceeds of the loan -- but that risk would still exist if you had purchased the asset with cash.

===What is the effective rate?===
If your loan interest is tax-deductible, the after-tax rate to use for comparison is the actual rate, reduced by a percentage equal to your tax bracket. For example, if your mortgage is at 6% and you are in a 30% tax bracket, the after-tax rate is 4.2% = 6% - (30% &amp;times; 6%); paying down $10,000 and reducing the interest by $600 would increase your tax bill by $180. (Even if you would lose the opportunity to itemize deductions if you paid off the whole loan, treat any partial payment as a fully taxable investment, because you have to eliminate the deductible interest first before you can pay off enough to eliminate non-deductible interest.)

As another example, the first $2,500 you pay in interest on a student loan is tax-deductible up to a certain income level. Suppose you have a $60,000 student loan at 5% interest, so that you will owe $3,000 of interest next year; you deduct $2,500 of interest, reducing your tax bill by $375 if you are in a 15% tax bracket ($375 = ($3,000 &amp;times; 15%) - ($3,000 - $2,500) &amp;times; 15%). If you pay down $10,000, you reduce the interest to $2,500, and you still get the full deduction, so your benefit is the full $500 for an effective rate of 5%. But if you pay down yet another $10,000, you reduce the interest to $2000, and you lose a $500 deduction, increasing your tax bill by $75. Thus, the second $10,000 payment earns you only $425, for an effective rate of 4.25% on this payment.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The ''effective rate'' is the annual rate of interest when compounding occurs more than once per year. See: [http://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/effectiveinterest.asp Effective Annual Interest Rate], from Investopedia.&lt;/ref&gt;

===If the decision is close===
If, by the sheer numbers, the decision is close, it may be better to keep the loan.&lt;ref name="Close Decision"&gt;{{forum link| t=113520| title=Decision on wiki: Paying Loans vs. Investing| author=assumer| date=March 26, 2013}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The benefits of paying off the loan would be:
* [[Paying_down_loans_versus_investing#Peace_of_Mind|Psychological benefits]]
* Reduced minimum monthly payments, which could be useful in an emergency situation.
* Tax-free return.

The benefits of keeping the loan and investing in bonds would be:
* [[Paying_down_loans_versus_investing#Liquidity|Liquidity]] (you can likely choose to sell the bonds and pay the loan off at any time)
* If interest rates fall, you can likely refinance the loan at a lower rate.
* Fixed-rate loans (for example, mortgages) can offer inflation protection (if inflation rises, you are still only paying the same nominal amount per month).
* If the choice is between investing in tax-advantage accounts (for example, a 401(k) or IRA) and paying down the loan, investing in the 401(k) or IRA will give you more tax-deferred investments, which will remain valuable even after you have paid off the loan, and these accounts have annual contribution limits.

      <text bytes="32701" sha1="gwi7qoz936knlex409viaobh7avvqai" xml:space="preserve">'''Life-cycle finance''' begins with the premise that households prefer relatively smooth consumption from year-to-year and have a strong dislike for abrupt shifts in consumption, particularly on the downside. In economics, this premise is known as ''consumption smoothing'' (described [[#Consumption smoothing|below]]). Therefore; in economic life-cycle saving &amp; investing, personal finance is mainly about moving consumption through time and across contingencies. This requires also shifting financial and insurance assets through time and across contingencies.&lt;ref name="bobcat2notes"&gt;Supplied via PM to LadyGeek. Submitted for forum review March 14, 2014. See: [https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=1995692#p1995692 Re: Wade Pfau: Lifecycle Finance], direct link to post.&lt;/ref&gt;

In this paradigm, consumers are quite serious about setting financial goals and meeting those goals by saving, borrowing, and insuring. ''How'' the savings are invested depends on many things, including whether they are on track to meeting a goal.&lt;ref name="bobcat2notes" /&gt;

==Overview==

People seek to smooth spending over their lifetimes in order to obtain the greatest satisfaction from their limited resources, and the problem to be solved is how high this standard of living can be. Because salary, household composition, taxes, mortgage payments, and so forth, vary so dramatically over a household's lifecycle, trying to target basic rules of thumb related to replacement rates, wealth accumulation targets, savings rates, or withdrawal rates, can end up causing more harm than good.&lt;ref name="MoneyWatch"&gt;[http://www.marketwatch.com/story/lifecycle-finance-upending-the-old-retirement-rules-2014-02-20 Lifecycle finance: Upending the old retirement rules], Wade Pfau, on MoneyWatch.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;An example of a ''rule of thumb'' is the [[Safe withdrawal rates | Safe withdrawal rate]].&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, savings rates generally do not need to be fixed at some level, as it is the spending level which should be fixed. Savings (or dissavings) is what remains after accounting for all income and expenses in any given year. This creates a real disconnect as most of the discussion regarding retirement deals with rules of thumb which are anathema to practitioners of lifecycle finance.&lt;ref name="MoneyWatch" /&gt;

Here are some examples:&lt;ref name="bobcat2notes" /&gt;

===Example #1: A young couple buys a house by taking out a mortgage===

They are pulling financial assets from the future into the present to afford a nice house that they could not purchase simply from their current income and financial wealth. But they are also each contributing to a 401k plan and pushing current assets far into their retired future when they will have no labor income to support their consumption.

They purchase health insurance to move purchasing power across contingencies – from periods of good health to periods of bad health. They each purchase enough term life insurance so that in the contingency that one of them dies, the survivor is able to keep the same level of per capita consumption.

They set aside liquid funds for the contingency that one of them could become involuntarily unemployed, and thereby shift assets from good employment times to bad employment times.

===Example #2: Saving for retirement===

A middle aged couple saves and invests heavily for retirement and also pushes assets from the present into their retired future. Conversely, a retired couple pulls financial assets from the past into the present by drawing down financial assets or dissaving.

The retired couple has a safe floor of retirement income from SS and life annuity income to support a minimum acceptable level of consumption in retirement. Risky assets are used both prior and during retirement to move from the safe floor income goal to the higher aspirational retirement income goal.

==Consumption smoothing==
If you are below your consumption needs, you are borrowing funds to make up the difference. This is what usually happens when you get out of school - borrowing to pay off loans and carry a mortgage. In mid-life, you are above the line and saving funds - paying off loans and the mortgage. In retirement, you are drawing from your retirement funds.

The mid-life dip below the consumption line is an unexpected event, such as the loss of a job. In this situation, you may be borrowing from an [[Emergency fund | emergency fund ]] to maintain your lifestyle until a new job is found.

Dissaving is negative saving. If spending is greater than income, dissaving is taking place. This spending is financed by already accumulated savings, such as money in a savings account, or it can be borrowed.&lt;ref&gt;[[wikipedia:Dissaving|Dissaving]], on Wikipedia.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Risk management==
{{Main|Investment risk management|Matching strategy}}
Risk is managed in life-cycle finance using hedging, insuring, and diversifying. Important minimum goals are met by hedging and insuring using matching strategies. Higher aspirational goals are met by diversifying.&lt;ref name="bobcat2notes" /&gt;

Risk strategies that rely on hedging and insuring are called ''matching strategies'' because they match assets to liabilities. Risk strategies based on diversifying are simply called ''diversification strategies''.

==Differences between life-cycle and mean/variance approaches==
Life-cycle finance is about moving assets across time and contingencies to keep consumption on a relatively smooth trajectory over a household’s entire life-cycle. It is not about leveling or flattening consumption over the household’s life-cycle. That would require an extreme amount of borrowing when people are young, which is neither desirable nor feasible in most cases. Economists jargon for this is that households are “borrowing constrained”.&lt;ref name="bobcat2notes" /&gt;

Life-cycle finance posits that a household saves, borrows, and ensures to keep consumption relatively smooth over its lifetime by moving assets through time and across contingencies. This is different than conventional financial planning that argues that households should save a lot every year, invest those savings at the highest expected return possible given their risk tolerance, and use that high expected wealth to address retirement, children’s education, and life contingencies that crop up.&lt;ref name="bobcat2notes" /&gt;

The above conventional point of view is seen as both unrealistic and undesirable. It leads to big swings in spending (consumption disruption) and high expected returns do not necessarily result in high actual returns. This means that investing in risky assets should be mainly reserved to aspirational goals and safer investing and insuring should be used to meet minimum acceptable goals.&lt;ref name="bobcat2notes" /&gt;

For at least the last 35 years financial economists have approached personal investing from the life-cycle finance point of view. Most financial advisors and investment enthusiasts approach personal investing loosely from the mean/variance approach to investing that was developed by financial economists in the 1950s and 1960s. Many decades ago in financial economics that approach was superseded by the life-cycle approach, which treats the earlier mean/variance approach as a relatively unrealistic special case of the life-cycle approach to personal investing.&lt;ref name="bobcat2"&gt;[http://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&amp;t=134471&amp;p=1986130#p1983653 Re: Wade Pfau: Lifecycle Finance] by forum member bobcat2, direct link to post.&lt;/ref&gt;

While there is a lot of overlap, there are also some significant differences between the two investment approaches. Life-cycle finance is much more goal focused than the older method.&lt;ref name="bobcat2" /&gt; 

Take retirement planning goals. In the conventional approach the goal is to maximize expected financial wealth in your targeted retirement year, given how much you are willing to save, and how much investment risk you can tolerate. From the life-cycle point of view, the overall goal of retirement planning is to have roughly the same standard of living in retirement as before retirement. Therefore the retirement financial goal is to have reliable retirement income that sustains your standard of living.&lt;ref name="bobcat2" /&gt;

The way the income goal is usually framed is by pricing real annuities that supply the retirement income target and not by applying arbitrary rules like 4% of financial assets at retirement converted to income every year.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Also known as the [[Safe withdrawal rates|Safe withdrawal rate]].&lt;/ref&gt;

A stress is put on having two income goals. One is the aspirational income goal and the other is a lower floor income goal that is constructed entirely from relatively safe assets such as SS, DB pensions, life annuities, and TIPS and I-bonds.&lt;ref name="bobcat2" /&gt;

Another key difference is how risk is managed, which is implicitly alluded to in the above aspirational and safe income goals.

In the older conventional framework investment risk is almost entirely managed thru diversification. In the life-cycle approach all three risk transfer methods (hedging, insuring, and diversifying) are used without particular stress on diversifying. In other words the life-cycle approach relies explicitly on both matching strategies and the conventional diversification strategy in managing investment risk.

Additionally, in the conventional framework risk is hardly ever approached thru a state price approach, but the state price approach to risk is often used in life-cycle finance.&lt;ref name="bobcat2" /&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;''State price:'' In financial economics, a state-price security is a contract that agrees to pay one unit of a currency if a particular state occurs at a particular time in the future and pays nothing in all the other states. The price of this security is the state price of this particular state of the world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

In short, the risk in risky assets tends to show up at the worst possible times. Thus you don't want to fund your financial future betting on risky assets and nothing going wrong with the economy or your health. Instead you should have a combination of risky financial assets, relatively safe financial assets, and insurance so that regardless of the future financial state you actually live in, you have a reasonable chance for an acceptable financial life. See: [http://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=1889776#p1889776 Re: Free Stanford Course: Finance of Retirement &amp; Pensions], by bobcat2.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

The practical idea here is that when planning our financial future we want to think of possible likely states of our world and how we will address these contingencies. We might in the next few years be in good health, but we could be in poor health. We might be fully employed with big salary increases, but we might become involuntarily unemployed. How do we intend to address each of those possible states of our financial world? Life-cycle finance incorporates this point-of-view, which was first developed by Kenneth Arrow in the 1950s, that an investor should consider alternative future outcomes and the amount of consumption obtained in each possible situation. See: [http://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=1991354#p1991354 Re: Wade Pfau: Lifecycle Finance], by bobcat2. &lt;/ref&gt;

Quantitative analysis also has a different emphasis. Go to a conventional financial advisor and he will often talk about Monte Carlo simulations of the portfolio. Go to an advisor steeped in the life-cycle approach and she will analyze the problem, at least informally, through the lens of dynamic programming.&lt;ref name="bobcat2" /&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;One approach to finding the smoothest consumption path is called ''dynamic programming'' which solves complex problems by breaking them down into a series of simpler, but overlapping, "sub-problems." The smallest problem is solved first, and each increasingly more difficult problem is solved in sequence.[1]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Overlapping sub-problems are present in ''consumption smoothing'' because each period's budget constraint of ''how much'' to consume and save in each period, given the level of income and assets, depends on the solutions to all of the later periods' budget constraints.[1]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

To this end, the dynamic program for ''consumption smoothing'' begins at the last period (the small one period problem) and works backwards period-by-period to the initial period (the most difficult problem which involves all the periods).[1]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Another definition: Dynamic programming is an approach to optimization that restates a multiperiod or multistep optimization problem in recursive form.[2]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

===Why the life-cycle finance approach gives a higher probability of reaching the retirement goal===

There are many variations on Life-Cycle Finance but all share the following two features. There is a conservative or floor income goal and a higher desired or aspirational income goal.&lt;ref name="bobcat2-1"&gt;[http://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=2009655#p2009655 Wade Pfau: Lifecycle Finance] by bobcat2, direct link to post.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several years before retirement you get on track to reach the floor goal by a combination of current size of safe assets, plus expected return on safe assets, plus future expected savings dedicated to safe assets.

The higher desired goal in general is achieved thru a combination of risky and low risk assets that in some manner is more aggressively rebalanced than the traditional rebalancing to a constant mix strategy. In addition, the rebalancing is asymmetric.

Now compare the two methods – Mean / Variance and Life-Cycle Finance. The Mean / Variance method starts a year at 60/40. After a very good year for stocks, like 2013, the portfolio is rebalanced back to the constant mix of 60/40. If stocks have a bad year, the constant mix strategy again rebalances back to 60/40, but this time moving assets from bonds to stocks.

Now look at 2013 using the Life-Cycle Finance approach, where again the year started at 60/40. Stocks have that great year in 2013. If we were on target to hit the aspirational level of retirement income with acceptable probability at the beginning of 2013, then it must be the case that we are now ahead of schedule. So instead of rebalancing to 60/40 the rebalancing might be to 57/43, so that we are now on track to meet the goal with higher probability. The higher probability of meeting the goal is due both to the bigger than expected portfolio size this year, and lower portfolio risk going forward. In the MV approach using constant mix rebalancing, we have increased the probability of exceeding the goal, but increased the probability of meeting the goal only slightly. In the Life-Cycle Finance approach we haven’t increased the probability of exceeding the goal, but we have increased the probability of at least meeting the goal more than in the ''Mean / Variance'' approach.

When stocks do poorly the rebalancing done by Mean / Variance would again be back to 60/40, but in the case of Life-Cycle Finance it might be more like 62/38 or 63/37. Since the portfolio is smaller than expected, we are now behind schedule for meeting our income goal, and we compensate by raising both risk and expected return. If we fall further behind and the probability of reaching our income goals drops too low, because of both small portfolio size and increased portfolio risk, we will reach the boundary on increasing portfolio risk as the probability of reaching the floor income goal drops below the acceptable range. At that point we will need to increase savings or postpone retirement to reach our income goals. A third alternative would be to plan to increase annuitization at retirement. In any case this multifaceted strategy has higher probability of reaching the goal than simple constant mix rebalancing.

Now we could adjust the [[Asset allocation |asset allocation]] over time in line with changing financial conditions, increase saving, postpone retirement, or plan to increase annuitization using the ''Mean / Variance'' approach. But these options are typically not explicitly in the ''Mean / Variance'' approach. They are instead added in an ad hoc fashion, once the plan is far off course. Using goal focused Life-Cycle Finance, these options are baked into the plan in order to stay on course to meeting the goal over time as we approach retirement.

By both planning for a floor and aggressively rebalancing the Life-Cycle Finance approach produces a strategy that gives a higher probability of at least reaching the aspirational income goal, but at the cost of conceding the chances of meaningfully exceeding the goal. The Mean / Variance approach produces a strategy that has some probability of exceeding the goal, but a lower probability of at least meeting the goal. The “or more” than the goal has value, and the Life-Cycle Finance approach employs that value to increase the probability of meeting the goal.

Now a financial engineer can accomplish what has been laid out as a Life-Cycle Finance strategy in a manner more economically efficient than the method just described. Nevertheless, you can use the method outlined above in practice, or simply use it as a way of thinking about what is going on in Life-Cycle Finance methods in order to achieve a goal with high probability.

===Introductory articles===
Nationally there are perhaps only two dozen financial planners that follow the life-cycle approach rather than the conventional approach based on the older MPT paradigm. Probably the best known of these planners is Paula Hogan, who is based in Milwaukee. Paula has written several articles on the differences between the conventional MPT approach and the life-cycle approach. Her articles are very accessible to lay readers, which is something that can't be said of many of the papers by economists written on life-cycle household economics.&lt;ref name="bobcat2"&gt;[http://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&amp;t=134471&amp;p=1986130#p1983653 Re: Wade Pfau: Lifecycle Finance] by forum member bobcat2, direct link to post.&lt;/ref&gt;

Here are links to several of Paula's articles that discuss these two approaches to personal finance and highlight the differences.

Here are articles by three prominent economists on the life-cycle approach which are accessible to investment enthusiasts.&lt;ref name="bobcat2" /&gt;

The first is from Robert Merton, one of the fathers of life-cycle economics, writing in the ''Financial Analysts Journal''. The second is by Larry Kotlikoff writing in the ''Journal of Financial Planning''. The third is Zvi Bodie's paper from 2002. In addition there is Bodie's short companion piece to this article,

Chief among these is how much to save for retirement and how to invest those savings. The paper suggests ways that advances in the theory of finance combined with innovations in financial contracting technology might be used to improve social welfare by designing and producing a new generation of user-friendly life-cycle products for consumers. It contrasts the old Markowitz single-period paradigm of efficient diversification with a new Mertonian paradigm that takes account of multi-period hedging, labor supply flexibility, and habit formation.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Papers and articles====
In 1985 Franco Modigliani won the Nobel Prize in Economics primarily for his pioneering work on the life-cycle hypothesis. In many ways he is the father of life-cycle economics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/1985/ The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel] was awarded to Professor Franco Modigliani, October 15, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory of life-cycle economics in its modern state began with companion papers by Paul Samuelson and his student Robert Merton in 1969.&lt;ref name="bobcat2" /&gt; These papers brought rigorous dynamics into Modigliani’s life-cycle hypothesis. Samuelson’s paper dealt with the discrete time case using stochastic dynamic programming. Merton dealt with the more difficult case of continuous time using optimal control methods to deal with continuous stochastic variation.&lt;ref name="bobcat2" /&gt; These early papers used advanced math techniques and later research relies on math that is more advanced than these methods. While the math to prove these things is difficult, the underlying ideas are fairly intuitive.&lt;ref name="bobcat2" /&gt;

What makes this difficult is the dynamic nature of these problems. The decisions I make this year affect this year’s outcome and next year’s decisions, and next year’s outcome. This continues to play out this way for every year of my life from now until when I die.&lt;ref name="bobcat2" /&gt;

There have been many papers since these 1969 papers that have updated and refined  the connection between human capital and the life-cycle model. In particular the best known and most influential of those papers, "Labor Supply Flexibility and Portfolio Choice in a Life-Cycle Model", by Bodie, Merton, and William Samuelson (Paul's son) written in 1992.

The economic literature on household life-cycle economics over the last 40 years is voluminous, but the above is a good start.
Life-Cycle Economics is pretty central to the modern economics of the household and the consumer. Seven Nobel prize winners are on these lists of authors. In every case their work on life-cycle economics was a core portion of their research.

It means that you should try to spend less than you earn. In other words, you should have money left over at the end of the month. You can use this left over money to build an [[emergency fund]], and then as savings to invest. If you do this correctly, you will still have the things you really need to be happy.

Establishing a [[household budget]] is an important step in ''living below your means'' as it provides visibility on income and expenses.

But ''living below your means'' means more than just balancing your budget. It is important to know the difference between what you ''need'' and what you ''want''.

You can find a lot of good advice on the internet. For instance the wikiHow article "''How to Live Within Your Means''" discusses ways to build a balanced budget, and offers a perspective on spending and reducing your expenses.&lt;ref name="wikihow"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.wikihow.life/Live-Within-Your-Means| title=How to Live Within Your Means| author=Samantha Gorelick| publisher=wikiHow| date=October 26, 2021| accessdate=August 15, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==  Maintaining a balanced budget ==
{{Main|Household budgeting}}

People establish a household budget to understand their cash flow - how much they make, and how much they spend. A budget can help you plan for purchases and establish savings to reach your financial goals. Budgets are often essential for people who want to keep spending under control. 

The Bogleheads approach to developing a workable [[financial planning|financial plan]] is to have a sensible [[household budget]] - one that provides for needed expenditures, discretionary pleasures, savings for big ticket items, and savings for long term retirement planning. 

Some example action points from the wikiHow site&lt;ref name="wikihow" /&gt; and others: 
* Create a list of essential spending. Record all of your expenditures, both fixed and flexible
* Record or estimate your income from all sources 
* Compare your income to your expenditures
* Evaluate your expenditures, and challenge them: "Watch the pennies and the dollars will look after themselves."
* Boost your income where possible
* Set yourself saving goals and stick to them: Save and invest a percentage of every paycheck, not just what is left after expenses. Start [[Importance of saving early|saving early]].
* Avoid credit and loans. Avoid paying non-deductible interest on anything other than your home mortgage

==  Adjusting your perspective on spending ==

Some example action points from the wikiHow site&lt;ref name="wikihow" /&gt; and others: 
* Distinguish between what you want and what you need
* Do not try to "keep up with the Joneses"
* Change your definition of what it means to be "rich" 
* Know that spending less money will not decrease your quality of life
* Be grateful for what you ''do'' have

==  Reducing expenses ==

Perhaps the most important idea underlying the [[Bogleheads® investment philosophy]] is recognizing you need to save a significant portion of income every month to have enough money for a comfortable retirement. There is no substitute for spending less than you earn. Reduce expenses and unneeded debt so you can consistently set aside a portion of earnings for decades. If you do not save enough, no amount of financial trickery will provide the returns you need for a comfortable retirement.
 
Some example action points from the wikiHow site&lt;ref name="wikihow" /&gt; and others: 
* Eat at home whenever you can
* Entertain at home instead of going out
* Cancel any subscriptions you no longer need
* Borrow items whenever you can
* Wait for sales
* Do not ever shop without a list
* Pay "cash" for your purchases, avoid credit. Pay off your credit cards monthly.
* Wait 48 hours before making a big purchase

Financial planning covers day-to-day finances, budgeting, insurance, loan management, education, taxes, estate planning, investments, charitable giving, and retirement planning. As such, an investment plan is considered part of the financial plan.
{{Quotation|If you don't know where you are going, you'll end up someplace else.|Yogi Berra}}
The first and most important step is identifying objectives and their timelines. ''Financial planning'' then proceeds methodically to lay out ''how'' to achieve these objectives.&lt;ref name ="FinPlan" /&gt;

==Basic steps==
There are a few basic financial steps that are important to get correct early: 

* Financial planning '''starts with a sound financial lifestyle''' ([[Video:_Start_with_a_Sound_Financial_Lifestyle|Video]]).
* '''Track your expenses and stay within your budget'''. ([[Household budgeting]]). 
* '''Is your needed [[insurance]] coverage up to date?''' 
* '''Pay down bad debt''' (credit cards, other high interest debt). Paying off a 20% interest rate credit card debt will free up your money far faster than purchasing a stock fund.  With very low interest rate loans, it is often better to make minimum loan payments while investing the rest.
* '''Start saving for the emergency fund'''. Once you have debt under control, create an [[Emergency fund |emergency fund]]. Do not skip this step!  An established emergency fund can provide an individual with needed funds whenever an unforeseen event occurs so that you do not need to tap investments held for long term goals. 
* '''Take advantage of any employer match''' on a retirement savings plan even as you work towards the above goals.

With these basics started, you are ready for the next steps and to create a full finance plan, which will also revisit each of the above topics.

== Introduction: Elements of a financial plan ==
A financial plan usually begins with a summary of the current financial situation, including [[Net worth|net worth]], a list of income and expenditures, and a [[Household budgeting | budget]]. 

Following this snapshot, the plan may address issues and make recommendations in seven key areas:&lt;ref name="finiki" /&gt;

*Day-to-day finances (budgeting, expense control, mortgages, other debt, emergency funds, etc.)
*Insurance ([[Life Insurance| life]], [[:Category:Health insurance | health]], [[Disability insurance | disability]], [[Homeowner's insurance | property]])
*Education ([[529 plans]])
*Taxes (exemptions, deferrals, income splitting)
*[[:Category:Estate planning | Estate]] (wills, powers of attorney, use of trusts, planned giving, etc.)
*Investments ([[Asset allocation | asset allocation]], security selection, [[Risk and return: an introduction | risk management]])
*Retirement ([[Defined Benefit Pension Plan | pensions]], [[401(k)]], [[Social Security]], [[:Category:Annuities | annuities]], etc.)
:*Note: The [[Checklist of important retirement dates]] lists age specifications affecting retirement plans, social security, college funding, and health savings accounts. 

Not all financial plans include recommendations for all of these topics. For example, a retired person with a mortgage-free residence and a pension that covers day to day expenses may want and need advice only with respect to investments, taxes, and estate planning.

==Step 1+2: Establish goals and gather data==
The initial and most important step is identifying objectives (in a family, ''agreeing'' on shared objectives), e.g. buying a house, retiring early, ensuring that children get an excellent education, and so on. Determining ''what'' the objectives are, and ''when'' you would like to meet them, is primary. Since ''what'' usually requires money in the modern world, financial planning then proceeds methodically to lay out ''how''.&lt;ref name="finiki"&gt;[[finiki:Creating a financial plan|Creating a financial plan]] from [[finiki:Main Page|finiki]], the Canadian financial Wiki. Modified for US.&lt;/ref&gt;

Planning includes significant financial life events, such as:
*When your pension and employer retirement plan contributions become vested. 
*When a mortgage will be paid off.
*When children will be in college.
*When kids move out and become financially independent.
*A child's wedding as a possible large expense.
*The death of a spouse; your own future incapacity.

==Step 3: Analyze and evaluate your financial status==
{{Main|:Category:Personal finance|Household budgeting|l1=Personal Finance}}

After establishing goals and organizing data, you can now evaluate personal finances. What areas need focus? Consider as a minimum:

*Evaluate your day-to-day finances. Are you [[living below your means]]?
*Have you established an [[Emergency fund |emergency fund]]?
*Are taxes under control?
*Do you have adequate[[:Category:Insurance | insurance]]; such as life, health, disability, property?
*Is your[[Estate planning | estate planning]] up to date?  Proper estate planning ''is essential'' to ensure that your finances do not get derailed due to unforeseen circumstances. Do you have: a will or living trust, living will, Power of Attorney, medical Power of Attorney? Have you established guardians for minor children? Some situations may also need [[Asset protection |asset protection]].
*Is your [[preparing for retirement | retirement planning]], 401(k), pension, Social Security, IRA on track?

==Step 4: Develop a plan==
{{Main|Household budgeting|Investment policy statement|Budget models of retirement spending|Safe Withdrawal Rates}}
Make a list of things to do:

*Create a realistic budget with adequate insurance
*Plan for paying off existing credit card debts and other loans
*Plan for building an adequate emergency fund
*Plan for saving to meet your goals, develop the investment plan
**The time horizon will define your investing strategy (dream home, retirement, college)
**Understand your need, willingness and ability to take investment risk
**Design a disciplined savings program
**Document this in your Investment Policy Statement (IPS) or in the simpler [[Investment Policy Statement#Investing plan | Investment plan]]
*Create an estate plan

In retirement, the focus changes from ''saving'' to ''spending.'' The above items still apply, but with an objective to ensure that funds last as long as possible ("capital preservation"). 

Professional assistance may be required in the following areas:
*See a Certified Public Account to help with your taxes, if needed.
*See an estate planning attorney. Be sure the attorney is qualified to practice ''Elder Law'' and is experienced with the laws of your state.

==Step 5: Implement the plan==
===Prepare to invest===
* '''Track your expenses and stay within your budget'''. Investing starts with a sound financial lifestyle. The first step is to decide if you are ''able'' to invest. Do you have enough left over, after living expenses for investing? Have you updated needed insurance coverage? In order to invest, budget a certain portion of your income for investing.
* '''Pay off credit card debt and loans'''. If you discover that you have no funds available for investing, remember that investing is what you do ''after'' you have paid off credit card debts and other high interest loans. Paying off a 20% interest rate credit card debt will free up your money far faster than purchasing a stock fund.  With very low interest rate loans, it is often better to make minimum loan payments while continuing to invest.
* '''Complete saving for the emergency fund'''. Once you have debt under control, create an [[Emergency fund |emergency fund]]. A minimum of six months of living expenses (preferably more) is recommended, especially for non-retired individuals. Do not skip this step!  An established emergency fund can provide an individual with needed funds whenever an unforeseen event occurs. Examples of unfortunate events include loss of employment, temporary health impairments, large ticket repair items, and any other unforeseen financial contingency. An emergency fund allows you to meet such expense obligations with liquid funds, so that you do not need to tap investments held for long term goals. Once this is in place, you are ready to invest.

===Implement the investment plan===
{{Main|Investment policy statement}}
{{Notice |
Note the distinction between an ''investment plan'' and a ''financial plan''. An investment plan is typically part of a financial plan.
}}
The following items are the components of an investment plan.

1. '''Investment goals'''. The investment objectives (''what'' the money is for) and time horizon (''when'' you will need it) define the securities used to create the investment portfolio. For example, when [[Investing with a medium-term timeline|investing with a medium-term timeline]] you should not purchase a 5 year CD when you need the money in 3 years.&lt;ref group="note"&gt; Investment authorities commonly advise investors with goals coming due within five years to restrict investments to short term instruments such as bank CDs, money market funds, and short term treasury securities that all mature by the time the funds are needed. Longer term goals can include asset classes that fluctuate in price.&lt;/ref&gt; 

2. '''For long term financial goals, such as funding college costs for young children and funding a retirement, devise a suitable investment plan'''. For long term investments, the key decisions will involve  what [[:Category:Asset classes |asset classes]] should be selected; in what proportions ([[Asset allocation|asset allocation]]); and how these should be adjusted over time. 

3. '''Since many asset classes can rise and fall in value, you must understand your need, willingness, and ability to take investment risk.''' Since [[Risk and return: an introduction|risk]] and return are directly related, your asset allocation should balance your NEED to take risk with your ABILITY to withstand the ups and downs of the market. NEED can be determined in many different ways. If you are young, you have the benefit of many years of compounding, so in one respect your NEED to take risk is low. On the other hand, your portfolio size is probably small, leaving you with a long way to go to reach your retirement goals. As a result, you could argue that your NEED to take risk is high.&lt;ref name="laura"&gt;{{forum link| p=76190| title=Investment Planning| author=Laura}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

For people closer to retirement, it may be possible to more closely determine NEED. First, estimate approximately how much income you will need annually after retirement. For this example, we assume you need $100,000 per year. Next, look at any pensions or social security benefits that will provide a source of income. If a pension provides $30,000 per year and social security provides an additional $20,000 per year, then your portfolio would need to provide an extra $50,000 each year. To prevent running out of money, you should probably start by withdrawing 4% a year or less with an annual inflation adjustment. To generate $50,000 per year at 4% requires a minimum portfolio size of $1,250,000. How close are you to your goal?

Turning to ABILITY, this relates to your ability to withstand the ups and downs of the market without getting nervous and making changes to your asset allocation. Selling in the face of a decline is about the worst thing you can do. Here is a table offered by author [[Larry Swedroe]],&lt;ref name="laura" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{forum link| p=221872| title=Asset Allocation/Swedroe chart| author=[[Larry Swedroe]]}}, viewed August 13, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; based on the 1970s bear market, showing the amount of decline for various stock/bond allocations:
{|
| style="vertical-align:top;" |
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center"
!Asset allocation %&lt;br&gt;(stock/bond)
!Exposure to&lt;br&gt;maximum loss
|-
||20/80||5%
|-
||30/70||10%
|-
||40/60||15%
|-
||50/50||20%
|-
||60/40||25%
|}
| style="vertical-align:top;" |
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center"
!Asset allocation %&lt;br&gt;(stock/bond)
!Exposure to&lt;br&gt;maximum loss
|-
||70/30||30%
|-
||80/20||35%
|-
||90/10||40%
|-
||100/0||50%
|}
|}

For example, you would be willing to accept a loss of 35% in your portfolio if you held an allocation of (80% stocks / 20% bonds). This table is from the 1970s; performance during other time periods will have different results. The general idea is to select an asset allocation you are comfortable with.

4. '''After designing an appropriate asset allocation for an investment portfolio, you need to execute a disciplined savings program''' (if you are accumulating wealth) for continually funding the investment plan, or a reasonable spending program (if you are drawing from the portfolio during retirement).&lt;ref group="note"&gt; This table from the Pfau paper provides guidance on savings rates for accumulating adequate retirement savings.

See [[Replacement rate models of retirement spending]] for more information about ''replacement rate''.&lt;/ref&gt; 

5. '''All of these investment decisions''' should be formalized in an Investment Policy Statement (IPS) or [[Investment Policy Statement#Investing plan | Investment plan]].

&lt;!-- ===Execute needed estate planning documents===

==Step 6: Monitor the plan &amp; make necessary adjustments==
Once a year, reevaluate your goals and compare to your time horizon. Adjust your insurance, estate matters, and [[Rebalancing | rebalance]] your portfolio.

Many parents are interested in teaching their children about personal finance.&lt;ref&gt;{{forum link| t=267082| title=Roth IRA for child}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://forum.mrmoneymustache.com/investor-alley/where-to-start-a-child%27s-roth-ira-with-very-low-income| title=Where to start a child's Roth IRA with very low income| publisher=MMM Forum| accessdate=August 31, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although parents can use ordinary savings accounts to teach their children about personal finance education, some account types could be useful to speed up retirement savings.

There are two distinct account types that parents could use: savings accounts, and [[Roth IRA]] accounts.&lt;ref name="irakids"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://irakids.com| title=IRA Kids| publisher=irakids.com| accessdate=August 31, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/business/success/kiplinger/tca-kids-can-get-a-jump-on-savings-with-a-roth-ira-20180410-story.html| title=Kids can get a jump on retirement savings with a Roth IRA| publisher=Chicago Tribune| accessdate=August 31, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Savings accounts themselves breakdown into Joint accounts and Custodial accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{forum link| t=162122| title=UGMA vs Kids Savings account}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
The choice of the account type depends on what the parent is trying to teach their child, the age at which they want the child to have access to the funds, the amount of savings, and the paperwork that the parent is willing to deal with.

===Children's savings account types===
{{See also|Uniform Gift to Minors Act}}

The table below summarizes the key differences between a Joint Savings Account and a Custodial Savings account:

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center"
|+Savings account differences'''
|-
!Feature !! Joint account !! Custodial account
|-
| Owner || Child and parent || Parent until the child is no longer minor
|-
| Change in ownership || Not applicable || Depending on the state, ownership changes when the child turns 18 or 21
|-
| Access to funds || Accessible to the child while still a minor || Not accessible to the child while still a minor
|}

Other features of the account, such as electronics fund transfer (EFT) access, minimum balance and monthly fees, depend on the provider.

===Custodial savings account vs custodial Roth IRA account===

Custodial Savings accounts and Custodial Roth IRA accounts differ in many of the same ways as non-custodial savings accounts differ from Roth accounts. However, there are some additional differences that a parent needs to know about before choosing one account over the other.

===Steps for custodial Roth IRA===
The steps to open a a custodial Roth IRA are:
# The parent opens a Custodial Roth IRA account with the parent as the custodian. Several financial institutions including Schwab, Fidelity and Vanguard offer Custodial Roth IRA accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.fidelity.com/retirement-ira/roth-ira-kids| title=Roth IRA for Kids| publisher=Fidelity| accessdate=August 31, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://thefinancebuff.com/best-broker-for-a-custodial-ira-for-your-kids.html| title=Best Broker for a custodial IRA for your kid| publisher=The Finance Buff| accessdate=August 31, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The parent (or the child, if able) records the source, date and amount of income. If the income is recorded on a W-2 or 1099, this step may not be necessary. On the other hand if income is not recorded formally on a W-2 or similar document, detailed records are necessary in case of a future audit or notice from the IRS.&lt;ref name="irakids" /&gt;
# The parent periodically transfers funds to the Custodial Roth IRA account, up to the Roth IRA limit or the child's taxable compensation, whichever is lower. The parent can transfer the money via check or EFT from their bank account to the Custodial Roth IRA if the financial institution allows it. Alternatively, the parent can open a Children's Savings Account and link that account to the Roth IRA account for periodic transfers. Several banks including Capital One, Ally and Bank of America allow parents to open a Children's Savings Account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.capitalone.com/bank/savings-accounts/kids-savings-account/| title=Kids Savings Account| publisher=Capital One| accessdate=August 31, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.ally.com/do-it-right/banking/open-a-child-savings-account-online/| title=Beyond the Piggy Bank| publisher=Ally| accessdate=August 31, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web| url=https://www.bankofamerica.com/deposits/savings/child-savings-accounts/| title=Child Savings Accounts| publisher=Bank of America| accessdate=August 31, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The parent files a tax return on behalf of the child if there is a separate filing requirement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://finance.zacks.com/interest-minors-bank-accounts-taxable-8610.html| title=Is Interest on a Minor's Bank Accounts Taxable?| publisher=Zacks| accessdate=August 31, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://ttlc.intuit.com/questions/3489679-my-child-has-interest-income-from-a-savings-account-how-do-i-report-that| title=My child has interest income from a savings account| publisher=Intuit| accessdate=August 31, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/when-does-your-child-have-file-tax-return.html| title=When does your child have to file a tax return| publisher=Nolo.com| accessdate=August 31, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are some sample tax returns at irakids.com.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://irakids.com/index.php?section=home&amp;content=paying_taxes| title=Paying Taxes on Earned Income| publisher=irakids.com| accessdate=August 31, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; See step #2 above.  

===Cautions===

Children's Savings accounts should not require a credit report pull from Chexystems, because the account is a Savings account rather than a checking account (or an account with a credit facility).&lt;ref&gt; Phone call with Capital One representative, January 2019.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, an active security freeze at Chexsystems should not affect opening the account. As always, it is best to check with the financial institution before opening an account.

Children can earn enough taxable income for IRA contributions by working for a business, working as a household employee, or through self-employment. Very young children have few options for legitimate work, but can earn taxable income modeling or acting.

Financial institutions that offer Custodial Roth IRA accounts do not police the sources of a child's income, so the child or the parent has to maintain enough documentation. Where this is a W-2 (employee) or 1099 (independent contractor), documentation is simpler. However, if the child earned money from jobs such as lawn mowing, baby sitting, ice cream stands, and so on, the parent and child need to create their own documentation for the income. Several people have reported successfully funding Custodial Roth IRAs and creating their own documentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://the-military-guide.com/start-a-roth-ira-for-your-kid/| title=Start a Roth IRA for your kid| publisher=The Military Guide| author=Doug Nordman| date=June 11, 2019| accessdate=August 31, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.marottaonmoney.com/how-to-fund-your-roth-with-babysitting-money/| title=How to Fund Your Roth with Babysitting Money| author=Megan Russell| date=February 14, 2020| accessdate=August 31, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Beware that a child who has self-employment income over $400 must pay self-employment taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-utl/OC-Whateverystudentshouldknowaboutsummerjobsandtaxes.pdf| title=What every student should know about summer jobs and taxes| publisher=IRS| accessdate=August 31, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-schedule-se-form-1040| title=About Schedule SE (Form 1040), Self-Employment Tax| publisher=IRS| accessdate=August 31, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, for several jobs that children may have, such as babysitting, house cleaning, or yard work, they would be classified as household employees, rather than self-employed. Household employers do not have to pay employment taxes if the employee makes less than $2,300 during the year, or if the employee is under 18 any time during the year. Furthermore, IRS Publication 926 states:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-publication-926| title=About Publication 926, Household Employer's Tax Guide| publisher=IRS| accessdate=August 31, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{blockquote|If you pay the employee less than $2,300 in cash wages in 2021, none of the wages you pay the employee are social security or Medicare wages and neither you nor your employee will owe social security or Medicare tax on those wages.}}
Presumably, this would also be true if the employee is under 18 at any time during the year.

Family businesses (which are a good way for children to earn taxable income, as well as for other tax benefits) and parents should not treat payment for household chores as taxable income, either as the basis of an IRA contribution or as a business tax deduction. Opinions are that income earned for household chores is not taxable income, and therefore ineligible for Custodial Roth IRAs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.kiplinger.com/article/saving/T046-C002-S001-roth-rules-for-kids.html| title=Roth Rules for Kids| publisher=Kiplinger| author=Janet Bodnar| date=December 20, 2006| accessdate=August 31, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.tomcopelandblog.com/blog/dont-count-chores-when-hiring-your-own-children| title=Don’t Count Chores When Hiring Your Own Children| author=Tom Copeland| date=June 10, 2013| accessdate=August 31, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://fairmark.com/retirement/roth-accounts/contributions-to-roth-accounts/roth-iras-for-minors/| title=Roth IRAs for Minors| publisher=Fairmark| author=Kaye A.

{{blockquote|Considering these factors and particularly the domestic character of many of the tasks performed, it is our view that these part-time services were in the main part of parental training and discipline rather than the services rendered by an employee for an employer.}}

To check that a financial institution offers Custodial Roth IRAs, and for any account minimums and other administrative details, it is best to call them directly. Online articles written months or years ago may no longer be accurate. For example, Custodial Roth IRAs at Vanguard had a minimum of $1,000 in 2012. However, as of 2019, there were no minimums for Custodial Roth IRAs at Vanguard, as these accounts are now brokerage accounts with $0 minimum, rather than mutual fund accounts that have a higher minimum.&lt;ref&gt; Phone call with Vanguard representative, January 2019.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fidelity Youth Account ==
Fidelity offers a non-custodial account for teens 13 to 17 years old. The teen is the account owner and will get a free debit card. There are no account fees or minimums (subject to restrictions listed on the Fidelity site).

Parents or guardians open this account, and are responsible for the account activity. Some relevant links:

A '''taxable account''' is one where the normal IRS tax rules apply. In a taxable account, you pay taxes on interest, dividends, and capital gains, in the year in which you earn them. Checking accounts, savings accounts, [[Money markets|money market]] accounts, and brokerage accounts are all taxable accounts.

Taxable accounts have none of the special tax rules that ''tax-advantaged'' accounts have. [[401(k)|401(k)s]], [[Traditional IRA|IRAs]], [[403(b)|403(b)s]], [[Health savings account|Health Savings Accounts]] (HSAs), and [[529 plan|529 plans]] are all tax-advantaged accounts. However, unlike tax-advantaged accounts, taxable accounts do not have restrictions on contributions or withdrawals.

==Taxable account basics==

The overall tax rules for taxable accounts are:
* You make taxable investments with after-tax money
* You pay tax on interest and dividends that your investments generate, and on any capital gains you realize, in the year in which they occur.
** The tax on these is at either your ordinary income tax rate (for interest, [[non-qualified dividends]], and short-term capital gains), or at a reduced rate for long-term capital gains and [[Qualified dividend|qualified dividends]].
* When you sell an investment, you pay tax on the difference between your sale price and your [[Cost basis methods|cost basis]] (effectively, what you paid for the investment).
** The tax on these is at either a short-term capital gains rate (if held for one year or less) or long-term capital gains rate (if held for longer than one year). 
* Taxable accounts have no contribution or income limitations, and no withdrawal restrictions.

Some cases where you might use a taxable account:
* Saving for when you need the money sooner than you could take it from your retirement accounts. Examples include [[Emergency fund|emergency funds]], and saving for a car, house down payment, or other large purchase.
* Saving for retirement when you want to save more than the contribution limits for tax-advantaged retirement accounts.
* Holding investments that are not available in your tax-advantaged accounts.

==Details==

You pay tax on earnings from a taxable account in the year in which you earn them. This section looks at the tax treatment of different kinds of earnings in a taxable account.

Regardless of the type of earnings, you treat all taxable account earnings as investment income. However, your tax on investment income is different from that for employment income in a few areas:
* You do not pay [[Payroll tax|payroll taxes]] (Social Security Tax, Medicare Tax, or the Additional Medicare Tax) on investment income.
* You may have to pay the [[ACA net investment income tax|Net Investment Income Tax]] on investment income.

===Interest===

You pay tax on interest, for example earned from a savings account or money market, as ordinary income in the year you receive it. Interest has no preferential tax treatment.

Payers usually report your interest payments on IRS [https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-1099-int Form 1099-INT].

===Bond interest and coupons===

You normally pay tax on [[Bond basics|bond]] interest (coupons) as interest, although some types of government-issued bonds pay interest that is exempt from certain taxes:
* Corporate bond interest is fully taxable.
* You pay full federal tax on federal government bond interest ([[United States Treasury security|Treasury notes]], I-Bonds, [[TIPS]], and so on), but this is typically exempt from state income tax.
* [[Municipal bonds|Municipal bond]] (issued by state and local governments) interest is typically exempt from both federal taxes, and state taxes in the state that issued the bonds; although exceptions exist, so you need to carefully check your state's tax rules.

===Dividends===

[[Dividend|Dividends]] are payments a business makes to its shareholders (owners). If you hold shares of stock in a taxable account, you will receive dividends when the stock pays out dividends.

You pay tax on dividends that meet the requirements for [[Qualified dividend | qualified dividends]] at long-term capital gains tax rates. These are lower than for ordinary income. Dividends that do not meet these requirements are called [[non-qualified dividends]], and you pay tax on them at ordinary income rates.

Payers report your dividends on IRS [https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-1099-div Form 1099-DIV].

===Capital gains and losses===

When you sell an investment for more than its ''[[Cost basis methods|cost basis]]'' (typically, what you paid for it, although sometimes the IRS requires you to adjust this), your profit on the investment is taxable income in the year the investment was sold.

Generally, if you held it for more than one year, you pay tax on the gain at reduced long-term capital gains tax rates. If you held it for one year or less, you pay tax on the gain as ordinary income. You only pay tax on the part of the sale price that is your gain. You do not pay tax on the part of your sale price that is your ''cost basis'' (typically the amount you originally invested).

When you sell an investment for less than its cost basis (that is, at a loss), your loss is generally tax-deductible. If you held the investment for more than a year, you first use the loss to offset long-term capital gains on your other investment sales, then offset short-term gains, and finally you can use up to $3,000 of remaining loss to offset earned income. You carry over losses above the $3,000 limit to future years, and you can use them then. This is called ''capital loss carryover.''

Typically, payers report your capital gains and losses on IRS [https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-1099-b Form 1099-B].

===Distributions===
{{Main|Capital gains distribution}}

If you hold a [[Mutual fund|mutual fund]] or [[Exchange-traded fund]] (ETF) in a taxable account, the fund pays you any interest, dividends, and capital gains earned inside it. You may see capital gains reported on a 1099 form at the end of the year, even if you did not sell any shares of the mutual fund or ETF.

===Step-up in basis===

The cost basis of investments "[[Step-up in basis|steps up]]" to equal the value of the security when inherited after the owner's death. For example, if your uncle owned shares of a stock worth $100,000 with a basis of $20,000 (what he originally paid for it, plus any reinvested dividends), and you inherit these when he dies, your basis becomes $100,000 on the day you inherit the stock. If you sell the stock immediately for $100,000, you receive the full value and pay no tax. If your uncle had sold the stock the day before he died, he would pay capital gains tax on the $80,000 gain.

It is possible to gift taxable investments while alive. In this case, the recipient "inherits" the same basis as you had for purposes of gains. So if you receive a gift of investments with unrealized capital gains, selling them will mean you have to pay capital gains tax. If you sell for a loss, your cost basis for tax is the lower of your basis or the fair market value at the time of the gift. (This rule stops you from giving property with a loss to a relative who would get a larger tax benefit from the loss than you would.)

===Foreign tax credit===
{{Main|Foreign tax credit}}

International investments sometimes have to pay taxes in foreign countries, and when they do, Form 1099-DIV will show you the amount. Although there are some limitations, to avoid double tax you can take either a credit or deduction for foreign taxes. A tax credit is usually the better choice.

==Taxable account investing strategy==

In Traditional and Roth retirement accounts, your results depend only on the return from the investments you hold in them. Investing in a taxable account is considerably more difficult. Complex tax rules, the [[SEC Yield|yield]] (returns that are paid out from the investment as opposed to retained as an increase in value), and tracking your cost basis all cause complications.

'''Tax efficiency''' means minimizing your taxes over your entire portfolio by optimizing around tax laws. This section describes various strategies that minimize taxes and maximize your returns in taxable accounts.

===Tax-efficient funds and fund placement===
{{Main|Tax-efficient fund placement}}

Prefer minimal yield on taxable investments, for a given level of return. Lower yield improves your investment performance in several ways:
* Taxes that you would pay on dividends and capital gains stay in the investment, and this helps with compound growth.
* Growth in the form of price appreciation, rather than as yield, gives you control over when to realize this gain. For example, you could sell appreciated investments in low-income years to reduce your tax. You pay taxes on yield in the year you earn it, even if your tax rate is high in that year.
* You pay taxes on investments you hold for longer than one year at lower long-term capital gains rates, but you pay tax on yield at higher ordinary income tax rates.

Passive stock funds, such as [[index fund |index funds]] have an inbuilt tax efficiency that gives them an enormous advantage over actively-managed stock funds inside a taxable account. By design, passive funds buy and hold a set of stocks, and trades within the fund are rare (for example, to track the index as the market capitalization of the constituent stocks fluctuates). This means that a passive fund generates far lower capital gains than an active fund, and that any capital gain tends to be long-term. If the stocks pay dividends, those dividends are unavoidably passed to the fund owners, but even then, dividends are far more likely to meet the holding period requirement for [[Qualified dividend|qualified dividends]] and receive preferential tax treatment. 

[[ETF|Exchange-traded funds]] are often more tax-efficient than mutual funds (see also: [[ETFs vs mutual funds]]), although passive funds are already more tax-efficient than active funds, so the difference is smaller. Vanguard is a special case; both their ETFs and mutual funds have the same tax efficiency.

Several investment companies, including Vanguard, offer [[Tax-managed fund comparison|tax-managed funds]] specifically for taxable accounts. They design these for maximum tax efficiency, although at the cost of slightly higher expenses. Compared to low-expense non-tax-managed passive funds, which are already very efficient, the difference is small. If you have a very high [[Marginal tax rate|marginal tax rate]], tax-managed funds can offer an advantage in after-tax performance. However if you are in a lower bracket, the lower expenses of the normal funds will probably outweigh the tax efficiency of tax-managed funds, making normal funds the better choice.

[[Bond basics|Bonds]] and bond mutual funds are inherently tax ''in''-efficient investments, because much of their return is interest, and you pay tax on this as ordinary income in the year in which you earn it. For best tax efficiency you might want to locate bonds inside tax-advantaged accounts. However, bonds tend to be lower-return assets in most portfolios, and by putting those assets inside tax-advantaged accounts, you reduce your future tax-advantaged space.

For more on where to hold bonds, see [[Tax-efficient fund placement]]. 

===Tax-free investments===

Some investments, such as [[municipal bonds]], are exempt from federal tax, or state tax, or both. For investments in a taxable account, your [[Marginal tax rate#After-tax value|after-tax return]] is what matters. If you have a high [[Marginal tax rate|marginal tax rate]], you could see a significant benefit to your after-tax returns if you choose tax-free investments.

However, tax-free investments tend to deliver lower returns, so if you are in a lower tax bracket, you may see higher after-tax returns with fully taxable investments such as [[Corporate bonds|corporate bonds]], despite the higher tax cost. Also, for this reason it is usually not a good idea to use tax-free investments in tax-deferred or tax-free accounts such as [[401(k)|401(k)s]] and [[Traditional IRA|IRAs]].

While you do not directly pay tax on returns from tax-free investments, they are taken into account when phasing in [[Taxation of Social Security benefits|taxation of Social Security benefits]], and so they can have substantial tax consequences.

===Tax loss harvesting===
{{Main|Tax loss harvesting}}

''Tax loss harvesting'' means selling investments that have lost value relative to their basis, specifically so that you reduce your taxes. There are three ways that selling investments at a loss can save you tax:
* When you deduct the loss now and receive a tax deduction from the IRS, you effectively get an interest-free loan from the government. You can invest the taxes you save saved to generate future returns. The ability to deduct up to $3,000 of losses annually from earned income adds to your tax saving.
* Long-term capital gains tax rates are lower than ordinary income tax rates, so that you effectively swap a higher tax rate for a lower one if your losses offset short-term gains or ordinary income, but you can realize these as long-term gains.
* If you later [[Donating appreciated securities|donate appreciated assets]] to charity, or [[Step-up in basis|leave them to heirs]], they avoid capital gains taxes entirely.

In most cases, harvesting losses improves long-term performance, so consider harvesting your losses as soon as they occur. In rare cases, it may not be a good idea to harvest losses, for example if you know that your future tax rates will be much higher than today, or if your losses would offset gains that you would otherwise not pay tax on anyway.

When you harvest losses you need to pay attention to the [[Wash sale|wash sale rule]]. This disallows a tax deduction for your losses if you buy a "substantially identical" security within 30 days of the sale.

Frustratingly, the IRS has never defined "substantially identical", but it ''may'' include different mutual funds that track the same index, and different share classes of the same mutual fund or ETF. It would ''not'' include funds that track different sets of stocks, for example the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund (VTSAX) and the Vanguard S&amp;P 500 Index Fund (VFIAX), even though these two funds might have very high market correlation.

===Tax gain harvesting===
{{Main|Tax gain harvesting}}

Generally, keeping your investment gains give you better long-term performance, because the tax that you would otherwise pay compounds in your account, and because you might later [[Donating appreciated securities|donate to charity]] or get a [[Step-up in basis|step-up in basis]] at death. [[Tax gain harvesting]] is a much less common strategy than tax loss harvesting.

However, harvesting gains can make sense in some cases, perhaps if you are confident that your tax rates will be higher in the future, and you know you will want to sell the investment. Harvesting gains at a rate of 0% is usually a good idea, as long as the additional taxable income does not cause you unwanted tax consequences. There is no [[Wash sale|wash sale rule]] for tax gain harvesting.

===Low-basis investments===

Investors commonly have to deal with investments with a low cost basis (large unrealized capital gains). A large unrealized capital gain in an investment creates a large disincentive to sell.

This commonly happens when someone learns more about the [[Bogleheads investment philosophy]] and decides they no longer want to hold individual stocks in their taxable account, but these stocks have large unrealized gains. For any low-basis investment, there are three ways to dispose of it:
* Liquidate it and pay the tax cost. You could spread the sale across multiple years if the capital gains tax on the lump-sum would push you into a higher [[Marginal tax rate|marginal tax rate]] than for smaller gains, for example by triggering the [[ACA net investment income tax|Net Investment Income Tax (NIIT)]].
* Continue to hold it, and plan to either sell it at a future time when the taxes may be lower, or leave it as part of your [[Estate planning|estate]].
* [[Donating appreciated securities|Donate it to a charity]], avoiding the tax cost for both you and the charity and allowing you to deduct the full value of the investment.

Your best strategy depends on several factors, such as your current and expected tax rates, your need for cash, plans for charitable giving, your age and health, performance and risk level of the investment in question, and how well or poorly the investment fits into your [[Investment policy statement|investing plan]]. See also: [[Paying a tax cost to switch funds]]

Low-basis investments makes [[rebalancing]] challenging. Trading in a taxable account creates added tax drag and lowers long-term performance, so avoid it when possible. One way to rebalance is to trade only in tax-advantaged accounts, such as [[401(k)|401(k)s]] and [[Traditional IRA|IRAs]], balancing these against your taxable account. You can trade without any tax consequences in both Traditional and Roth retirement account. This means that you can often rebalancing without selling low-basis investments using a combination of new investments and trading within tax-advantaged accounts.

To restructure larger investments, you need to compare the benefit of selling low-basis investments with the tax cost, using the various factors described above.

===Tax lots===
{{Main|Cost basis methods}}

Buying shares of a security at different times, and [[Reinvesting dividends in a taxable account|reinvesting dividends]], gives you different ''tax lots'' of shares, each with a different cost basis. You have a choice about how you handle multiple tax lots:
* First-in-first-out (FIFO) method: Oldest shares are always sold first.
* Specific identification of shares: The brokerage identifies each tax lot of shares with its own cost basis.
* Average cost method: The IRS allows you to use an average cost method, where each sale has the average cost basis of all tax lots. Once you start using the average cost method, you have use it for all future transactions of that security, until you have sold all of its shares.

There is no single best cost basis method. Specific identification of shares gives you the most control, but can mean you have to track a large number of tax lots, particularly if your provider automatically reinvests your dividends.

Depending on your goals, it may be worthwhile to sell older or lower-basis investments first, for the lower tax rates on long-term capital gains. Or, it may be best to sell more recently-purchased higher-basis shares, to minimize realized capital gains and preserve lower-basis shares. 

Some brokerages offer more complex cost basis methods that try to optimize around tax laws. These tools may streamline trading, but make sure you understand the procedure before you use them, to make sure you are using the methods that work best for your situation.

==Performance==

Because the tax rules for taxable accounts are more complex than for retirement accounts, so is calculating the performance. You can use following formulas if you want to calculate future taxable account values from rate of return and other parameters.

This analysis assumes that all [[Reinvesting dividends in a taxable account|dividends are reinvested]] and all taxes are paid from the dividends. While dividend reinvestment is not always desirable, it makes it possible to directly compare performance in taxable accounts to the performance of tax-advantaged accounts.

Evaluating the performance of investments that have dividends periodically removed from the value, or that have dividend taxes paid from external sources, is more difficult than the method shown below, and would require discounted cash flow analysis. 

The following table summarizes the formulas for the pre-tax value &lt;math&gt;V(t)&lt;/math&gt;, basis &lt;math&gt;B(t)&lt;/math&gt;, and after-tax value &lt;math&gt;V_{at}(t)&lt;/math&gt;, for periodic (for example, annual) or continuous compounding:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Periodic (for example, annual) compounding !! Continuous compounding
|-
| &lt;math&gt;V(t) = V(0) \cdot (1+r-y \cdot tr_{div})^t&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;V(t) = V(0) \cdot e^{(r-y \cdot tr_{div})t}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;B(t) = B(0) + \left ( \frac{V(0) \cdot y \cdot (1-tr_{div})}{r-y \cdot tr_{div}} \right ) \left ( (1+r-y \cdot tr_{div})^t-1 \right )&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;B(t) = B(0) + \left ( \frac{V(0) \cdot y \cdot (1-tr_{div})}{r-y \cdot tr_{div}} \right ) \left ( e^{(r-y \cdot tr_{div})t}-1 \right )&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;V_{at}(t) = V(t) - \left ( V(t) - B(t) \right ) \cdot tr_{cg}&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;V_{at}(t) = V(t) - \left ( V(t) - B(t) \right ) \cdot tr_{cg}&lt;/math&gt;
|}

These formulas are derived [[Tax analysis|here]]. When analyzing a periodic compounding investment, make sure the period on the rates of growth matches the compounding period. For example, a monthly compounding investment with an annual rate of return of 8% and a yield of 2% would have a periodic return of ~0.667% (8% / 12) and a periodic yield of ~0.167% (2% / 12). Time should also have the units of number of compounding periods, for example, number of months. 

====Example====

You invest $10,000 in a mutual fund in a taxable account and plan to sell it after 25 years. Your federal tax rates are 24% on ordinary income and 15% on qualified dividends on long-term capital gains. In addition, your state charges a 9.3% tax on all forms of income, and you do not itemize your state income taxes on your federal return. 

You plan to move to a tax-free state, and you will pay a 15% long-term capital gains tax rate when the investment is sold. The mutual fund has an expected return of 9% and a yield of 2%, compounding annually. The yield is comprised of 90% long-term capital gains (paid within the fund and passed to you) and qualified dividends, and 10% short-term capital gains and [[Non-qualified dividends|non-qualified dividends]]. 

What is your expected after-tax value when the mutual fund is sold? Your effective tax rates are:

&lt;math&gt;tr_{div} = (15%+9.3%) \cdot 90% + (24%+9.3%) \cdot 10% = 25.2%&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;tr_{cg} = 15%&lt;/math&gt;

Your future balance is:

&lt;math&gt;V(25) = $10,000 \cdot (1+9%-(2% \cdot 25.2%))^{25} = $76,796.81&lt;/math&gt;

Your future basis is:

&lt;math&gt;B(25) = $10,000 + \left ( \frac{$10,000 \cdot 2% \cdot (1-25.2%)}{9%-(2% \cdot 25.2%)} \right ) \left ( (1+9%-(2% \cdot 25.2%))^{25}-1 \right ) = $21,761.77&lt;/math&gt;

After the fund is sold, your after-tax value will be:

&lt;math&gt;V_{at}(25) = $76,796.81 - \left ( $76,796.81 - $21,761.77 \right ) \cdot 15% = $68,541.55&lt;/math&gt;

===Comparison to traditional and Roth accounts===

In almost all cases, your taxes will be lower for investments inside traditional and Roth retirement accounts (401(k)s, IRAs, and so on) than for taxable accounts. A Roth retirement account has the same performance as a taxable account, but with no dividend and capital gains tax, and so its performance will always be equal to or higher than a taxable account.

Under the same conditions as the above example, an investment in a Roth account would be worth $86,230.81 ($10,000 * (1 + 9%)^25), about 26% more than the same investment in a taxable account. A traditional retirement account is similar to a Roth, except that you pay taxes when you withdraw the funds rather than when you invest them as after-tax income.

For these reasons, almost everybody should contribute retirement savings to traditional and Roth retirement accounts first. Use taxable accounts for retirement savings only if you want to invest more than the contribution limits on retirement accounts. Also, consider less widely known retirement account options, such as catch-up contributions, the [[Backdoor Roth|Backdoor Roth IRA]], the [[Mega-backdoor Roth]], and the [[IRA#Other IRA terminology|Spousal IRA]], before saving retirement funds in a taxable account. 

If you do use a taxable account for retirement savings, for good long-term performance it is critical that you hold low-cost tax-efficient investments.

===Comparison to non-deductible IRAs and variable annuities===

[[Non-deductible traditional IRA|Non-deductible traditional IRAs]] and [[Variable annuity|variable annuities]] have a similar tax structure: you contribute after-tax money, tax is deferred on your investment growth, and you pay tax on the growth when you withdraw it, as ordinary income.

For tax efficient investments, taxable accounts tend to outperform these accounts. The future value of the same investment in the above example inside a non-deductible IRA or variable annuity would be $86,230.81 ($10,000 * (1 + 9%)^25) before taxes, and '''$67,935.41''' ($86,230.81 - ($86,230.81 - $10,000) * 24%) after taxes.

For tax ''in''-efficient investments, non-deductible IRAs and variable annuities may have a significant advantage over a taxable account. 

Consider the above example, but with an investment that returns 6% that is all fully taxable yield. The future taxable balance is:

&lt;math&gt;V(25) = $10,000 \cdot (1+6%-(6% \cdot 25.2%))^{25} = $29,968.18&lt;/math&gt;

The future taxable basis will be:

&lt;math&gt;B(25) = $10,000 + \left ( \frac{$10,000 \cdot 6% \cdot (1-25.2%)}{6%-(6% \cdot 25.2%)} \right ) \left ( (1+6%-(6% \cdot 25.2%))^{25}-1 \right ) = $29,968.18&lt;/math&gt;

This makes sense. Because the growth is entirely due to yield, the future value and future basis are equal. This also means there is no capital gains tax to pay, so the future value is after-tax. The future value of a non-deductible IRA or variable annuity is:

&lt;math&gt;$10,000 \cdot (1+6%)^{25} = $42,918.71&lt;/math&gt;

After taxes, the value will be:

&lt;math&gt;V_{at}(25) = $42,918.71 - \left ( $42,918.71 - $10,000 \right ) \cdot 24% = $35,018.22&lt;/math&gt;

However, if you hold variable annuities, you need to compare the fees and liquidity issues against the tax advantages. Variable annuities typically have fees of 0.5-1%+ per year, and when subtracting these fees from the returns, the annuity performance is not nearly as good.

In the above example, the annuity would slightly outperform the taxable account with a fee of 0.5%, but under-perform with a fee of 1%. Annuities also typically have surrender fees for early withdrawal, and the IRS also applies an early withdrawal penalty for withdrawals before age 59.5.

Non-deductible traditional IRAs also have early withdrawal penalties and contribution limits, although low-fee IRAs are much easier to find. However, almost everybody should have access to a Roth IRA (which is strictly better than a non-deductible traditional IRA) due to the [[Backdoor Roth|Backdoor Roth IRA]]. For rare cases where a non-deductible traditional IRA make sense, see [[Non-deductible_traditional_IRA#Appropriate_uses|Appropriate uses]].

{{for|additional information|wikipedia:Insurance}}

'''Insurance''' is a form of risk management, usually via a contractual arrangement (an ''insurance policy'') under which one party pays another, the insurer, to take on a risk and make specified payments if that risk manifests during the term of the contract. There may be other parties to the arrangement, such as a beneficiary who receives the payments, different from the insured party.

==Reinsurance==
Insurers may pass on some part of the risk to another insurance company, known as a reinsurer.

For example, [[Life Insurance | life insurance]] primarily manages the risk of a person's death. If an employer purchases life insurance for its employees, as an employee benefit, then the employer owns the contract, each employee would be an insured person, and each can specify their beneficiary, while the insurance company is the fourth party.

That insurance company might also enter into a reinsurance policy to protect it from the risk of a single event killing many covered employees. In the reinsurance contract, the original insurer would own the contract, be the insured party, and be the beneficiary, while the second insurance company would be the insurer.

==When to insure==
In general, use insurance when you want to avoid a real risk of loss, and you can pay for insurance but you cannot "self insure" (that is, you cannot cover the loss yourself).

===Risks to insure===
While you can insure against almost any risk through specialty insurers, broadly speaking there are two main types of risk to insure against. The first is risk of harms directly to you or your family, and the second is the risk of liability for harming someone else, and so having to pay them for the harm done.

Also, see [[#Types of insurance|Types of insurance]] below.

====Risks of harms to yourself and family====
There are three main types of risk to you and your family: damage to property, loss of income, and unexpected expenses.
 
* Generally, risk of loss to your own property is the easiest type of risk to self insure, as amounts are limited to either the value of the property or the cost of replacing it. It may also be quite possible to self insure for a small loss (for example, a broken window) but need coverage for a large loss (for example, your house burns to the ground), so these insurance policies usually have [[#deductibles|deductibles]]. You may be able to self insure small amounts simply by planning on lowering other expenses to cover the loss.
* Risk of loss of income changes with your current income, your family status, and your savings and net worth. This is harder to self insure, because if the risk manifests, then you not only lose income, but your expenses may also rise at the same time. In general, as your annual income rises this risk rises, and as you get closer to retirement this risk lowers. For Americans overall, both tend to happen at the same time. The risk to your family from losing your income also varies depending on your family situation. Finally, as your savings and net worth rise, they generate more income, and this reduces the risk of losing your employment income.
* Risk of unexpected expenses is the risk of having to spend money that might not be available and was not planned for. Medical expenses are an obvious example, but if a spouse dies or becomes disabled then you might face unexpected childcare or other expenses.

====Risks of harming others====
Your risk of incurring liability to others by harming them varies based on your activities and profession. For examples, a car driver has higher risks than someone who only uses public transport, and a self-employed professional has higher risks than an assembly line worker. The potential loss varies with your net worth and income; the more you own and earn, the more that you might lose or need to pay in the future.

===Self insuring===
An insurance company makes its money from two main sources.

The first is the difference between the premiums paid for insurance policies and the amounts it pays out under the contracts, also known as the profit from underwriting. Because the payouts come after the premiums are paid, sometimes years later, it also has use of the money in the interim.

The money that the insurance company holds is its [[Insurance float | float]], and the company will invest it. The return on this investment is the second main source of income. The company uses this income to pay its administrative expenses and to generate profits for its owners.

Because of these administrative and profit overheads, it can be better to self-insure than to purchase an insurance policy. By self-insuring, you get to keep the investment returns on the floated amounts, the profit that the insurance company will make, and the administrative costs of the insurance company. To do this, you need to have enough saved money to cover the potential loss from the risk, and the discipline to keep that money saved in case the risk materializes.

Both are easier to manage for small amounts than large amounts. For example, with [[auto insurance]] it is usually easier to self-insure for the risk of damage to your own vehicle (no more than the cost of a new car) than for the risk of causing damage to other people and having to pay their medical expenses (an amount that could be extremely high).

====Deductibles====
Deductibles are insurance contract terms that let the insured party self-insure for small amounts of loss while having insurance protection against large losses. Because deductibles place the first dollars of loss on the insured party, they have a relatively large effect on the insurance policy premium. This makes them a useful insurance cost saving.

For a disciplined saver, the amount that they can self-insure will rise over time. Review existing policy deductibles periodically, to see if it would make sense to increase the deductible and lower the future premiums.

===Periodic review===
Where you have insurance, review existing coverage both periodically and on a major life event. Changes in your family, major changes in employment or compensation, and purchases and sales of insured property are all things that should trigger a review of insurance.

==Types of insurance==
As discussed above, there are different types of risk. Some types of insurance are for one risk only, while others combine coverage of different types of risk based on the source of the risk. Below are some common types of insurance coverage.

===Auto insurance===
[[Auto insurance]] usually covers both risks of property damage and needed medical care as a result of an incident involving a car. In most places, local laws require some minimum level of coverage to drive a car. Deductibles are usually available, and amounts and types of coverage are often highly customizable beyond the legally required minimum.

===Deposit insurance===
[[Deposit insurance]] covers the risk of losing money due to the failure of a financial institution. Government agencies usually provide it to all holders of certain types of account, up to pre-specified limits. Individual investors do not purchase it directly. Instead, the government agency charges the financial institutions directly for insurance cost, and these companies include this in the cost of their products.

===Directors and Officers (D&amp;O) insurance===
[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/directors-and-officers-liability-insurance.asp Directors and Officers (D&amp;O) insurance] covers any liabilities that come from serving on a board of directors for an HOA, company, non-profit, and so on.

===Health insurance===
[[:Category:Health insurance|Health insurance]] comes in many kinds, including [[dental insurance]]. In the U.S., most people with health insurance have either group insurance through an employer or family member's employer or government insurance, although individually purchased health insurance plans are also available.

In other countries, the government may or may not provide basic health insurance for all residents, and supplemental privately purchased insurance may or may not be either legal or readily available.

Generally speaking, health insurance covers only the cost of providing medical care to specific covered individuals. It may have deductibles.

===Homeowner's, renters', and landlords' insurance===
[[Homeowner's insurance]], [[renters' insurance]], and [[landlords' insurance]] cover you for loss of your own property, and for liability to others incurred because of their presence on your property. Deductibles are usually available. While a homeowner is paying off a mortgage on their house the lender will usually require homeowner's insurance, as may a buyer during the process of selling the house.

There are always excluded perils, which means that if the loss is caused by one of those items then the insurance provides no coverage. There may be ways to cover these exclusions, either by riders amending the standard policy for an additional fee or by purchasing specialty insurance such as [[earthquake insurance|earthquake]] or [[flood insurance]].

===Life insurance===
[[Life Insurance | Life insurance]] provides money for the beneficiary on the death of the insured person. It ensures the well-being of family members in the event of untimely death, and provides liquidity or bequests as part of an estate plan. Deductibles are usually not available. The most common forms are term insurance that is in force for only a period of time and the more expensive whole life insurance that combines the features of life insurance with those of a sub-par investment vehicle.

Rather than purchasing life insurance, you may be better off purchasing term insurance and using a good investment vehicle, but life insurance does have a place in certain estate planning situations. An employer may offer [[accidental death and dismemberment insurance]] as a supplemental employee benefit. This pays additional amounts above life insurance if you die or suffer serious injury.

===Private mortgage insurance and credit insurance===
[[Private mortgage insurance]] and [[credit insurance]] are rarely of value to the purchaser, but which a lender may be require. They protect the lender from potential losses but the borrower pays the premiums. As a rule you should avoid these whenever possible. If you are required to have them, remove them at the earliest possible date.

===Professional insurance===
[[Professional insurance]] has many names, depending on the profession. For example, 'malpractice insurance' and 'errors and omissions insurance'. It protects the professional from paying directly for losses caused to their clients, and potentially others, by their work.

===Title insurance===
[[Title insurance]] protects against the loss of property, usually land and buildings, because of flaws in the chain of prior ownership. You would usually take it out when you buy or mortgage a property. It has two forms, one that protects the lender on a mortgaged property, and one that protects the purchaser of a property. Lenders often require the form that protects them. The one that protects the purchaser may also be available at that time at no or limited additional cost.

===Umbrella insurance===
[[Umbrella insurance]] provides additional [[Liability Insurance | liability insurance]] above and beyond that contained in your other insurance policies. If you use it, you will normally need to coordinate umbrella insurance with the liability limits under your other policies.

===Workers' compensation and disability insurance===
[[Workers' compensation insurance]] and [[:Category:Disability insurance|disability insurance]] collectively provide cover for loss of ability to work and earn income because of accident, injury, or illness.

Disability insurance usually covers losing this ability because of something happening outside the workplace, and your employer may offer it, or you can purchase it individually. An employer must usually provide workers comp insurance; this covers both losses caused by the conditions of work and the medical care costs of a workplace incident.

==Insurance company ratings==
In a similar manner as bond credit ratings are determined by Moody's (for example), A.M. Best rates insurance companies.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Moody's Investors Service, Fitch, and Standard &amp; Poor's Ratings Services are three of several credit rating agencies the SEC categorizes as a [https://www.sec.gov/answers/nrsro.htm Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (NRSRO)]. The SEC's Office of Credit Ratings maintains a list here: [https://www.sec.gov/page/ocr-section-landing Office of Credit Ratings]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;On March 29, 2011, AM Best furnished to the Commission on Form NRSRO a notice of withdrawal from registration in the category of financial institutions.

==CLUE database==
C.L.U.E. (Comprehensive Loss Underwriting Exchange) is a claims history database created by ChoicePoint that lets insurance companies access consumer claims information when they are underwriting or rating an insurance policy.&lt;ref name="OCI"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://oci.wi.gov/pub_list/pi-207.htm| title=Frequently Asked Questions About C.L.U.E.| publisher=Wisconsin Office of the Commissioner of Insurance| accessdate=June 6, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The report contains consumer claim information provided by insurance companies. It includes policy information such as name, date of birth, and policy number, claim information such as date of loss, type of loss and amounts paid, and a description of the property covered. For homeowner's coverage, the report includes the property address, and for auto coverage, it includes specific vehicle information.&lt;ref name="OCI"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The database contains up to seven years of personal property claims history.&lt;ref name="OCI"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Free annual report===
The [[wikipedia:Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act|Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act]] (FACT Act) was enacted in 2003. It amends the [[wikipedia:Fair Credit Reporting Act|Fair Credit Reporting Act]] (FCRA), a federal law that regulates, in part, who is permitted to access your consumer report information and how it can be used. The FACT Act entitles consumers to one free copy of their consumer file from certain consumer reporting agencies every twelve months.&lt;ref name="LexNex"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.lexisnexis.com/risk/factact/| title=FACT Act| publisher=LexisNexis| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180602051742/https://personalreports.lexisnexis.com/fact_act_disclosure.jsp| archive-date=June 2, 2018| accessdate=June 6, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''{{PAGENAME}}''', also known as a 702(j) plan, is simply a rebranding of a [[life insurance]] contract. The name comes from Section 7702 of the IRS code,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/7702| title=26 U.S. Code § 7702 - Life insurance contract defined| publisher=Legal Information Institute| accessdate=September 12, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt; which regulates life insurance contracts. The goal is usually to 'overfund' the life insurance, to the point where the policy value can later be borrowed from to fund retirement costs.

{{Warning|
7702 plans, also known as 702(j) plans, are life insurance products marketed as retirement plans. These plans are '''strongly not recommended''' for most investors. ''Please ask in the forum for advice.''}}

A 7702 can be seen as equivalent to an [[IRA]], [[Roth IRA]] or [[401(k)]] plan, but invested in life insurance products.

== Is a 7702 right for me? ==

'Overfunded' life insurance has long been a popular strategy among the ultra wealthy, as it allows sheltering far more income from taxes than otherwise allowed by law. For the majority however, the picture is far more murky. With a 7702 plan you must forgo current tax breaks, and any offered employer contribution to your retirement. The plans are almost impossible to compare, and are quite complex. You have to make a lot of assumptions to predict the performance of these plans, including speculating about future tax rates. Many of the rates in the plan are subject to unilateral change by the insurance company.

A typical Bogleheads' view of a 7702 is that it is yet another high cost investment option with unproven benefits.

== Investments that never go down ==
{{See also|Equity-indexed annuity}}
A typical sales pitch for a 7702 plan includes investment that can go up, but never go down. Rarely mentioned are the details of how this is done. Such an indexing scheme typically works something like this:

* Take the price (but usually not the dividends) of a major index like the Dow Jones Industrials.
* In years when the price goes down, $0 is credited to the cash value of the life insurance.
* In years when the price goes up, most of the increase is credited to the cash value. But the amount is capped, typically at 10%.

Thus for a sizeable cut of the potential gains, the insurance company will smooth out the bumps of the stock market for you. Over shorter periods of time, the insurance company may lose out significantly. Over long periods of time, the insurance company makes a large profit. A typical contract allows the insurance company to adjust the cap and participation rate at any time (even if that reduces your gains).

== Money when you need it ==

A typical insurance contract allows you to borrow from the cash value of the account. In a 7702 scheme, the plan includes borrowing. Just be aware there is an unknowable interest cost involved – insurance company interest rates (which they can change at any time). In comparison, with an IRA you can take your own contributions back out with no fees whatsoever, and you have access to money for education expenses and home buying, in addition to unrestricted access at retirement age.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' often called DI or disability income insurance, is a form of insurance that insures the beneficiary's earned income against the risk that disability will make working (and therefore earning) impossible.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability_insurance Disability insurance], from Wikipedia&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description and appropriate use==

Disability insurance insures against your loss of income because of an inability to work due to disability. If you become disabled, the policy pays you a monthly income. It is usually appropriate in the same situations as [[life insurance]] (insuring a working spouse's income, or the value of their unpaid work), and others too. If a single person with no dependents becomes disabled, they will need income to pay for normal living expenses, and possibly other expenses, such as home health aid. If the combination of their assets plus any government assistance (for example, state and Social Security disability payments) would not be sufficient to maintain an acceptable standard of living, a disability policy would be needed to make up the difference. 

Insurers typically only offer disability insurance up to about 60% of your current income, because they do not want the incentive for you to not work to be too large. If you need disability insurance, it is usually wise to purchase as much as you can. If you become disabled, the monthly payments need to cover all your expenses, and '''also savings for retirement''', because most disability policies stop paying around age 65. As this income is not earned, it must be saved and invested in a [[taxable account]]. You may be eligible to receive [[Social Security]] retirement benefits starting around age 65, but the benefit depends on your earning history. If you get disabled at a young age, your Social Security-eligible earnings may be very limited, and you would able receive a small benefit. You could create a written plan to determine more accurately how much coverage you need.

Disability insurance is much more expensive than term life insurance. The chances of dying young are low, but the chances of becoming disabled for a significant length of time during your career are quite high - 10-30% by one estimate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/06/your-money/life-and-disability-insurance/06money.html | title=The Odds of a Disability Are Themselves Odd| publisher=New York Times| accessdate=Feb 23, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disability policies are also more complex than term life policies by necessity; the definition of disabled is much more nuanced than the definition of dead. Disability policies vary in how they [[#Disability definitions|define disability]] (physical, cognitive, behavioral, substance abuse, how they handle partial disability, and so on) and on whether they consider you disabled if you cannot work at the job you had when you became disabled, versus whether you can work ''any job''. They also have an ''elimination period'' you have to wait before being able to file a claim, analogous to a deductible. A good independent insurance agent (that is, one who is not "captive" to a particular insurer and can only sell their policies) can work with you to find a policy suited for your particular needs.

==Disability definitions==

Disability insurance is all about the definition of disability. Only a few people have a truly comprehensive disability policy through their employer. This is because the definition of disability for group policies usually requires that, when making a disability claim, you cannot work in your job "or any other job" (or something to that effect). As as a result, you usually must be completely and totally disabled on a permanent basis to collect long term disability from your employer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=992001#p992001 Disability Insurance -- for a "thinking" job], forum discussion, direct link to post.&lt;/ref&gt;

A good individual disability policy will have what is called an ''own-occupation'' definition. That definition says that if you cannot work in your job, even if you can work in another job, they will still pay 100% of the benefits.

*''True own occupation:'' You are disabled if you cannot do your occupation.
*''Modified own occupation:'' The insurance company cannot make you do another occupation. If you do, you would no longer be totally disabled and would collect under partial disability.
*''Any occupation:'' You are unable to perform the material duties of any occupation for which you are trained or can be trained to perform.

===Social Security definitions===
The Social Security Administration provides disability benefits, but implements a very strict definition:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ssa.gov/planners/disability/dqualify4.html What We Mean By Disability], from the Social Security Administration.&lt;/ref&gt;

*No benefits are payable for partial disability or for short-term disability.

"Disability" under Social Security is based on your inability to work. You are disabled under Social Security rules if:

*You cannot do work that you did before;
*(Social Security Administration) decides that you cannot adjust to other work because of your medical condition(s); and
*Your disability has lasted or is expected to last for at least one year or to result in death.

Group disability policies may integrate with Social Security disability insurance; meaning that a policy holder's benefits will be reduced by the Social Security benefit.

==Well-written policy==
A well-written policy should contain the following.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=995832#p995832 Disability Insurance -- for a "thinking" job], forum discussion, direct link to post.&lt;/ref&gt; Refer to [http://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=995832#995832 this forum thread post] for further discussion regarding the differences between individual and group policies as described here.
{{Notice|
Everyone's situation is different so there will be some minor exceptions.
}}
===Must have===
#''Guaranteed Renewable/Non-cancellable:'' You cannot be dropped, rates cannot be raised, and coverage cannot be changed.&lt;ref&gt;Definitions from the [http://www.iii.org/about/ Insurance Information Institute], [http://www.iii.org/articles/what-are-the-types-of-disability-insurance.html What are the types of disability insurance?]:
*''Noncancellable:'' The policy cannot be canceled by the insurance company, except for nonpayment of premiums. This gives you the right to renew the policy every year without an increase in the premium or a reduction in benefits.
*''Guaranteed renewable'' gives you the right to renew the policy with the same benefits and not have the policy canceled by the company. However, your insurer has the right to increase your premiums as long as it does so for all other policyholders in the same rating class as you.&lt;/ref&gt;
#''Coverage for your own occupation for the entire time:'' This can be ''true own-occupation'' or ''modified own-occupation''. When combined with ''Guaranteed Renewable/Non-cancellable'' this means that when a CPA quits his job to become a ''ditch digger'', "ditch digger" is his new occupation. The insurance company must maintain the same benefit at the same price regardless that it does not insure ditch diggers and that his income is well below his former occupation.
#Coverage until age 65
#Coverage for both total and partial disability without having to be totally disabled first
#''Cost of living adjustment (COLA):'' A benefit that increases with inflation (usually a flat percentage as opposed to the [[:Consumer price index | Consumer Price Index]] (CPI))
#Coverage past the age of 65 or money that goes into a trust for retirement
#A big enough benefit to allow you to maintain your standard of living that you would like if you do collect.
#''Recovery Benefits to age 65:'' A must have for anyone who is self employed or will be in the future.

===Nice to have===

#True ''own-occupation'' coverage
#No limitations on mental/nervous disorders
#No integration with government programs

==Group versus individual policy considerations==

The policy holder should be aware of differences between group and individual policies. Some limitations of group policies:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=992034#p992034 Disability Insurance -- for a "thinking" job], direct link to post.&lt;/ref&gt;

#If the policy is given to the employee without grossing up their income, the benefit is taxable.
#The benefit does not increase with inflation.
#The benefit is integrated with Social Security disability insurance and [[:#Work-related injury (workmen's compensation) | Workmen's Compensation]].
#It does not pay for partial disability.
#It pays for partial disability, but you must be totally disabled first.
#It has an "any occupation" definition of disability or if it has an "own occupation" definition, the definition is temporary.
#It may offer certain "own occupation" coverage for a period of time, but after that time period, it may eliminate benefits if you can be employed in "gainful employment" in a different profession at any salary or at a percentage of your insured earnings.
#It is not enough coverage.
#It does not cover retirement plan contributions.
#It is covered by [http://webapps.dol.gov/elaws/elg/erisa.htm ERISA] (Employee Retirement Income Security Act). This makes it much easier to deny legitimate claims. It is not coincidental that the vast majority of claims are with group policies.
#The entire group can be dropped.

Another consideration is for plans that are self-insured (Company Insured) versus those where premiums are paid to an insurance company. In a ''Company Insured'' disability plan, the ''Company'' owns the policy and sets up payments with a payment agency. But if the Company goes out of business, or is acquired by another company, there is no federal regulation or requirement that the policy continue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=994304#p994304 Disability Insurance -- for a "thinking" job], forum discussion, direct link to post.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Short-term versus long-term disability==

Short-disability is intended to cover a temporary inability to work; up to 6 months of coverage may be offered. Long-term disability covers from that temporary period of time up-to and including permanent disability. The typical 6 month long-term disability waiting period reflects this intent.

Employers may offer both short-term and long-term disability insurance policies. If a short-term policy is not offered, consider costs of a private short-term disability policy versus withdrawals from an [[:Emergency fund| emergency fund]].

==State-mandated disability insurance==

Five states and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico require employers to provide Temporary Disability Insurance (TDI) programs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dlt.state.ri.us/tdi/Faq4qhp.htm Temporary Disability Insurance Frequently Asked Questions], from the RI Department of Labor and Training&lt;/ref&gt; ''Off-the-job'' injuries or illness apply here.

==Work-related injury (workmen's compensation)==

Disability insurance benefits are generally a matter of agreement between an employer and an employee (or the employee's representative).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dol.gov/dol/topic/benefits-other/disabilityins.htm Disability Insurance], from the [http://www.dol.gov/ U.S Department of Labor]&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals injured on the job while employed by private companies or state and local government agencies should contact their state [http://www.dol.gov/owcp/dfec/regs/compliance/wc.htm workers' compensation board].

The Federal Employees' Compensation Act (FECA), administered by the [http://www.dol.gov/owcp/ Office of Workers' Compensation Programs (OWCP)], provides compensation benefits to federal employees for temporary disability due to employment-related injury or disease.

Group disability policies may integrate with workmen's compensation; meaning that a policy holder's benefits will be reduced by the amount of compensation.

==Examples==
With a good contract, it is all about your ability to do your occupation at the time of disability.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=956031#p956031 Disability Insurance -- for a "thinking" job], forum discussion, direct link to post.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Notional example 1===
The following is a notional example to demonstrate the concept:

:Jim is a CPA making $110,000/year. He has an individual policy with an own occupation definition of disability. His benefit is $5,000/month.

:He goes to the doctor for his annual physical. The doctor informs him that he has AIDS, Cancer, hepatitis, alzheimers, parkinsons and a cold. He is not disabled because he can still do his job.

:One day after work, he goes into a bar and buys a drink for the homeless man next to him. The "homeless" man turns out to be Jesus. To thank him for his kindness, Jesus cures him of all his illnesses. Jim rethinks his life and quits his job as a CPA and decides to become a grave digger for $12/hour.

:In Jim's weekly basketball game, he fractures his hand and can no longer grip a shovel. He is totally disabled and instead of getting paid a taxable $12/hour, he will collect a tax free $5,000/month.

''Explanation:'' Purchasing disability coverage is all about what you are doing when they purchase the policy. A good policy will be guaranteed renewable and non-cancellable. This means that the insurance company cannot raise the rates and cannot change any of the terms. Collecting on a policy is all based upon what you are doing at the time of disability.

So, although a company will not issue a policy on a $12/hr ditch digger, they are stuck insuring one when someone with prior coverage chooses to become one. Because benefits are a dollar amount and not a percentage, the insured can financially benefit from becoming disabled.

===Notional example 2===
A surgeon incurs permanent nerve damage in his hands. He cannot perform surgery now, but can still teach at a medical school. With an ''own-occupation'' definition, he could collect the disability benefit while still earning six figures teaching at medical school on top of that.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=992001#p992001 Disability Insurance -- for a "thinking" job], forum discussion, direct link to post.&lt;/ref&gt;

If the definition was like a group plan and said he was not able to work in any job, they would not pay a claim since he could still teach.

Taking that a step further, even if he could not teach, but could hand out stickers to shoppers at Wal-Mart, they still may not pay a claim since he can still "work" even though he would earn $7/hour instead of $500k/year.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' (LTC or LTCI), is an insurance product sold in the United States, United Kingdom and Canada that helps provide for the cost of long-term care beyond a predetermined period. Long-term care insurance covers care generally not covered by health insurance, Medicare, or Medicaid.

==Overview==
Long-term care is a type of personal care you may need if you are unable to care for yourself because of a physical illness, a disability, or a cognitive impairment, such as Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;ref name="Tex"&gt;[http://www.tdi.texas.gov/pubs/consumer/cb032.html A Shopper’s Guide to Long-Term Care Insurance], from [http://www.tdi.texas.gov/index.html Texas Department of Insurance]&lt;/ref&gt;

Long-term care is different from traditional medical care that tries to treat or cure illnesses. Long-term care helps you keep your current lifestyle, but it may not improve or fix your medical problems. You can receive care at home or in a hospice, adult day care center, nursing home, or assisted living facility.&lt;ref name="Tex" /&gt;

If you have an illness or disability, you may need assistance with your normal daily activities, such as eating or getting around. If you are cognitively impaired, you may need supervision, protection, or reminders to take medicines or perform other activities. Long-term care may also include services to evaluate your overall needs.&lt;ref name="Tex" /&gt;

==Paying for long-term care==
In-home or nursing home care required by an elderly or disabled individual can be very expensive. Most types of insurance do not provide coverage for such care, the main exception being Medicaid, which provides coverage for qualified low-income individuals. Under Medicaid, individuals have a restricted choice of providers.

Long-term care can be funded in a variety of ways, including:

:*Long-term care insurance policy
:*Self-insure
:*[[Medicare]]&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Medicare’s skilled nursing facility (SNF) benefit does not cover most nursing home care. Medicare will pay the cost of some skilled care in an approved nursing home or in your home, but only in specific situations. Do not depend on Medicare to pay for long-term care. ([http://www.newyorklife.com/newyorklife.com/General/FileLink/Static%20Files/NYL2/pdf/LTC_Shopper_Guide.pdf A Shopper’s Guide to Long-Term Care Insurance], from NAIC, page 4.)&lt;/ref&gt;
:*Medicare Supplement Insurance&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Private insurance that helps pay for some of the gaps in Medicare coverage, such as hospital deductibles and excess physician charges above what Medicare approves. Medicare supplement policies do not cover long-term care costs. However, four Medicare supplement policies—Plans D, G, I and J— do pay up to $1,600 per year for services to people recovering at home from an illness, injury or surgery. The benefit will pay for short-term, at-home help with activities of daily living. You must qualify for Medicare-covered home health services before this Medicare supplement benefit is available. ([http://www.newyorklife.com/newyorklife.com/General/FileLink/Static%20Files/NYL2/pdf/LTC_Shopper_Guide.pdf A Shopper’s Guide to Long-Term Care Insurance], from NAIC, page 4.)&lt;/ref&gt;
:*Medicaid&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Medicaid pays most long-term care expenses for eligible individuals with low incomes. Medicaid is a state and federal assistance program. To qualify for Medicaid, you must meet state and federal guidelines for income and assets. Many people pay for long-term care with their own money until they become eligible for Medicaid. ([http://www.tdi.texas.gov/pubs/consumer/cb032.html A Shopper’s Guide to Long-Term Care Insurance], from [http://www.tdi.texas.gov/index.html Texas Department of Insurance])&lt;/ref&gt;

Long-term care insurance (LTCI) fills the gap in most health insurance policies, providing coverage for long-term care without requiring the individual to impoverish him/herself as is required for Medicaid coverage. 

LTCI premiums depend on the level of benefits:&lt;ref name="Dalton"&gt;M Dalton, J Dalton, "Personal Financial Planning: Theory and Practice," Dalton Publishing, St. Rose, Louisiana, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

:*skilled nursing care--the highest level of physician directed care provided in traditional nursing homes, 
:*intermediate nursing care--similar to skilled nursing care but provided occasionally instead of daily, 
:*custodial care--assistance with daily tasks, not necessarily ordered by a physician, 
:*home health care--care provided part-time in the home, and 
:*adult day care--similar to child day care but for adults. 

LTCI policies may include other features similar to health insurance policies such as waiver of premium during benefit periods, elimination periods, and limits on duration of benefits.&lt;ref name="Dalton" /&gt;

Below are some points to observe when investigating policies:&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The NAIC's [http://www.newyorklife.com/newyorklife.com/General/FileLink/Static%20Files/NYL2/pdf/LTC_Shopper_Guide.pdf A Shopper’s Guide to Long-Term Care Insurance], pages 33 to 36, contains a comprehensive list; including a list of insurer rating agencies.&lt;/ref&gt;
:*Check out the companies’ rate increase histories
:*Don’t buy more coverage than you need
:*Don’t be misled by advertising: Medicare does not endorse or sell long-term care insurance policies. Be wary of any advertising that suggests Medicare is involved.
:*Be sure you look at your policy during the free-look period: You generally have up to 30 days to decide on keeping or canceling the policy.
:*Check on the financial stability of the company you’re thinking about buying from

==Is long-term care insurance appropriate?==
Long-term care insurance can help protect your assets against the high cost of extended long-term care. However, long-term care insurance usually only makes sense if you have significant assets to protect other than your home, car, and a small amount of cash.&lt;ref name="Tex" /&gt;

Long-term care insurance is probably not a good idea if you have trouble stretching your income to pay for utilities, food, or medicine. If you don’t have significant assets, you may have to pay for your care out of pocket until you exhaust, or spend down, your assets enough to qualify for Medicaid.&lt;ref name="Tex" /&gt;

To determine whether long-term care insurance is right for you, consider your personal risk factors (life expectancy, gender, family situation and health history), assets, income, costs, and available alternatives.&lt;ref name="Tex" /&gt; The NAIC's [http://www.tdi.texas.gov/pubs/consumer/cb032.html A Shopper’s Guide to Long-Term Care Insurance] contains a set of worksheets that can help you decide if long-term care insurance is needed (pages 7, 56).

==Tax implications==
You may be able to deduct part of the premium you pay for a tax-qualified long-term care policy from your taxes as a medical expense. In addition, you are generally not required to claim your qualified long-term care policy benefits as taxable income. However, in the case of an indemnity policy, you might have to pay taxes on any benefits the policy pays above costs that pay for care.&lt;ref name="Tex" /&gt;

All policies sold before January 1, 1997, are automatically tax-qualified and policies sold later are either tax-qualified or non-tax-qualified. To determine whether your policy is tax-qualified, look for a statement on your policy similar to this: “This policy is intended to be a qualified long-term care insurance contract as defined by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, Section 7702B(b).”&lt;ref name="Tex" /&gt;

Qualified LTCI premiums or care are medical expenses that can be paid from a [[Health savings account | health savings account]] or itemized as a medical expense (subject to AGI restrictions) from the tax return, subject to age restrictions.  See [http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p502.pdf IRS Pub. 502].

Qualified long-term care services are necessary diagnostic, preventive, therapeutic, curing, treating, mitigating, rehabilitative services, and maintenance and personal care services that are:&lt;ref name="IRS502"&gt;[http://www.irs.gov/publications/p502/ar02.html#en_US_publink1000178974 IRS Publication 502]&lt;/ref&gt;

:*Required by a chronically ill individual, and
:*Provided pursuant to a plan of care prescribed by a licensed health care practitioner.

A qualified long-term care insurance contract is an insurance contract that provides only coverage of qualified long-term care services. The contract must:&lt;ref name="IRS502" /&gt;

:*Be guaranteed renewable,
:*Not provide for a cash surrender value or other money that can be paid, assigned, pledged, or borrowed,
:*Generally not pay or reimburse expenses incurred for services or items that would be reimbursed under [[:Medicare]], and
:*(see IRS Pub 502 for additional exceptions)

You can include the following as medical expenses on Schedule A (Form 1040), subject to the 7.5% AGI (Adjusted Gross Income) limit.&lt;ref name="IRS502" /&gt;

Premiums for non-tax-qualified long-term care policies are not tax deductible. In addition, you might have to pay taxes on any benefits the policy pays above costs that pay for care.&lt;ref name="Tex" /&gt;

==How policies work==
*'''Benefit criteria:''' Policies have different benefit eligibility criteria (also called triggers) that you must meet before the company will pay benefits. These are based on how many of the six activities of daily (ADLs) you cannot perform or whether you have a cognitive impairment.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The six ADLs are bathing, eating, dressing, using the bathroom, continence, and moving from a bed or chair.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tex" /&gt;

:* ''Tax-qualified policies'' require that you be unable to perform two of the six ADLs without substantial assistance for at least 90 days or have a cognitive impairment, such as Alzheimer’s. You must also have a plan of care prescribed by a doctor.&lt;ref name="Tex" /&gt;

:* ''Non tax-qualified policies'' may offer a different combination of benefit eligibility criteria but most are based on ADLs and cognitive impairment. Criteria are not restricted to two ADLs. Medical necessity or other measures of disability can be offered as benefit criteria.&lt;ref name="Tex" /&gt;

*'''Elimination period:''' The elimination period is the amount of time you have to wait before a policy will pay any benefits. The most common options are for benefits to start at zero, 20, 30, 60, 90, or 100 days after you enter a nursing home or start receiving other services.&lt;ref name="Tex" /&gt;

*'''Benefit period:''' A benefit period is the amount of time a policy will pay benefits. Benefit periods may range from a minimum of one year to a lifetime. The most commonly offered benefit periods are one, two, three, or five years, or for a lifetime.&lt;ref name="Tex" /&gt;

===How benefits are paid===
Benefits are generally paid using one of three different methods: the expense-incurred method, the indemnity method, or the disability method. It is important to read the literature that accompanies your policy (or certificate for group policies) and to compare the benefits and premiums.&lt;ref name="NAIC15"&gt;[http://www.newyorklife.com/newyorklife.com/General/FileLink/Static%20Files/NYL2/pdf/LTC_Shopper_Guide.pdf A Shopper’s Guide to Long-Term Care Insurance], from NAIC, page 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

:*'''Expense-incurred:''' Policies using the expense-incurred method only pay benefits when you receive an eligible service. The company will pay the benefit amount – either the cost of the expense or the dollar limit of your policy, whichever is less -- to you or your provider. Most policies today pay benefits using the expense-incurred method.&lt;ref name="Tex" /&gt;

:*'''Indemnity method:''' Policies using the indemnity method pay a set dollar amount up to the limit of the policy regardless of the cost of the service you receive. For tax qualified policies that pay benefits using the indemnity method, benefits that you receive above the costs of long-term care services may be taxable.&lt;ref name="Tex" /&gt;

:*'''Disability method:''' When the disability method is used, you are only required to meet the benefit eligibility criteria. Once you do, you receive your full daily benefit,even if you are not receiving any long-term care services.&lt;ref name="NAIC15" /&gt;

==Services covered by long-term care insurance==
Long-term care insurance policies may pay for several types of care, including:&lt;ref name="Tex" /&gt;
:*Nursing home care in a licensed nursing home.
:*Assisted living care in a licensed assisted living home.
:*Home health care services that may include skilled nursing care and physical therapy. A licensed home health agency generally must provide this care.
:*Adult day care in a licensed center. Typical benefits include nursing or therapeutic care, social and educational activities, or personal supervision.
:*Other services. Some policies will pay for hospice care, respite care (care to allow family members who are caregivers to have time off), care after a hospital stay, help with household chores, or caregiver training for family members. 

*'''Coverage amounts:''' A policy may pay different amounts for different types of long-term care services.&lt;ref name="Tex" /&gt;

*'''Daily, weekly, and monthly benefit limits:''' Policies normally pay benefits by the day, week, or month. For example, a policy that pays with the expense-incurred method might pay a daily nursing home benefit of up to $200 per day or $6,000 per month, and a weekly home care benefit of up to $1,400 per week.&lt;ref name="Tex" /&gt;

*'''Maximum benefit limit:''' Most policies limit the total benefit they will pay over the life of the policy. Some policies state the maximum benefit limit in years (one, two, three, or more, or lifetime). Others policies list the maximum benefit limit as a total dollar amount. The maximum benefit limit may be called a total lifetime benefit, a maximum lifetime benefit, or a total plan benefit.&lt;ref name="Tex" /&gt;

Long-term care policies may exclude coverage for some conditions, either completely or for a limited time. Policies typically exclude:&lt;ref name="Tex" /&gt;
:*''Preexisting conditions.'' A preexisting condition is an illness or disability for which you received medical advice or treatment in the six months prior to applying for long-term care coverage. A long-term care policy can delay coverage of a preexisting condition for up to six months after the policy’s effective date.
:*''Mental and nervous disorders.'' A long-term care policy can exclude coverage of some mental and nervous disorders, but the policy must cover Alzheimer’s disease and other age-related disorders. (However, a company can deny to sell a policy to a person already suffering from Alzheimer’s.) A long-term care policy must also cover all serious biologically based mental illnesses and brain diseases, such as schizophrenia or major depressive disorders.
:*''Care by family members.'' Most policies will not pay members of your family to take care of you. However, some policies will pay to train family members to be caregivers.

==Optional features==
Companies must offer inflation protection and a nonforfeiture benefit. The benefits are usually available for an additional premium.&lt;ref name="Tex" /&gt;

===Inflation protection===
Policies must offer inflation protection in at least one of the following ways:&lt;ref name="Tex" /&gt;
:*Benefits automatically increase by 5 percent or more each year, compounded annually.
:*Your original benefit amount increases by 5 percent or more compounded each year on the policy’s renewal date. If you don’t want the increase, you must reject it in writing within 30 days after the policy renewal date.
:*The policy covers a specified percentage of actual or reasonable charges for as long as you own it, with no maximum daily limit or policy limit. 

The company must give you a graphic comparison of benefits on a policy with and without inflation protection over a 20-year period. If you don’t want inflation protection, you must reject it in writing.&lt;ref name="Tex" /&gt; 

===Nonforfeiture benefit===
Companies must offer you a guarantee that you will receive some of the benefits you paid for even if you later cancel or lose coverage. This guarantee is called a nonforfeiture benefit. In most cases, the longer you pay premiums on the policy, the larger the nonforfeiture benefit will be.&lt;ref name="Tex" /&gt;

Generally, a nonforfeiture benefit will either pay up to the total amount of all premiums paid or 30 times the daily nursing home benefit at the time the policy lapsed, whichever is greater.&lt;ref name="Tex" /&gt;

A nonforfeiture benefit can significantly increase a policy’s premium. If you decide not to buy a nonforfeiture benefit, you must reject the offer in writing and the company must explain its contingent nonforfeiture benefit.&lt;ref name="Tex" /&gt;

A '''high deductible health plan''' (HDHP) is a health plan which pays nothing except for preventive care until the deductible is met. If your plan meets IRS requirements and you have no other health insurance, you are allowed to invest in a [[Health savings account |health savings account]] (HSA), which allows you to deduct contributions to the account from your taxes, pay medical expenses from the account tax-free, and invest unused money for future medical expenses.

==How the plan works==
An HDHP makes insurance payments in the same way that most other insurance with a deductible works. If you have auto insurance with a $1,000 deductible, you pay the full repair bill if it is less than $1,000, but you have protection against catastrophic loss because you pay only $1,000 if your $20,000 car is totaled. 

Most health insurance, even if it has a deductible, provides significant benefits before you have met the deductible. Typically, you pay a co-payment (a fixed dollar amount or percentage) for each doctor's visit or prescription; in a plan with a deductible, you will pay full price for doctor visits, lab tests, prescription drugs, hospital visits up to the deductible, and then possibly co-insurance or co-payments up to the policy maximum.

An HDHP is not allowed to pay for anything except preventive care until you have paid the deductible out of pocket. If the plan has negotiated prices with providers (such as an HMO or PPO), you pay only the negotiated price. However, many employer-provided HDHPs make a contribution to your health savings account, so you do not need to come up with the whole deductible out of pocket. (You can also contribute more to the HSA on your own, up to the IRS limit.)

===Catastrophic coverage===
The most important reason for having insurance is protection against catastrophe. An HDHP must have a catastrophic coverage limit; after you have paid that much out of pocket (or from your HSA), the plan must pay 100% of your covered expenses (including prescription drugs) as long as you get your medical care within the network. Some conventional plans also have catastrophic limits, but they may have restrictions such as paying 100% for medical services but still requiring co-payments for prescription drugs. 

===IRS requirements===
The IRS requirements change year by year, indexed for inflation.
For 2025, the minimum deductible for an HDHP is $1,650 for an individual plan, $3,300 for a family plan, and the maximum catastrophic limit is $8,300 for an individual plan, $16,600 for a family plan&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/irb/2024-22_IRB|title=IRS Revenue Procedure 2024-25 in Internal Revenue Bulletin 2024-22|publisher=IRS|accessdate=6 November 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;For 2026, the minimum deductible for an HDHP is $1,700 for an individual plan, $3,400 for a family plan, and the maximum catastrophic limit is $8,500 for an individual plan, $17,000 for a family plan&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/rp-25-19.pdf|title=IRS Revenue Procedure 2025-19 |publisher=IRS|accessdate=27 November 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of the actual deductibles, you can contribute up to $4,300 for 2025 and $4,300 for 2026 to a health savings account if you have an individual plan, $8,550 for 2025 and $8,7550 for 2026 if you have a family plan, plus $1,000 catch-up contributions if you are at least 55. If the family plan has individual deductibles, they cannot be lower than the $3,400 family plan minimum deductible. Family plans can also have a shared deductible in which any one member of the family can meet the deductible requirement.

====Qualifying HDHP plan statement====
It is important to note that not all plans with a deductible high enough to meet the limits will qualify for a [[Health savings account |health savings account]], due to other specific requirements of the IRS such as prescription drug coverage. Each individual HDHP insurance policy must include a statement that it is a "Qualifying High Deductible Health Plan" or a reference to "IRC Section 223" in order to be a qualifying plan to allow contributions to an HSA.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.health--savings--accounts.com/pdf/HSA-Special-Report.pdf HSA for America 2009 Special Report] page 7).&lt;/ref&gt; The insurance policy must also agree to report the list of policyholders to the IRS, so the IRS can cross-check HSA account holders to HDHP insurance policy holders and audit accordingly.

====Other health coverage====
The IRS has specific rules about outside health coverage you can have while covered by an HDHP in order to be eligible for a [[Health savings account |health savings account]]. You can have insurance for worker's compensation, a specific/disease or illness, a fixed amount per day for hospitalization, accident, disability, dental care, vision care, and long-term care. No other first-dollar medical insurance is allowed. A common strategy for those than have an HDHP is to have an alternate accident policy to lower their deductible substantially in the case of accidents. You are also not allowed to enroll in a [[Flexible spending arrangement | flexible spending arrangement]] unless it is limited to covering dental and vision expenses only. Use a [[Health savings account | health savings account]] instead.&lt;ref&gt; See [http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p969.pdf IRS Pub. 969] page 4 for details of all of these requirements.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Prescription drug coverage====
Since January 1, 2006, HDHPs have been required to count the full price of prescription drugs up to the annual deductible, exceptions can be made if the prescription is preventative.&lt;ref&gt; See [http://www.hsainsider.com/pdf/roadrules/HSA_Road_Rules_Consumer_9th_Edition_2009.pdf HSA Insider Road Rules] page 5, section 2g).&lt;/ref&gt; If a plan provides any prescription drug benefit before the annual deductible is met (except in the case of preventative prescription drugs) it is not a qualifying HDHP for a [[Health savings account| health savings account]].

==Financial advantages and disadvantages==
Since the payment structure of an HDHP is very different, you may owe significantly more or less with an HDHP than with a conventional plan. You will need to work out the costs yourself. Remember to count the value of the plan's contribution to the HSA, and the subsidy on your own contributions. For example, if the plan contributes $1,200 and you contribute another $2,650 in a 22% tax bracket, it costs you only $2,067 out of pocket to put $3,850 in your HSA, so you have a net gain of $1,783 before you pay any costs. (If your conventional plan allows you to use a [[Flexible spending arrangement | flexible spending arrangement]], that provides a similar benefit, but only on the amount that you can be sure you will spend.)

You are most likely to benefit from an HDHP if you are either in good health or have very high prescription drug costs. If you are in good health, your expenses will usually be far less than the deductible, so the high deductible does not matter, and you have good coverage for the catastrophic insurance that you need. If you have very high prescription costs, the fact that prescriptions count toward the deductible and catastrophic limit may mean that you will pay less in total with an HDHP, rather than alternative coverage with no out-of-pocket maximum for prescription drugs. If your medical costs are near the deductible, you may be better off with a conventional plan, as the HDHP will cover nothing but the conventional plan will cover some of the costs. Compare the lower premium of the HDHP with the deductible to the alternative plan's higher premium, smaller deductible, and co-payments. It may be good to graph a visual representation using excel to chart out of pocket costs including premium vs. actual medical expenses to help with this comparison.

You may also benefit from the HDHP, regardless of the costs, if your employer gives a percentage subsidy on health insurance, because the insurer's contribution to the HSA benefits from the same subsidy. For example, if your employer pays 75% of your health insurance, it costs you only $250 to receive benefits which cost the insurer $1,000, even if that $1,000 benefit is a contribution to your HSA.

At some employers, the premium + out of pocket maximum of the HDHP are lower cost than the premium alone of the conventional co-payment plan. It is also not unreasonable for the HDHP premium to be $0 and/or have employer contributions to your HSA. In this case, choosing the HDHP is an easy decision, even if you have high medical expenses.

Consider that in some states, state income tax is owed on [[Health savings account |health savings account]] contributions, which may factor in this calculation. See the [[Health savings account]] page for more information.

===Examples===
These examples are not necessarily illustrative of any particular plans, but they show how the subsidy makes the HDHP more attractive, and may make it a better option for anyone with a percentage subsidy.

Below are some tools to help you compare available options
*[[Tools_and_calculators#Personal_finance_toolbox|Personal finance toolbox]] ('HDHP Analysis' tab)
*[https://thefinancebuff.com/hmo-ppo-vs-high-deductible-hdhp-hsa.html Do The Math: HMO/PPO vs High Deductible Plan With HSA], by [[The Finance Buff]], November 1, 2016.

====Individual plans or employer plans with no subsidy====
Suppose that you can get an individual plan or an HDHP each for the same cost, the HDHP has a $2,500 deductible, and you are in a 32% combined federal and state tax bracket. If you use the HDHP, you can contribute $4,150 to your HSA, getting a $1,328 tax saving compared to putting the same money in a [[Roth IRA]] which would also grow tax-free. Therefore, you save $1,328 if you have no medical expenses, or if your expenses are the same under either plan.

If you have $2,000 in medical expenses under the HDHP and pay the expenses from your HSA, and the conventional plan makes you pay $500 for the same expenses, the conventional plan is a better deal. And if you can deduct your medical expenses (because the insurance all by itself costs more than 10% of your income, and you itemize deductions), then the conventional plan looks still better; if you pay $500 out of pocket, you save $160 in taxes, making your total savings $340. Therefore, if you will be near the deductible, the HDHP will cost you money.

If your employer offers a plan with no subsidy, or with a fixed-dollar subsidy (say $3000 towards any plan), the numbers work out essentially the same. If the employer's HDHP costs an extra $1,000 and contributes $1,000 to your HSA, that is break-even for you (as long as you either deduct the premium or pay with premium conversion).

====Employer plans with subsidy====
Now suppose that your employer offers a standard plan for $4,000, or an HDHP for $5,000 with a $2,500 deductible and a $1,500 contribution to your HSA. Also suppose that your employer pays 75% of your premium for any policy, offers premium conversion, and that your combined federal, state, and Social Security tax rate is 40%.

The conventional plan thus costs you $1,000, which is $600 after tax. The HDHP costs you $1,250, which is $750 after tax, but you get $1,500 free in the HSA and a $1,060 tax saving on the $2,650 you contribute, a total of $2,560. The HSA savings is now $2,410.

Even if you use the entire deductible of the HDHP, you will almost certainly come out ahead; if you have $2,500 in HDHP expenses and would have paid more than $90 under the conventional plan, the HDHP costs less. And if you have more than $2,500 in medical expenses so that the HDHP pays something, it is likely to be even better because of the catastrophic coverage rules.

==Non-financial concerns==
Since the HDHP does not cover expenses until the deductible is met, it creates an incentive to avoid medical costs, even necessary ones. You should not use an HDHP if the potential of a $100 doctor's bill, or a $200 prescription, or a $1000 emergency-room bill, might discourage you from getting the care you need.

A '''health flexible spending arrangement (FSA)''', alternately known as a ''flexible spending account'', allows employees to be reimbursed for medical expenses. FSAs are usually funded through voluntary salary reduction agreements with your employer. No employment or federal income taxes are deducted from your contribution. The employer may also contribute.

==FSA benefits==
There are several benefits from having an FSA:
*Contributions made by your employer can be excluded from your gross income
*No employment or federal income taxes are deducted from the contributions, which reduces the amount of tax withdrawn from your salary.
*Withdrawals may be tax free if you pay qualified medical expenses (see [[#Qualified Medical Expenses | Qualified Medical Expenses]]).
*You can withdraw funds from the account to pay qualified medical expenses even if you have not yet placed the funds in the account.

==Qualifying for an FSA==

Health FSAs are employer-established benefit plans. These may be offered in conjunction with other employer-provided benefits as part of a cafeteria plan. Employers have complete flexibility to offer various combinations of benefits in designing their plan. You do not have to be covered under any other health care plan to participate.

===Limitations===
*Self-employed persons are not eligible for an FSA.
*Certain limitations may apply if you are a [[Highly compensated employee |highly compensated participant or a key employee]].
*If you contribute to a general-purpose FSA, commonly called a ''health'', ''healthcare'' or ''medical'' FSA, you may not contribute to a [[Health savings account]] (HSA) even if you have an otherwise-qualifying [[High Deductible Health Plan]].&lt;ref name="Pub 969"&gt;[http://www.irs.gov/publications/p969/ar02.html#en_US_publink100038739 IRS Pub. 969] - Qualifying for an HSA - Other employee health plans&lt;/ref&gt; You may, however contribute to both a HSA and a [[#Limited-purpose FSA|limited-purpose FSA]].

==Contributions to an FSA==

You contribute to your FSA by electing an amount to be voluntarily withheld from your pay by your employer. This is sometimes called a salary reduction agreement. The employer may also contribute to your FSA if specified in the plan.

You do not pay federal income tax or employment taxes on the salary you contribute or the amounts your employer contributes to the FSA. However, contributions made by your employer to provide coverage for long-term care insurance must be included in income.

==When to contribute==

At the beginning of the plan year, you must designate how much you want to contribute. Then, your employer will deduct amounts periodically (generally, every payday) in accordance with your annual election. You can change or revoke your election only if there is a change in your employment or family status that is specified by the plan.&lt;ref name="Pub 969"/&gt;

==Amount of contribution==

Starting in 2013, there was a maximum contribution limit of $2,500, adjusted for inflation in subsequent years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/search/pagedetails.action?st=%22PUBLIC+LAW+111%E2%80%93148%22&amp;granuleId=&amp;packageId=PLAW-111publ148 Public Law 111 - 148 - Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act], Sections 9005 and 10902 from the [http://www.gpo.gov/about/ U.S. Government Printing Office]. The starting date was amended to 2013 in [http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/search/pagedetails.action?st=%22public+law%22+111-152&amp;granuleId=&amp;packageId=PLAW-111publ152 Public Law 111 - 152 - Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010], Section 1403. The final law is in [http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/search/pagedetails.action?granuleId=USCODE-2010-title26-subtitleA-chap1-subchapB-partIII-sec125&amp;packageId=USCODE-2010-title26 26 U.S.C. 125 - Cafeteria plans] (Internal Revenue Code) Amendment of Subsection(I).&lt;/ref&gt; The maximum contribution limit is $3,300 in 2025 and $3,400 in 2026.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/rp-25-32.pdf Revenue Procedure 25-32], from the IRS.&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, contributed amounts that are not spent by the end the plan year are forfeited (see [[#Balance in an FSA | Balance in an FSA]]), later. For this reason, it is important to base your contribution on an estimate of the qualifying expenses you will have during the year.

==Distributions from an FSA==
Generally, distributions from a health FSA must be paid only to reimburse you for qualified medical expenses you incurred during the period of coverage. You must be able to receive the maximum amount of reimbursement (the amount you have elected to contribute for the year) at any time during the coverage period, regardless of the amount you have actually contributed. The maximum amount you can receive tax free is the total amount you elected to contribute to the health FSA for the year.&lt;ref name="Pub959"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.irs.gov/publications/p969 |title=Publication 969 (2017), Health Savings Accounts and Other Tax-Favored Health Plans |publisher=IRS |date=Mar 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

You must provide the health FSA with a written statement from an independent third party stating that the medical expense has been incurred and the amount of the expense. You must also provide a written statement that the expense has not been paid or reimbursed under any other health plan coverage. The FSA cannot make advance reimbursements of future or projected expenses.

Debit cards, credit cards, and stored value cards given to you by your employer can be used to reimburse participants in a health FSA. If the use of these cards meets certain substantiation methods, you may not have to provide additional information to the health FSA.

==Qualified medical expenses==
Qualified medical expenses are those specified in the plan that would generally qualify for the medical and dental expenses deduction. These are explained in IRS Publication 502.&lt;ref name="Pub502"&gt;[http://www.irs.gov/publications/p502/index.html IRS Publication 502, Medical and Dental Expenses]&lt;/ref&gt; However, even though non-prescription medicines (other than insulin) do not qualify for the medical and dental expenses deduction, they do qualify as expenses for FSA purposes.

You cannot receive distributions from your FSA for the following expenses.
*Amounts paid for health insurance premiums.
*Amounts paid for long-term care coverage or expenses.
*Amounts that are covered under another health plan.

You cannot deduct qualified medical expenses as an itemized deduction on Schedule A (Form 1040) that are equal to the distribution you receive from the FSA. 

==Balance in an FSA==
Flexible spending accounts are ''use-it-or-lose-it'' plans. This means that amounts in the account at the end of the plan year cannot be carried over to the next year. However, the plan can provide for a grace period of up to 2½ months after the end of the plan year. If there is a grace period, any qualified medical expenses incurred in that period can be paid from any amounts left in the account at the end of the previous year. Your employer is not permitted to refund any part of the balance to you.&lt;ref name="Pub959" /&gt;

Plans may allow up to $660 in 2025, $680 in 2026 of unused amounts remaining at the end of the plan year to be paid or reimbursed for qualified medical expenses you incur in the following plan year. The plan may specify a lower dollar amount as the maximum carryover amount. If the plan permits a carryover, any unused amounts over the carryover amount are forfeited. The carryover doesn’t affect the maximum amount of salary reduction contributions that you are permitted to make.&lt;ref name="Pub959" /&gt;

A plan may allow either the grace period or a carryover, but it may not allow both.&lt;ref name="Pub959" /&gt;

==Limited-purpose FSA==
A '''limited-purpose FSA''' (LPFSA) is a type of FSA that covers only qualifying dental and vision care.

As described above in [[#Limitations|Limitations]], you may not contribute to both a health FSA and a [[Health savings account]] (HSA). You may, however, have a LPFSA and still contribute to an HSA.

A LPFSA is a different classification of FSA account compared to a standard health FSA. You cannot sign up for a health FSA and simply use it only for qualifying medical and dental expenses and claim it is a LPFSA; you must be sure that you are signing up for a FSA that is explicitly designated as a LPFSA.

Not all employers who offer a health FSA also offer a LPFSA.

A HSA combined with a LPFSA offers employees the ability to maximize their tax-advantaged savings. As with a standard FSA, an individual contemplating a LPFSA should attempt to estimate anticipated dental and vision expenses to avoid forfeiting unused balances.

If an individual is not enrolled in a HSA, then there is no reason to choose a LPFSA over a FSA.

      <text bytes="39880" sha1="1tmyedjhs3f5oy8ikj6rqm0gs7kshvk" xml:space="preserve">'''{{PAGENAME}}''' describes the impact medical spending could have on your retirement and how to incorporate it into your retirement planning.

==Overview==

No other area better illustrates how spending habits change as we grow older. In a 2009 — 2010 BLS survey, households with members age 62 and older reported spending 11.3% of annual income after taxes on healthcare, including insurance. The average for all households, including the elderly, was 6.9%. Medical costs outpaced overall inflation from 1983 — 2012 except for 1996 according to the BLS, and medical costs grew 5.1% annually in that time frame. &lt;ref&gt;Adam Zoll, [http://news.morningstar.com/articlenet/article.aspx?id=567105 "Don't Discount Inflation When Planning for Retirement"], September 10, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; 

From 2006 — 2011 both the experimental CPI-Elderly (62 years and older) and the CPI for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) rose at the same annual rate of 2.3%. This turnaround was caused by changes in medical care and shelter: the gap between medical care inflation and overall inflation has generally fallen since 2005, and shelter inflation has been rising more slowly. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2012/ted_20120302.htm "Consumer Price Index for the elderly"], Bureau of Labor Statistics, March 2, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 it was reported that “Average spending among people who are 64 years old is about 4.8 times as high as average spending among people who are 21 years old,” according to the Congressional Budget Office last year, citing research by actuaries. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/05/us/politics/health-care-law-obamacare-repeal-older-americans.html "Repeal of Health Law Hits a New Snag: Older Adults"], ''The New York Times'', March 6, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health Conditions==

Unlike employer insurance plans, Medicare plans cover only individuals, not couples or families. Chronic health conditions will increase doctor, hospital, and drug costs, and may make one combination of Medicare supplemental plans better than another.

The percentage among Medicare beneficiaries in 2010 of the 15 most common chronic conditions were:
{|class="wikitable" style="width: 70%;"
!colspan="6"|2010 Medicare Chronic Conditions &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cms.gov/research-statistics-data-and-systems/statistics-trends-and-reports/chronic-conditions/downloads/2012chartbook.pdf "Chronic Conditions among Medicare Beneficiaries, Chartbook"], Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
| style="width: 34%;"| 1. High blood pressure (58%) || style="width: 33%;"| 6. Heart failure (16%) || style="width: 33%;"| 11. Atrial fibrillation (8%)

|-
| 3. Heart disease (31%) || 8. Depression (14%) || 13. Osteoporosis (7%)
|-
| 4. Arthritis (29%) || 9. COPD (12%) || 14. Asthma (5%)
|-
| 5. Diabetes (28%) || 10. Alzheimer's disease (11%) || 15. Stroke (4%)
|}

Over two-thirds of beneficiaries had two or more chronic conditions, and 14% had 6 or more. Beneficiaries with 4 or more chronic conditions had higher than average Medicare spending. Beneficiaries with 6 or more chronic conditions had over 3 times the average Medicare spending; these beneficiaries were more likely to have heart failure, chronic kidney disease, COPD, atrial fibrillation, and stroke. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cms.gov/research-statistics-data-and-systems/statistics-trends-and-reports/chronic-conditions/downloads/2012chartbook.pdf "Chronic Conditions among Medicare Beneficiaries, Chartbook"], Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Those 80 and older are more likely to have multiple chronic conditions and functional limitations, and this combination (compared to chronic conditions only) is associated with 
* increased emergency department visits and inpatient hospitalizations, and
* higher Medicare spending for inpatient hospital, skilled nursing facility, and home health services. &lt;ref&gt;Tricia Neuman, Juliette Cubanski, Jennifer Huang, and Anthony Damico, [http://kff.org/medicare/report/the-rising-cost-of-living-longer-analysis-of-medicare-spending-by-age-for-beneficiaries-in-traditional-medicare/ "The Rising Cost of Living Longer: Analysis of Medicare Spending by Age for Beneficiaries in Traditional Medicare"], Kaiser Family Foundation, January 14, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health Insurance==

If you paid off your mortgage before retirement, you probably changed from itemized to standard deduction on your tax returns. After retirement, paying for health insurance alone will move you back to itemized deductions. 

===Medicare===
{{See also|Medicare}}
Medicare Part A (Hospital) is paid by previous payroll deductions, and Medicare Part B (Doctor) premiums are standardized, but these plans only cover 80% of hospital and doctor costs. 

Medicare Part A and B is sometimes called original, traditional or fee-for-service Medicare to differentiate from Medicare Advantage health maintenance organization (HMO) or preferred provider organization (PPO) plans. Original Medicare is usually bundled with private supplemental (Medigap) and drug insurance plans (below) to provide similar benefits.

|-
| Part B premium || People on Social Security pay $104.90 each month. For those who have not started Social Security, the premium increased to $121.80 per month in December 2015.
|-
| Part B deductible and coinsurance || $166 per year. After your deductible is met, you typically pay 20% of the ''Medicare-approved amount'' for most doctor services (including most doctor services while you're a hospital inpatient), outpatient therapy, and ''durable medical equipment''.&lt;br /&gt;

''Medicare-approved amount'' is the amount a doctor or supplier that accepts Medicare assignment can be paid. It may be less than the actual amount a doctor or supplier charges. Medicare pays part of this amount and you're responsible for the difference.&lt;br /&gt;

''Durable medical equipment'' is certain medical equipment, like a walker, wheelchair, or hospital bed, ordered by your doctor for use in the home.

In 2010 the most popular Medigap plan was Plan F (60% of total spending), followed by Plan C (21%) and Plans B and D (5% each). Plan F was in the middle of the original Plan A to J range of benefits and expense.  Plan F was also the least expensive to offer 100% coverage on Part B excess charges and the Part B deductible. &lt;ref&gt;[https://weissmedigap.com/information-center/popular-medigap-plans Popular Medigap Plans], Weiss Ratings Medigap, retrieved August 6, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

A Medicare health plan is offered by a private company that contracts with Medicare to provide Part A and B benefits to people with Medicare who enroll in the plan. The two most common are Medicare Advantage plans and Medicare Medical Savings Account (MSA) plans. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.medicare.gov/sign-up-change-plans/medicare-health-plans/medicare-health-plans.html "About Medicare health plans"], Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services, retrieved August 6, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Medicare Medical Savings Account====

Medicare Medical Savings Account (MSA) plans combine 
# A high-deductible health plan: The first part is a special type of high-deductible Medicare Advantage Plan (Part C). The plan will only begin to cover your costs once you meet a high yearly deductible, which varies by plan.
# A Medical Savings Account (MSA): The second part is a special type of savings account. The Medicare MSA Plan deposits money into your account. You can choose to use money from this savings account to pay your healthcare costs before you meet the deductible.

In addition to the Medicare services that all Medicare Advantage Plans must cover, some plans may cover extra benefits for an extra cost, like dental, vision, or long-term care not covered by Medicare. Medicare MSA Plans do not cover Medicare Part D prescription drugs; this would require a separate Prescription drug plan (Part D). &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.medicare.gov/sign-up-change-plans/medicare-health-plans/medicare-savings-accounts/medical-savings-account-plans.html "Medicare Medical Savings Account (MSA) Plans"], Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, retrieved August 6, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dental===
{{See also|Dental insurance}}

A common complaint on the Bogleheads&amp;reg; Forum is that dental and long-term care insurance insurance cover small expenses that many could self-insure, but not high expenses causing financial hardship. &lt;ref&gt;{{forum post|t=192958#p2935735|title=Re: Dental insurance, dental plans or pay as you go?}}, June 9, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; The consensus is that dental insurance is not worthwhile unless it is an employee benefit. Many dentists participate in dental discount plans, such as [http://coast2coastrx.com/index.php/more-benefits/discount-dental-plan Coast2Coast Rx Card].

You may need long-term care if you are unable to care for yourself due to physical illness, disability, or cognitive impairment, such as Alzheimer’s disease. You can receive long-term care at home or in a hospice, adult day care center, nursing home, or assisted living facility. 

Long-term care insurance can help protect your assets against the high cost of extended long-term care. However, a common complaint on the Bogleheads&amp;reg; Forum is that dental and long-term care insurance insurance cover small expenses that many could self-insure, but not high expenses causing financial hardship. &lt;ref&gt;{{forum post|t=192958#p2935735|title=Re: Dental insurance, dental plans or pay as you go?}}, June 9, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; If you don’t have long-term care insurance, you may have to pay down your assets until you qualify for Medicaid.

To determine whether long-term care insurance is right for you, consider your personal risk factors:
* life expectancy,  
* gender,  
* family health history,  
* assets, and  
* available alternatives.

==Reviewing and changing Medicare plans==
&lt;br&gt;

{{ambox|text=The benefit of reviewing Medicare Advantage (Part C) and Prescription drug plans (Part D) annually with the [https://www.medicare.gov/find-a-plan/questions/home.aspx Medicare Plan Finder] cannot be emphasized enough. Plans change yearly, and what was once a bargain can become very expensive. The costs and coverages of plans available to you can be compared online, and changes made at no additional cost during the annual open enrollment period from October 15–December 7. A Part D Prescription drug plan change can result in a 37% savings with no change in coverage.}}


Changes between original Medicare (Part A and B) with a Medigap supplement, and Medicare Advantage (Part C), can also be made but require careful study in advance. For example, insurance companies can base Medigap approval and premium on pre-existing medical conditions after the initial enrollment period at 65. You can get local, personalized Medicare counseling from your [https://www.shiptacenter.org/ State Health Insurance Assistance Program (SHIP)].

==Life Expectancy Calculators==

===Social Security Administration===

If you are considering when to collect Social Security retirement benefits, one factor is how long you might live. The Social Security Administration's [https://www.ssa.gov/oact/population/longevity.html Life Expectancy Calculator] uses data compiled by the Social Security Administration. For example:

* A man reaching age 65 in 2016 can expect to live, on average, until age 84.2.
* A woman turning age 65 in 2016 can expect to live, on average, until age 86.6.

About one out of every four 65-year-olds in 2016 will live past age 90, and one out of 10 will live past age 95. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ssa.gov/planners/lifeexpectancy.html Calculators: Life Expectancy], Social Security Administration, retrieved August 7, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a federal public health insurance program for the elderly and qualified disabled.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cms.hhs.gov/medicaregeninfo/ HHS.gov Medicare Program General Information]&lt;/ref&gt; It is a financing program not a health delivery system. It relies on private health providers to deliver health care to program beneficiaries. Private providers are paid by Medicare, either directly via Original Medicare or through an intermediary system of private insurers: Medicare Advantage (MA) or stand-alone prescription drug plans (PDPs).

==Overview==

Medicare was established in 1965 under Title XVIII of the Social Security Act to provide health insurance for elderly Americans. Prior to Medicare, nearly half the elderly lacked health insurance. Today, health insurance for the elderly is nearly universal. Medicare was expanded in 1972 to provide health insurance to non-elderly disabled individuals. In total, Medicare provides coverage to 62.6 million Americans: 54.1 million aged 65 and older and another 8.5 million non-elderly with permanent disabilities [as of 2020]. Medicare spent $915.4 billion in FY 2020 out of total Federal spending of $6.6 trillion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=August 31, 2021|title=2021 Annual Report of the Boards of Trustees of the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund|url=https://www.cms.gov/files/document/2021-medicare-trustees-report.pdf|access-date=April 1, 2022|website=Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services|series=Table V.F1}} Total Medicare expenditures to the public is the sum of Columns HI (Medicare Part A) and SMI (Medicare Part B and Part D).&lt;/ref&gt;

Medicare is organized into four parts: A, B, C, and D.

Part A is hospital insurance, funded by a 2.9% payroll tax (shared equally between employer and employee).

Part B is physician and outpatient coverage, funded by premiums and general revenue. Parts A and B are called ''Original Medicare''.

Part C is the Medicare Advantage program, under which private insurers bundle Parts A, B, and in some cases D, and receive a fixed payment from Medicare to provide coverage for each enrollee. Medicare Advantage enrollees must still pay the Part B premium.

Part D is the prescription drug benefit, funded by general revenue and beneficiary premiums. Part D benefits can be obtained in two ways: either (1) purchased on a stand-alone basis, or (2) when combined with Part C.&lt;ref&gt;{{Forum post| p = 6600594 | title = Re: Wiki - Medicare article overhaul | author = Big Dog | date = April 03, 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Additional notes:'''

*For supplemental coverage, you can have a Medicare Advantage plan OR a Medigap plan, but not both.
*Plans C and F are only available to people who were newly eligible for Medicare prior to January 1, 2020.
*Don’t confuse Medigap Plan A and Medigap Plan B with Medicare Parts A and B. Original Medicare includes Medicare Part A, which is inpatient hospital coverage, and Medicare Part B, Medicare Part B covers all physicians fees, either on an inpatient or outpatient basis. Medigap Plans A and Plan B are supplemental insurance to cover the costs Original Medicare leaves behind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=March 8, 2022|title=Medicare Supplement Plans Comparison Chart for 2022|url=https://www.medicarefaq.com/medicare-supplements/medigap-plans/|access-date=April 3, 2022|website=MedicareFAQ.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In addition, Medicare Part B covers outpatient services, such as biopsies, blood tests, CAT scans, MRIs, etc. that are done on an outpatient basis.  Also, chemotherapy by infusion done on an outpatient basis, which can be extraordinarily expensive and that alone may warrant someone on Original Medicare getting a Medigap plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Forum post|p=6606828|title=Re: Wiki - Medicare article overhaul|author=ModifiedDuration|date=April 06, 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Your contribution limit for this year is reduced by the number of months you become ineligible to contribute to the HSA.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Contribution limits are defined on the Line 3 Limitation Chart and Worksheet in the Instructions for [https://www.irs.gov/instructions/i8889 Form 8889, Health Savings Accounts (HSAs)]. The limitation is determined for each month of the year.&lt;/ref&gt;

If you delayed applying for Medicare and later your enrollment is backdated, any contributions to your HSA made during the period of retroactive coverage are considered excess contributions and will result in a tax penalty.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Medicare Parts B, C, and D premiums, related IRMAA premiums, and any Medicare-related deductibles, co-pays, or coinsurance payments are all HSA-eligible expenses. However, premiums for Medicare Supplement plans are not HSA-eligible expenses.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Publication 969, Health Savings Accounts and Other Tax-Favored Health Plans|url=https://www.irs.gov/publications/p969|access-date=April 2, 2022|website=Internal Revenue Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prescription drug plans ==

In addition to MA plans that offer Part D drug benefits, another private plan type under Medicare is the stand-alone prescription drug plan (PDP). PDPs operate in multi-state regions. Most operate nationally.

PDPs may offer a basic benefit that includes a donut hole or coverage gap (wherein a beneficiary pays 25% of drug costs between the initial coverage and the catastrophic coverage range).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Costs in the coverage gap|url=https://www.medicare.gov/drug-coverage-part-d/costs-for-medicare-drug-coverage/costs-in-the-coverage-gap|access-date=April 7, 2022|website=Medicare.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other PDPs offer enhanced coverage which may include generic or brand coverage in the donut hole and/or a reduced deductible. In 2021, 48 million of the more than 62 million people covered by Medicare are enrolled in Part D plans.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

There is a late enrollment penalty (a permanent addition to your Part D premium) if you don't have Medicare or other [https://www.medicare.gov/drug-coverage-part-d/costs-for-medicare-drug-coverage/part-d-late-enrollment-penalty/3-ways-to-avoid-the-part-d-late-enrollment-penalty creditable drug coverage] within 63 days from the initial enrollment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Part D late enrollment penalty|url=https://www.medicare.gov/drug-coverage-part-d/costs-for-medicare-drug-coverage/part-d-late-enrollment-penalty|access-date=April 3, 2022|website=Medicare.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Prescription Drug Plan should be seriously considered by an Original Medicare beneficiary, as certain prescriptions can be very expensive (particularly a prescription course  for the treatment for cancer) and the Catastrophic Coverage provided by a Prescription Drug Plan (and primarily funded by the Federal Government) would be very worthwhile in such a case.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Forum post|p=6607311|title=Re: Wiki - Medicare article overhaul|author=ModifiedDuration|date=April 07, 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even an Original Medicare beneficiary who does not normally take prescriptions should seriously consider at least an inexpensive Prescription Drug Plan when first eligible, due to the Federally-funded Catastrophic Coverage provided and the lifetime penalty associated with late sign-up to a Prescription Drug Plan.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

==Medicare Advantage==

Medicare Advantage plans, sometimes called “Part C” or “MA Plans,” are offered by Medicare-approved private companies that must follow rules set by Medicare. Most Medicare Advantage Plans include drug coverage (Part D). In most cases, you’ll need to use health care providers who participate in the plan’s network.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Medicare Advantage Plans|url=https://www.medicare.gov/health-drug-plans/health-plans/your-health-plan-options|access-date=September 22, 2023|website=Medicare.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The plans set a limit on what you’ll have to pay out-of-pocket each year for covered services. This limit is called the Maximum Out-Of-Pocket (MOOP) cost and includes all cost-sharing (deductibles, coinsurance, and copayments) for Parts A and B covered services received from in-network providers. Part D cost-sharing does not count towards the MOOP.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Maximum out-of-pocket limit|url=https://www.medicareinteractive.org/get-answers/medicare-health-coverage-options/medicare-advantage-plan-overview/maximum-out-of-pocket-limit|access-date=April 3, 2022|website=Medicare Interactive}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some plans offer non-emergency coverage out of network, but typically at a higher cost.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; 

The most common types of plans are:&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; 

*[https://www.medicare.gov/health-drug-plans/health-plans/your-coverage-options/HMO Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) Plans]
*[https://www.medicare.gov/health-drug-plans/health-plans/your-coverage-options/PPO Preferred Provider Organization (PPO) Plans]

*[https://www.medicare.gov/health-drug-plans/health-plans/your-coverage-options/SNP Special Needs Plans (SNPs)]

Other less common types of Medicare Advantage Plans that may be available include HMO Point Of Service (Hmopos) Plans&lt;ref group="note"&gt;An HMO Plan that may allow you to get some services out-of-network for a higher cost.&lt;/ref&gt; and a [https://www.medicare.gov/health-drug-plans/health-plans/your-coverage-options/MSA Medicare Medical Savings Account (MSA) Plan].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

With a Medicare Advantage plan, healthcare decisions made by you and your doctors are subject to the approval (or denial) of the insurance company offering the Medicare Advantage plan. In contrast, with Original Medicare and a Medicare Supplemental (Medigap) plan, you can receive any Medicare-approved healthcare service without prior authorization from an insurance company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=April 27, 2022|title=Some Medicare Advantage Organization Denials of Prior Authorization Requests Raise Concerns About Beneficiary Access to Medically Necessary Care|url=https://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/OEI-09-18-00260.asp|access-date=April 29, 2022|website=Office of Inspector General}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

MA plans typically have lower up-front premiums than Original Medicare plus Medigap plus Part D; but, depending on healthcare use, the cost of a MA plan can equal or exceed that of Original Medicare plus Medigap plus a stand-alone PDP. This is especially pertinent if the MA insurance company denies coverage for a healthcare service that an enrollee chooses to have, and the enrollee becomes responsible for the entire cost of the non-covered service.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Forum post|p=6600082|title=Re: Wiki - Medicare article overhaul|author=Trurl Klapaucius|date=Apr 3, 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The number of beneficiaries enrolled in MA plans has grown to 25 million in 2020. Between 2011 and 2020, private plan enrollment grew by 12.7 million or 103 percent, compared to growth in the overall Medicare population of 28 percent for the same period. As of 2020, 40% of beneficiaries are enrolled in such plans at a cost of $11,676 per enrollee.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=August 31, 2021|title=2021 Annual Report of the Boards of Trustees of the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund|url=https://www.cms.gov/files/document/2021-medicare-trustees-report.pdf|access-date=April 1, 2022|website=Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services|series=Table IV.C3 (Calendar year 2020)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Supplemental (Medigap) insurance==

Either through an employer or the non-group market, some beneficiaries obtain additional coverage, known as Medigap. Medigap plans are standardized in most states (Massachusetts, WI, MN are exceptions) and cover cost sharing and other benefits not covered by Medicare. 

==Premiums==
{{Main|IRMAA}}

Medicare premiums are set every year. A summary of costs can be found at Medicare.gov: [https://www.medicare.gov/basics/costs/medicare-costs Medicare costs]

Both Part B and Part D premiums can be increased if the Medicare recipient's [[Modified Adjusted Gross Income#MAGI for Medicare premiums (IRMAA tiers)|Modified Adjusted Gross Income]] exceeds certain thresholds, through a system called [[Income-Related Monthly Adjustment Amount (IRMAA)]]. In effect, IRMAA reduces the amount of the premium subsidized by the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Forum post|p=6604909|title=Re: Wiki - Medicare article overhaul|author=fyre4ce|date=April 05, 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt; IRMAA is calculated with a 2 year lag, e.g, IRMAA for 2022 would be based on the 2020 tax return.

You have the right to appeal if you believe that an IRMAA amount is incorrect due to an incorrect tax return or a qualifying life event. Details are provided in [https://www.hhs.gov/about/agencies/omha/the-appeals-process/part-b-premium-appeals/index.html Medicare Part B Premium Appeals]. Social Security Administration [https://medicareportal.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/irmaa-appeal-form.pdf Form SSA-44] is used for life-changing events.

===Part B===
For those enrollees getting [[Social Security]] benefits while not subject to  increased premiums through IRMAA, if the new rate would reduce the net Social Security benefit received, the new rate for them is adjusted so that there is no reduction is Social Security benefits paid (the “hold-harmless” provision).&lt;ref group="note"&gt;If the taxpayer has had a life changing event (as defined by Social Security), the taxpayer may request that an estimated income for the current tax year be used in determining the MAGI and loss of subsidy.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title=42 USC §1395r: Amount of premiums for individuals enrolled under this part|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1395r |access-date=September 10, 2025|website=Cornell Legal Information Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Part B premium costs (including IRMAA), deductibles, and coinsurance can be found at Medicare.gov [https://www.medicare.gov/your-medicare-costs/part-b-costs here].

===Part D===
Part D enrollee premiums vary from plan to plan and are calculated by comparing each plan’s approved Part D bid to the national average monthly bid amount. A plan’s basic Part D premium is equal to the base beneficiary premium plus the difference between the plan’s bid and the national average monthly bid amount and may be reduced by MA rebates.

Part D premiums are also subject to [[IRMAA]] for those with higher incomes on the same tier system as Part B premiums. Beneficiaries with low incomes and modest assets are eligible for assistance with Part D plan premiums and cost sharing, as previously mentioned above.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=2020 Part D Income-Related Monthly Premium Adjustment|url=https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Health-Plans/MedicareAdvtgSpecRateStats/Downloads/PartDIRMAA2020.pdf|access-date=April 1, 2022|website=Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title=An Overview of the Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Benefit|url=https://www.kff.org/medicare/fact-sheet/an-overview-of-the-medicare-part-d-prescription-drug-benefit/|access-date=April 1, 2022|website=Kaiser Family Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shopping for coverage==
You should shop for Medicare coverage on an annual basis. [https://www.medicare.gov/your-medicare-costs Your Medicare costs] is Medicare.gov's starting point for understand costs. A summary of basic costs is provided in [https://www.medicare.gov/your-medicare-costs/medicare-costs-at-a-glance Medicare costs at a glance].

===Plan finder===
Medicare.gov's [https://www.medicare.gov/plan-compare/ Find a Medicare plan] provides cost comparisons for drug plans (Part D) and Medicare Advantage Plans. Enter your zip code and additional information as needed. You can enroll in a plan from this website.

The site will also show you plans that have sanctions placed against them (actions taken when a plan fails to comply with Medicare Part C or Part D requirements). See: [https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Compliance-and-Audits/Part-C-and-Part-D-Compliance-and-Audits/PartCandPartDEnforcementActions- Part C and Part D Enforcement Actions]

Supplement Insurance (Medigap) plans can be found at Medicare.gov's [https://www.medicare.gov/medigap-supplemental-insurance-plans/ Find a Medigap policy that works for you]. Plans will be shown for your state. You will have to contact the company directly to purchase a policy.

Many states have websites that provide detailed pricing by Medigap Plan by insurance company, which can be found through an internet search.

===Original Medicare===
Those enrolled in Original Medicare pathway need to check to see if their Medicare D coverage in the new year will cover their medications at the lowest cost. The drug plans change a lot from year to year.&lt;ref name="nvboglehead"&gt;{{Forum post | p = 6600594 | title = Re: Wiki - Medicare article overhaul | author = nvboglehead | date = April 03, 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The supplemental (Medigap) insurance plans do not change their coverages (they are lifetime contracts) but the prices for the same plan can vary greatly between insurance companies. You can switch plans and insurance companies anytime If you can pass medical underwriting.

In several states (CA, NV, ID, OR, and IL), the Medigap Birthday Rule is in effect, which allows you to switch, without underwriting, to another supplemental plan with the same or lesser benefits. MO has an Anniversary Rule, while ME has Open Enrollment every June.  Other states (MA, NY, WA, and CT) make it even easier to switch plans.

===Medicare Advantage===
If you are in Medicare Advantage, Part C coverage, which is replacing Parts A, B in Original Medicare and is usually including prescription coverage (instead of Part D separately) then you need to be aware that you have an annual contract with an insurance company for those benefits.&lt;ref name="nvboglehead" /&gt;

These contracts can change greatly from year to year, so you would be wise to not just blindly renew with the same insurance company. Your provider network might soon be very different and your co-pays could change. Your prescription drug coverage may also change. You can switch to a better Advantage plan in the open enrollment period in the fall for coverage starting in the new year.&lt;ref name="nvboglehead" /&gt;

You can easily shop Medicare Advantage and Medicare D plans on the medicare.gov website.&lt;ref name="nvboglehead" /&gt;

===Supplemental plans (Medigap)===
Each insurance company decides how it will set the price, except for certain states where the Medicare Supplement pricing methodology is mandated by the state. The way they set the price affects how much you pay now and in the future. Medigap policies can be priced or "rated" in 3 ways:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Costs of Medigap policies|url=https://www.medicare.gov/supplements-other-insurance/whats-medicare-supplement-insurance-medigap/medigap-costs/costs-of-medigap-policies|access-date=April 4, 2022|website=Medicare.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#Community-rated (also called "no age-rated"): The same monthly premium is charged to everyone who has the Medigap policy, regardless of age.
#Issue-age-rated (also called "entry age-rated"): The premium is based on the age you are when you buy (when you're "issued") the Medigap policy.
#Attained-age-rated: The premium is based on your current age (the age you have "attained"), so your premium goes up as you get older.

See [https://www.medicare.gov/supplements-other-insurance/whats-medicare-supplement-insurance-medigap/medigap-costs/costs-of-medigap-policies Costs of Medigap policies] for the details, including how to shop for a Medigap policy.

==== Considerations for high-deductible Medigap plans ====
One of the most misunderstood, and unfortunately  misnamed, parts of the Medicare program are the high-deductible Medicare Supplement (Medigap) plans, the high-deductible versions of Plans F and G.  These plans should be considered particularly by individuals in good heath when joining Medicare, depending on if the pricing of these Plans compared to other Medigap plans are relatively attractive in an individual’s locale.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Forum post|p=6607328|title=Re: Wiki - Medicare article overhaul|author=ModifiedDuration|date=April 7, 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The major misconception concerns the fact that a high-deductible Medigap plan does not have a first-dollar deductible, like most health care plans. &lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

With a high-deductible Medigap plan, Medicare Part B first pays 80% of Medicare-approved expenses (at the low Medicare reimbursement rate) and the “deductible” in a high-deductible Medigap plan is actually just the Part B 20% coinsurance until the “deductible” is reached for the high-deductible Medigap plan.  (One caveat is that the entire cost of the Part A deductible when a hospital inpatient would be borne with a high-deductible Medigap Plan, until the Plan deductible is met.)&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

So, when a Part B bill is received, an individual is just paying 20% of the bill until the “deductible” is reached, unlike what occurs in most healthcare plans, where the individual is paying 100% of the bill until the deductible is reached.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Many individuals have found that once they understand how high-deductible Medigap plans work and once they review various projected healthcare expense scenarios going forward, a high-deductible Medigap plan could result in significant financial savings over a lifetime.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

===Medical insurance brokers===
Many people have found it very useful to work with an insurance brokers who specialize in Medicare.  A knowledgeable agent can guide you to what are the most appropriate choices for your specific circumstances.  A good Medicare insurance broker would be knowledgeable about your specific market, the options available, the price increase histories, and the best insurance companies, as well as the insurance companies to stay away from.  There is no cost to you, as their commission is paid by the insurance company.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Forum post|p=6607020|title=Re: Wiki - Medicare article overhaul|author=ModifiedDuration|date=April 06, 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Be sure to find a reputable agent, as some agents steer people to Medicare Advantage plans because of their high commissions.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

===Retiree considerations===
A number of companies, as part of their retirement package, include subsidizing your supplemental plans.  Many of those will only reimburse you on what you spend (up to a cap in many cases).  If you are in this situation, selecting a Medicare Advantage plan that has a no or low monthly cost, when buying  a Medigap plan that could be paid in full with your company's subsidy, needs to be part of the evaluation process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Forum post|p=6604106|title=Re: Wiki - Medicare article overhaul|author=CRC_Volunteer|date=April 05, 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''{{PAGENAME}}''', often abbreviated as '''IRMAA''', is a surcharge added to monthly Medicare Part B and Part D premiums, for Medicare recipients based on their annual income.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.healthline.com/health/medicare/what-is-irmaa|title=What Is an IRMAA in Medicare?|publisher=healthline|date=May 29, 2020|access-date=April 5, 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt; In effect, IRMAA reduces the subsidy that high-income beneficiaries receive from Medicare. Although not described as a tax, it can behave as a tax-like cost for retired Medicare recipients, increasing the [[Marginal tax rate|marginal tax rate]] on retirement income, such as withdrawals from pre-tax [[401k]]s and [[Traditional IRA|IRAs]]. For simplicity, IRMAA surcharges are included with income taxes in marginal tax rate calculations except where explicitly separated. This page describes IRMAA, situations when it does and doesn't apply, and strategies for minimizing its cost in conjunction with taxes.  

About 5.0 million Medicare beneficiaries, about 10% of total, are affected by IRMAA. In 2021, IRMAA generated $11.2B of revenue for Medicare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cms.gov/files/document/2021-medicare-trustees-report.pdf|title=2021 Annual Report of the Boards of Trustees of the Federal Hospital Insurance and Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Funds|publisher=Medicare Boards of Trustees|date=August 31, 2021|access-date=April 13, 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Calculation==

For a given year, IRMAA surcharges are based on the Medicare recipient's [[Modified_Adjusted_Gross_Income#MAGI_for_Medicare_premiums_.28IRMAA_tiers.29|Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI)]] ''two years prior''. For example, IRMAA for 2024 Medicare premiums is based on MAGI in 2022. Medicare recipients will receive an initial IRMAA determination from the Social Security Administration (SSA)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.medicare.gov/forms-help-other-resources/mail-you-get-about-medicare/initial-irmaa-determination|title=Initial IRMAA Determination|publisher=medicare.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; based on tax data automatically supplied to the SSA by the IRS, and a determination will be reissued each year if warranted by income. The brackets are adjusted for inflation each year (rounded to the nearest $1,000). For joint filers, the bracket numbers are twice the bracket numbers for single filers (with the exception of the top bracket which is 1.5 times the top single bracket). The IRMAA tiers for single, Married Filing Jointly (MFJ), and Married Filing Separately (MFS) Medicare recipients in 2024 are listed in Tables 1, 2, and 3 below. The single IRMAA tiers also apply to Head of Household and Qualified Widow(er) with Dependent Child.

The IRMAA tiers do not behave the same way as the [[Progressive_tax|tax brackets]] for income tax most taxpayers are familiar with. IRMAA surcharges kick in abruptly once an IRMAA tier boundary is crossed, and so create a [[Marginal_tax_rate#Spikes_in_marginal_tax_rate|spike]] in the marginal tax rate, when the IRMAA surcharge is included. For taxpayers close to an IRMAA tier boundary, this means that the marginal tax rate on a change in income can be very large. This also means that changes in income that do not cross an IRMAA tier boundary have an IRMAA marginal tax rate of zero.

Note that you’re required to pay the Part D IRMAA, even if your employer or a third party (like a teacher’s union or a retirement system) pays for your Part D plan premiums. If you don’t pay the Part D IRMAA and get disenrolled, you may also lose your retirement coverage and you may not be able to get it back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medicare.gov/drug-coverage-part-d/costs-for-medicare-drug-coverage/monthly-premium-for-drug-plans|title=Monthly premium for drug plans|publisher=Medicare.gov|access-date=April 14, 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also note that IRMAA nullifies any [https://blog.ssa.gov/how-the-hold-harmless-provision-protects-your-benefits/ hold harmless] benefit you have accumulated. If you have not been subject to IRMAA for many years, your Part B premium might be lower than the standard amount (currently $202.90) because the hold harmless provision constrained its growth to that of your Social Security COLA. But a single year of IRMAA undoes that, and your Part B premium resets to the standard amount.

==Managing IRMAA Costs==

IRMAA surcharges should be managed in conjunction with other taxes. For taxpayers who have some control over their taxable income, the best approach is usually to set taxable income slightly below the top of one of the IRMAA tiers. Some IRMAA cost management approaches require planning, so future Medicare recipients should begin planning for the effects of IRMAA around age 60, or possibly even younger.

An additional challenge with IRMAA planning comes from the two-year delay in IRMAA costs. A taxpayer in a given year trying to decide how much taxable income to generate (for example, by selling appreciated assets or Roth conversions) will have to guess what the IRMAA tier thresholds will be in two years, which depends on the inflation rate during that time span. If inflation is lower than expected, the taxpayer could cross into the next higher tier and pay an extra spike in IRMAA costs. Alternatively, assuming no inflation could deprive the taxpayer of valuable income space. IRMAA tables for a given year are published in October or November of the year prior, so a taxpayer trying to precisely predict IRMAA thresholds could at least wait until after they are released for the following year, so at least data for one of the two years is available. It is also possible for IRMAA tier dollar amounts to decrease in a period of deflation.

To illustrate this challenge, note that numerical examples here use the 2026 tiers, based on 2024 income, but it is likely (e.g., see [https://thefinancebuff.com/medicare-irmaa-income-brackets.html 2025 2026 2027 Medicare Part B IRMAA Premium MAGI Brackets]) that 2027 IRMAA tiers, based on 2025 income, will have higher breakpoints due to inflation.

===Example: Spreading out withdrawals===

A 75-year-old single taxpayer has a baseline taxable income of $80,000, comprised of Social Security benefits and [[Required Minimum Distribution|Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs)]] from a [[Traditional IRA|traditional IRA]]. She wants to make an additional IRA withdrawal of $50,000 for a purchase next year. Withdrawing $50,000 either this year or next year would trigger a $1148.40 IRMAA surcharge, which would add about 2.29% marginal tax rate to the withdrawal. Instead, if she withdraws $25,000 each this year and next, her MAGI can be kept below the IRMAA threshold and IRMAA can be avoided. In addition, depending on her deductions and the tax brackets next year, she may have more income taxed in the 22% bracket and less in the 24% bracket. Spreading out the withdrawals over two years is clearly a better strategy.

===Example: Concentrating withdrawals===

A 75-year-old single taxpayer has a baseline taxable income of $130,000, comprised of Social Security benefits and [[Required Minimum Distribution|Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs)]] from a [[Traditional IRA|traditional IRA]]. She wants to make an additional IRA withdrawal of $30,000 for a purchase next year. Withdrawing $30,000 either this year or next year would trigger a $1,736.40 IRMAA surcharge, which would add about 5.77% marginal tax rate to the withdrawal. But if she instead withdraws $15,000 each this year and next, she will face the same IRMAA surcharge in both years, doubling the marginal tax rate on the withdrawal to 9.46%. Both withdrawals would be entirely in the 24% income tax bracket, so there is no difference in income taxes. Concentrating the withdrawal in a single year is the better strategy. 

===Example: Traditional or Roth contributions===

A 60-year-old married taxpayer is choosing between [[Traditional versus Roth|traditional or Roth]] contributions. His current marginal tax rate is 24%, and he has a large [[Traditional IRA|traditional IRA]] and expects [[Required Minimum Distribution|Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs)]] of roughly $250,000/year to begin at age 75. The future marginal income tax rate will also be 24%, suggesting that traditional and Roth contributions will be equally valuable. However, this taxpayer will likely already be in the first IRMAA tier, and with additional traditional contributions will risk crossing into the second tier and facing an annual cost increase of $3,472.80. Although it's possible he will stay in the same IRMAA tier regardless of what contributions he makes, there is no offsetting risk for Roth contributions, which are therefore the better choice.

===Example: Roth conversions===

71-year-old married taxpayers with no baseline taxable income want to make [[Roth IRA conversion|Roth conversions]]. They expect a marginal tax rate of 24% in four years when RMDs begin. They may face IRMAA after age 75, but can begin by assuming conversions now are unlikely to change their IRMAA tier. Ignoring IRMAA today, they could convert up to $429,200 at a marginal tax rate of 24% or less ($394,400 top of the 24% bracket plus $34,800 standard deduction). However, that amount of taxable income will trigger several IRMAA tiers. Each tier should be evaluated separately. At a minimum, converting up to just under the $218,000 IRMAA tier boundary goes up to the 22% income tax bracket and triggers no IRMAA surcharges, so would be beneficial. Each possible conversion beyond $218,000 must be evaluated separately:

Note: the data below is still from 2024; it needs to be re-worked, and the spreadsheet must take into account the increased standard deduction for seniors (phases out from $150K-250K, adding 1.32% to the marginal tax rate)

* Converting an additional $27,450, up to the top of the 22% bracket, generates $6,039 in additional income tax and $1,874.40 of IRMAA surcharges, for a total cost of $7,913.40 and a marginal tax rate of '''28.83%'''.
* Instead, converting an additional $52,000, up to just under the $246,000 IRMAA tier boundary, generates $11,931 in additional income tax and $1,874.40 of IRMAA surcharges, for a total cost of $13,805.40 and a marginal tax rate of '''26.55%'''.
* Instead, converting an additional $112,000, up to just under the $306,000 IRMAA tier boundary, generates $26,331 in additional income tax and $4,711.20 of IRMAA surcharges, for a total cost of $31,042.20 and a marginal tax rate of '''27.72%'''.
* Instead, converting an additional $172,000, up to just under the $366,000 IRMAA tier boundary, generates $40,731 in additional income tax and $7,545.60 of IRMAA surcharges, for a total cost of $48,276.60 and a marginal tax rate of '''28.07%'''.
* Instead, converting an additional $200,900, up to the top of the 24% income tax bracket, generates $47,667 in additional income tax and $10,382.40 of IRMAA surcharges, for a total cost of $58,049.40 and a marginal tax rate of '''28.89%'''.

In summary, no amount of Roth conversions above $194,000 will incur a marginal tax rate less than or equal to 24%. So, despite having $394,900 "room" to convert up to the top of the 24% bracket, this taxpayer is able to use less than half of that room due to IRMAA surcharges. Investors should also note that Roth conversions at age 62 and younger are not subject to IRMAA; Roth conversions starting at age 63 will be included in MAGI used to calculate IRMAA once Medicare starts at age 65.

The above analysis assumed that conversions will not change future IRMAA rates, which may or may not be correct. If this taxpayer expected, with confidence, that future taxable income would fall just above an IRMAA tier threshold, then the future IRMAA surcharge savings should be included in estimates of future marginal tax rates, and conversions today above 24% would be economically beneficial. Unfortunately, predicting future account balances this precisely even four years ahead is difficult, especially if they contain volatile assets like stocks. As an alternative approach, this taxpayer could pick a range of potential future RMDs (say, $200,000-$300,000), look up the rough average IRMAA rate over this range (approximately 5%), and assume this rate is applied uniformly over future income. With an assumed net withdrawal tax rate of 29% (24% income tax + 5% IRMAA), all of the above possible conversions become very slightly economically beneficial, by up to a few percent. In reality, the actual IRMAA rate at withdrawal will either be much larger than 5%, or zero, but this can only be known in hindsight. 

As should be apparent, the "spike" or "cliff" behavior of IRMAA can make planning very difficult. Taxpayers who may be affected by IRMAA need to make reasonable assumptions, make the easy planning decisions that are very likely to be beneficial, and to not worry too much about getting the close calls exactly right. For close calls, other factors such as whether likely heirs would benefit more from inheriting pre-tax or Roth assets may dominate the decision. In practice, differences in tax rates of a few percent are unlikely to make any meaningful difference in any of these example taxpayers' financial lives.

Another example of a difficult IRMAA planning situation can be found elsewhere on the wiki: [[Traditional_versus_Roth_examples#Worth_pushing_through_the_Social_Security_hump_and.2For_IRMAA_cliffs.3F|Traditional vs. Roth Examples: Worth pushing through the Social Security hump and/or IRMAA cliffs?]]

==Taxation==

Medicare premiums, including any IRMAA surcharges, are only tax-deductible in certain situations:

* Taxpayers who itemize deductions may deduct Medicare premiums on [https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-schedule-a-form-1040 Form 1040 Schedule A] along with all other qualifying medical expenses for the tax year. However, this deduction is subject to a 7.5% AGI floor, and many retirees do not itemize their deductions to begin with.
* Self-employed taxpayers may deduct Medicare premiums above-the-line on [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1040s1.pdf Form 1040 Schedule 1] as self-employed health insurance premiums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.medicareresources.org/faqs/can-i-deduct-my-medicare-premiums-on-my-tax-return/|title=Can I deduct my Medicare premiums on my tax return?|publisher=medicareresources.org|date=January 3, 2022|access-date=April 14, 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deduction is limited to the net business income.

Note that the federal withholding percentage for Social Security payments is applied '''after''' the deduction for Medicare premiums, including IRMAA.

==Exceptions for IRMAA==

The SSA may grant appeals to an IRMAA determination if a taxpayer has a qualifying '''life-changing event'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://yourmedicare.com/how-do-i-submit-an-appeal-for-my-irmaa-decision/|title=How do I Submit an Appeal for my IRMAA Decision?|publisher=yourmedicare}}&lt;/ref&gt;:

* The death of a spouse
* Marriage
* Divorce or annulment of your marriage
* You or your spouse stops working or reduces the number of hours you work
* Involuntary loss of income-producing property due to a disaster, disease, fraud, or other circumstances
* Loss of pension
* Receipt of a settlement payment from a current or former employer due to the employer’s closure or bankruptcy

Details are provided in [https://www.hhs.gov/about/agencies/omha/the-appeals-process/part-b-premium-appeals/index.html Medicare Part B Premium Appeals]. Social Security Administration [https://medicareportal.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/irmaa-appeal-form.pdf Form SSA-44] is used for life-changing events. In addition, the SSA may also grant IRMAA appeals when a prior tax return is amended, or when an error has been made. 

Single-year increases in taxable income not from a qualifying life-changing event are '''not''' grounds for an IRMAA appeal. Examples of one-time taxable income not exempt from IRMAA include:

* Selling appreciated stock or other assets
* [[Roth IRA conversions|Roth conversions]]
* Selling the family home (to the extent the gains are not excluded by the [[Owning_vs_renting#Taxation|capital gains exclusion]] of $250,000 for singles or $500,000 for married couples) or rental property
* Cashing out an annuity or life insurance contract worth more than the cost basis

Taxpayers considering generating taxable income should include any IRMAA surcharges as part of the tax cost of the transaction, albeit two years in the future.

One of the basic '''HSA''' ([[Health savings account|Health Savings Account]]) qualifying rules is: "You have no other health coverage (except for dental, vision, and other specific exceptions)." This rule has been an issue for those receiving health care benefits from the Department of Veterans Affairs (also known as the "VA"). Congress, the IRS, and the Department of Veterans Affairs have cooperated over time to resolve some of the complexity of having a [[High deductible health plan]] / [[Health savings account]] and VA Health Care.

== History and legislation ==
Originally, if you received medical care from the VA, it was treated as disqualifying coverage. This has evolved over time.

=== Internal Revenue Bulletin: 2004-33, Notice 2004-50, Q&amp;A 5:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=IRS|url= https://www.irs.gov/irb/2004-33_IRB/ar08.html|date=June 9, 2021|title=Internal Revenue Bulletin: 2004-33}}&lt;/ref&gt; ===

Q-5.  If an otherwise eligible individual under section 223(c)(1) is eligible for medical benefits through the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), may he or she contribute to an HSA? 

A-5.  An otherwise eligible individual who is eligible to receive VA medical benefits, but who has not actually received such benefits during the preceding three months**, is an eligible individual under section 223(c)(1). An individual is not eligible to make HSA contributions for any month, however, if the individual has received medical benefits from the VA at any time during the previous three months**.

=== IRS Notice 2008-59, Q&amp;A-9:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=IRS|url=https://www.irs.gov/irb/2008-29_IRB/ar11.html|date=June 9, 2021|title=IRS Notice 2008-59}}&lt;/ref&gt; ===
Q-9. Is an individual an eligible individual if he or she is eligible for medical benefits through the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) but only receives medical care that is disregarded coverage or preventive care from the VA and is otherwise an eligible individual?

A-9. Yes. Although an individual actually receiving medical benefits from the VA at any time in the previous three months** is generally not an eligible individual, this rule does not apply if the medical benefits consist solely of disregarded coverage or preventive care.

=== H.R. 3236 - Surface Transportation and Veterans Health Care Choice Improvement Act of 2015, Title IV, Section 4007:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Congress|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/3236|date=June 9, 2021|title=H.R. 3236}}&lt;/ref&gt; === 

"(Sec. 4007) Amends the Internal Revenue Code to...treat a veteran receiving hospital care or medical services for a service-connected disability as not disqualified from participating in or contributing to a tax-preferred health savings account."

=== IRS Notice 2015-87, Q&amp;A 20:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=IRS|url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-15-87.pdf|date=June 9, 2021|title=IRS Notice 2015-87}}&lt;/ref&gt; ===

Question 20: ... How does § 4007(b) of the Surface Transportation Act affect the prior guidance on the interaction of the receipt of VA health care and eligibility to contribute to an HSA?

Answer 20: ... Consequently, as a rule of administrative simplification, for purposes of this rule, any hospital care or medical services received from the VA by a veteran who has a disability rating from the VA may be considered to be hospital care or medical services under a law administered by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs for service-connected disability.

== Implications for veterans ==

=== Veterans with a service-connected disability === 
VA healthcare benefits can be used without any restrictions on making HSA contributions. VA is required, by law, to bill private health insurance providers for medical care, supplies and prescriptions provided for treatment of Veterans’ nonservice-connected conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Veterans Affairs|url=https://www.va.gov/healthbenefits/resources/publications/hbco/hbco_va_other_insurance.asp|date=June 9, 2021|title=Veterans Affairs Other Insurance}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This means a veteran can use their VA healthcare benefit for all healthcare and the VA will bill the private insurance HDHP. The HDHP will then apply these costs to the veteran's deductible and out of pocket costs. Any costs the insurance says are the member's responsibility; the VA will waive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Veterans Affairs|url=https://www.va.gov/health-care/about-va-health-benefits/va-health-care-and-other-insurance/|date=June 11, 2021|title=VA health care and other insurance}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This can be beneficial for the veteran if they or their family members on the HDHP plan need to obtain care using the private insurance, because the VA care effectively acts as a reduction in the deductible without any out-of-pocket costs. The veteran might still be responsible for VA copays depending on their VA Priority Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Veterans Affairs|url=https://www.va.gov/health-care/eligibility/priority-groups/|date=June 9, 2021|title=VA priority groups}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CHAMPVA is a program to provide health insurance for the spouse, dependent or survivor of a Veterans that meets certain service-connected disability requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=|title=CHAMPVA benefits|url=https://www.va.gov/family-and-caregiver-benefits/health-and-disability/champva/#eligibility-for-champva|url-status=live|access-date=November 30, 2025|website=VA.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; The HSA implications are that anyone that is eligible for CHAMPVA will be considered to have other health insurance and therefore not eligible for HSA contributions.  The one work around in this situation is that if the Veteran is still alive, they themselves are not eligible for CHAMPVA unless their spouse is also a qualifying veteran which causes them to qualify for CHAMPVA. Therefore, the Veteran spouse would be eligible to make HSA contributions as they would fall in the Veterans with a service-connected disability category above, and VA Healthcare would not disqualify them.

=== Veterans without a service-connected disability ===
VA healthcare can be used for preventative healthcare without impacting the HSA eligibility. If VA healthcare is used for care other than preventative, then HSA contributions are subject to the 3-month rule.

One work around for the lack of HSA eligibility for the veteran, is if they are married, their spouse's eligibility for an HSA is not impacted by this test. Therefore, their spouse could make a full family HSA contribution.

One issue would be is if the veteran's (who is receiving healthcare from the VA) employer provides free money into the HSA, they might need to decline the employer money.

== Complications ==
Due to VA health care benefits for disabled veterans being a very small subset of the population, most HR/benefits offices do not understand this exception to the general rule for service-connected veterans. Most of the time, it is up to the employee to certify they are eligible to have an HSA when they have selected an HDHP, and most lists do not include this scenario as one that is allowed.

{{for|additional information|wikipedia:Health savings account}}

A '''{{PAGENAME}} (HSA)''' is a special account which is used in conjunction with a [[High deductible health plan | high deductible health plan]]. Unlike a [[Flexible spending arrangement  | flexible spending account]], unused money remains in the account and can be invested; most accounts offer either [[mutual fund]]s or brokerage accounts for investing. 

HSAs are often referred to as "triple-tax advantaged", a feature that makes them unique among all investment accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/19/business/health-savings-accounts-tax-break.html|title=The Triple Tax Break You May Be Missing: A Health Savings Account|publisher=The New York Times|date=March 19, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contributions are tax-deductible on federal and most state tax returns; earnings and withdrawals are also tax-free if used for medical expenses. After age 65, you can use HSAs for non-medical purposes, with these withdrawals taxed like a traditional IRA. For this reason, investors should usually contribute to an HSA [[#Contribution_priority_compared_to_other_accounts|before]] making [[Employer matching contributions|unmatched]] retirement account contributions.

You must be covered by a [[high deductible health plan]] to make HSA contributions. Unlike most health insurance, the high deductible plan pays nothing except for preventive care until you meet a fairly high deductible. Determine if this type of plan is appropriate for your personal circumstances and health care needs. If it is, then using the HSA as an investment account can be advantageous.

==How an HSA works==

[https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p969.pdf IRS Publication 969] contains the details of how HSAs work.

===Basics===

You are eligible to contribute to an HSA if you meet the following requirements:
*You are covered under a [[high deductible health plan]], or (starting in 2026) any Catastrophic or Bronze plan from the Affordable Care Act marketplace.
*You have no other health coverage, except for dental, vision, and other specific exceptions
*Neither you '''nor your spouse''' participates in a general purpose [[Flexible spending arrangement|Flexible Spending Account (FSA)]] (because an FSA can be used to reimburse a spouse's medical expenses)
*You are not enrolled in [[Medicare]]
*You are not eligible to be claimed as a dependent on someone else’s tax return

You may withdraw from the HSA tax-free to reimburse qualified medical expenses, even if you are no longer eligible to contribute. Notably, there is no time limit for how long you can wait to withdraw money to reimburse yourself for the expense. This feature allows a [[#Maxing_out_retirement_accounts|strategy]] where you can save receipts for eligible expenses for years or decades, while letting the HSA grow tax-deferred. You can then withdraw from the HSA tax-free later in life for past medical expenses and retirement medical expenses.

You pay tax on withdrawals for other purposes as ordinary income, with an extra 20% penalty. The penalty is waived if you are at least 65 or disabled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p969.pdf|title=Publication 969, Health Savings Accounts and Other Tax-Favored Health Plans|publisher=IRS|accessdate=June 25, 2024|page=10|quote=Additional Tax ... Exceptions. There is no additional tax on distributions made after the date you are disabled, reach age 65, or die.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because withdrawals after age 65 are taxable but penalty-free, the account can also behave like a [[traditional IRA]] when used this way. Because these features allow additional tax-advantaged retirement savings, HSAs are sometimes referred to as "Stealth IRAs".

===Contribution limits===

The 2025 annual limit is $4,400 for an individual plan, or $8,750 for a family plan&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/rp-25-19.pdf|title=IRS Revenue Procedure 2025-19|publisher=IRS|accessdate=27 November 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt; (defined as covering an eligible individual plus at least one other individual), plus $1,000 catch-up contributions if you are at least 55. Contribution limits include both contributions from the HSA participant as well as employer contributions, which are not included in your taxable income.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|format=pdf|url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p969.pdf|title=Publication 969, Health Savings Accounts and Other Tax-Favored Health Plans|publisher=IRS|accessdate=June 25, 2024|page=7|quote=Reporting Contributions on Your Return. Contributions made by your employer aren't included in your income. Contributions to an employee's account by an employer using the amount of an employee's salary reduction through a cafeteria plan are treated as employer contributions. Generally, you can claim contributions you made and contributions made by any other person, other than your employer, on your behalf, as an adjustment to income.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning with the first month you are enrolled in Medicare, your contribution limit is zero.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|format=pdf|url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p969.pdf|title=Publication 969, Health Savings Accounts and Other Tax-Favored Health Plans|publisher=IRS|accessdate=June 25, 2024|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contributions for a family plan only get one $1,000 catch-up even if both spouses are age 55+. This limitation can be circumvented by the other spouse opening up an HSA in their name and contributing $1,000 (or more, as long as the total contributions for both spouses do not exceed the family plan limit plus two catch-ups). HSA contributions have no minimum or maximum income, and these contributions will reduce taxable income on a Married Filing Jointly tax return even if the other spouse has no income. HSAs are always individually-titled accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Forum post|t=411068|title=HSA catch-up contributions for couple (both 55+)|date=August 19, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If you are enrolled in an HDHP for only part of the year, the maximum contribution amount varies based on several factors. The '''last-month rule''' lets you contribute the full annual contribution for a tax year if you are eligible to contribute on December 1st of that year, as long as you remain eligible to contribute through December 31st of the ''following'' year. The last-month rule also lets you contribute the family limit for the year if you have family HDHP coverage on December 1st, even if you only had individual coverage earlier in the year. For more complicated situations involving part-year coverage and/or changing between individual and family coverage, the annual limit is prorated by month;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://livelyme.com/blog/hsa-contribution-limits-mid-year-changes|title=Mid-year HSA Changes: How Status Affects Annual Contribution Limits|format=|page=|publisher=Lively Inc.|accessdate=June 26, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt; see [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p969.pdf IRS Publication 969] for specifics.

If you or your spouse have a general-purpose healthcare FSA, you are both ineligible to contribute to an HSA. However, a [[Flexible_spending_arrangement#Limited-purpose_FSA|limited-purpose FSA]], such as a Dependent Care FSA, does not disqualify anyone from contributing to an HSA.

A non-dependent child who is still covered only by a parent's HDHP (in other words, meets the requirements listed under [[#Basics|basic HSA rules]]) may contribute the ''family'' maximum to their own HSA. The child's HSA is completely separate from the parent's HSA.

You have until April 15th of the following year to contribute to your HSA for a given tax year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p969.pdf|title=Publication 969, Health Savings Accounts and Other Tax-Favored Health Plans|publisher=IRS|accessdate=June 25, 2024|page=8|quote=When To Contribute: You can make contributions to your HSA for 2023 through April 15, 2024. If you fail to be an eligible individual during 2023, you can still make contributions through April 15, 2024, for the months you were an eligible individual.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tax considerations===

Unlike many other tax deductions, there are no income restrictions to contribute to an HSA. Contributions to an HSA reduce your federal adjusted gross income (AGI) dollar for dollar, possibly making you eligible for income-based credits or [[Roth IRA]] contributions you would not otherwise be eligible for without the HSA deduction.

If your employer allows it, you can make your own contributions through pre-tax [[payroll deduction]]; this has the potential advantage that these contributions, like pre-tax insurance premiums, are not subject to [[Social Security]] and Medicare taxes (collectively known as [[Payroll - FICA tax deductions|payroll or FICA taxes]]), so long as the plan is classified as a Section 125 or "cafeteria" plan. If you are below the Social Security Wage Base, the reduction in Social Security taxes may reduce your future Social Security benefits. The [[Social Security as an investment|benefit or drawback of saving Social Security tax]] depends on your lifetime earning record. Generally, high earners come out ahead by avoiding FICA taxes, low earners come out behind, and middle earners come close to breaking even. See: [[Social Security as an investment]] and [[#Contribution_priority_compared_to_other_accounts|below]]. 

===State taxation of HSAs===

While contributions are deductible on your federal income tax, this is not always true for [[State income taxes|state income tax]]. The following states do not conform to federal legislation and do not recognize HSAs, so contributions are not deductible and earnings are taxable:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hsaforamerica.com/state-income-tax.htm|title=HSA State Income Tax|publisher=HSA For America}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*California
*New Jersey 

If you live in one of these states you must treat the HSA as a [[taxable account]] for state tax purposes, and keep track of [[Specific identification of shares|tax lots]], dividends, capital gains, distributions, and so on within the account. The IRS does not require HSA administrators to send you tax forms (such as 1099-INT or 1099-B), so you have to keep good records, track the state cost basis manually, and report any HSA investment income on your state tax return. If you live in one of these states, consider keeping your HSA investments especially simple to limit the work involved in this non-trivial task. 

You may be able to include amounts paid for medical expenses as an itemized deduction on the state tax return, subject to AGI floors, but only in the year you incurred the expense.

If you live in one of these states, consider investing the HSA in [[Treasury bonds]] or [[TIPS]], which are exempt from state taxes. (In California, you would pay state tax on capital gains issued by a TIPS/Treasury mutual fund or capital gain/loss on the sale of Treasury mutual fund shares, but even if you do, most of the returns from Treasury bonds and TIPS would be income which is not subject to state tax. New Jersey exempts capital gains on Treasuries from state tax.) [[Tax loss harvesting]] may be possible on the state tax return if you have capital gains or the state allows carryovers of capital losses. 

If you move from a state which does not tax HSAs to a state which taxes HSAs, sell any holdings with capital gains before you move, so that you will not pay taxes on the same capital gains when you sell the same holdings later as a resident of the state. You can buy back the same or similar holdings immediately after selling.

In states that tax contributions, be aware that Federal tax-free rollovers into an HSA, such as the once in a lifetime IRA to HSA rollover, and an Archer MSA to HSA rollover, are treated as a non-qualified withdrawal from the IRA/MSA at the state level and subject to income taxes and penalties on the state return. Also in states that tax contributions, the state treats the HSA as a taxable account, so that taxable investing rules apply.

===Withdrawals===

Withdrawals for qualified medical expenses (as outlined in [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p502.pdf IRS Publication 502, Medical and Dental Expenses]) that you, your spouse, and any dependents incur after you establish the HSA are tax-free. These include medical expenses you incur after you are no longer eligible to contribute to the HSA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/irb/2004-33_IRB/ar08.html|title=IRS Notice 2004-33|publisher=IRS|accessdate=June 25, 2024|quote=Question 39: ...}}&lt;/ref&gt; As long as you keep proper records, there is no limit for how long you can wait to reimburse yourself for qualified expenses. Medical expenses from before you established the HSA are ''not'' eligible for tax-free withdrawals, even if you had HDHP coverage and would have been eligible to contribute to an HSA. 

State law determines when an HSA is established. Most state laws require that a trust be funded to be established. This means that in most cases an HSA is not established until your first contribution goes into the HSA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.newfront.com/blog/hsa-establishment-date|title=HSA Establishment Date|publisher=Newfront|accessdate=August 5, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Withdrawals to pay for some types of medical insurance premiums are also tax-free. As detailed in [https://www.irs.gov/irb/2004-02_IRB#NOT-2004-2 Internal Revenue Bulletin 2004-2 (January 12, 2004) - Health Savings Accounts - Q&amp;A 27], you can use HSA funds to pay for qualified long-term care insurance (but only up to IRS specified dollar amounts), COBRA health care continuation coverage, and health care coverage while receiving unemployment compensation.  Furthermore, once reaching age 65, you can pay premiums for Medicare Part A or B, Medicare HMO, and the employee share of premiums for employer-sponsored health insurance (including premiums for employer-sponsored retiree health insurance) from an HSA. Premiums for Medigap policies are '''not''' qualified medical expenses and therefore cannot be paid tax-free from an HSA. 

There was further clarification in [https://www.irs.gov/irb/2008-29_IRB Internal Revenue Bulletin: 2008-29 (July 21, 2008) - Notice 2008-59 - Health Savings Accounts - Q&amp;A-29. Payment of Medicare Part D premiums]. This Q&amp;A clarified that Medicare Part D premiums are eligible expenses. The previous 2004 guidance had came out before Medicare Part D was established in 2006, therefore this guidance provided clarity for Medicare Part D premiums.

===Rollovers/Transfers===

You can move money between HSA custodians through direct rollovers and trustee-to-trustee transfers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p969.pdf|title=Publication 969, Health Savings Accounts and Other Tax-Favored Health Plans|publisher=IRS|accessdate=June 25, 2024|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rules are exactly the same as [[IRA Rollovers and Transfers]]. You may want to do this annually if you contribute to a plan through your employer's payroll deduction to gain the social security and medicare payroll tax exemption, but you do not want to leave the funds there long-term if the investment options are not good. The HSA custodian(s) may charge a fee for a trustee-to-trustee transfer; you can usually rollover directly without a fee.

You can make a once-in-a-lifetime rollover or transfer from an [[IRA]] to an HSA up to the annual HSA contribution limit. This is usually not a good idea, because you then lose the ability to contribute and take an HSA tax deduction for the amount you transfer, but it can be an emergency source of funds without paying taxes or penalties.&lt;ref name="thef_One-"&gt;{{Cite web | title = One-Time Transfer From IRA To HSA: Forget About It | author-link =The Finance Buff| first=Harry | last=Sit  | work = The Finance Buff | date = March 14, 2017 | accessdate = 2017-11-04 | url = https://thefinancebuff.com/one-time-transfer-from-ira-to-hsa-forget-about-it.html | quote =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; See [https://www.irs.gov/irb/2008-25_IRB/ar09.html IRS Notice 2008-51]. You can also roll over an Archer MSA to an HSA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p969.pdf|title=Publication 969, Health Savings Accounts and Other Tax-Favored Health Plans|publisher=IRS|accessdate=June 25, 2024|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; If you live in a [[#State_taxation_of_HSAs|state that taxes HSA contributions]], these rollovers have the additional drawback of incurring state taxes and penalties. 

===Medicare===
{{See also|Medicare#Health savings account|label 1=Medicare}}

Social Security recipients 65 years of age or older are automatically enrolled in [[Medicare]] Part A and therefore ineligible to contribute to a Health Savings Account.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cms.gov/medicare/eligibility-and-enrollment/origmedicarepartabeligenrol/index.html|title=Original Medicare (Part A and B) Eligibility and Enrollment|publisher=Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services|accessdate=28 Aug 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aarp.org/health/medicare-insurance/info-04-2009/ask_ms_medicare_question_53.html|title=Can I Have a Health Savings Account as Well as Medicare?|publisher=AARP|accessdate=28 Aug 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

You must stop contributing to your HSA when you enroll in Medicare. However, you may use money that is already in your HSA after you enroll in Medicare to help pay for deductibles, premiums, copayments, or coinsurance.&lt;ref name="MedicareAndU"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.medicare.gov/pubs/pdf/10050-Medicare-and-You.pdf|title=Medicare and You|publisher=Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Service|accessdate=Nov 13, 2017}}, page 23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IRScontrib"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p969.pdf|title=Publication 969, Health Savings Accounts and Other Tax-Favored Health Plans|publisher=IRS|accessdate=June 25, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Premium-free Part A coverage begins six months back ''from the date you apply for Medicare'' (or Social Security/RRB benefits), but ''no earlier than the first month you were eligible for Medicare''. To avoid a tax penalty, make your last HSA contribution the month before your Part A coverage begins.&lt;ref name="MedicareAndU" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Forum post|p=3616132|title=Re: Medicare &lt;nowiki&gt;[Can I contribute to Health Savings Account?]&lt;/nowiki&gt;|author=Spirit Rider}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If you contribute to your HSA after your Medicare coverage starts, you may have to pay a tax penalty. Generally, you must pay a 6% excise tax on excess contributions. The excise tax applies to ''each tax year'' the excess contribution remains in the account.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p969.pdf|title=Publication 969, Health Savings Accounts and Other Tax-Favored Health Plans|publisher=IRS|accessdate=June 25, 2024|quote=Excess contributions ...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If you expect to have a [[#Overfunded_HSA|much larger HSA balance]] than your medical expenses, give consideration to using Medicare supplement plan G - high deductible. You would save on supplement premiums relative to the regular plan G and could use the HSA to pay deductibles. This would convert an expense that is not HSA-eligible (supplement premium) to an expense that is eligible (meeting deductible for part B services). Other, less generous and cheaper supplement plans might also be worth considering.

===Death of HSA holder===

A spouse beneficiary can inherit an HSA. Any other beneficiary will receive the HSA as a taxable distribution. See the Inherited HSA section [[#Inherited HSA|below]] for more details.

==How the account operates==

Details vary among HSA custodians, but in general you can withdraw no more than your current HSA balance.  This differs from [[Flexible spending arrangement#Distributions from an FSA|FSA distributions]] that allow withdrawals up to your planned contribution amount, even if you have not yet made all those contributions. The custodian may provide you with checks or a debit card to pay medical providers, and you can make online withdrawals from the HSA.

When you file taxes, [https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-8889 Form 8889] is how you tell the IRS how much of those withdrawals were for qualified medical expenses.

Some HSA custodians require you to keep a certain amount of your HSA as cash, while others allow you to invest using the same choices you would have with an IRA at that custodian.

You can choose your custodian, and transfer accounts between different custodians. However, if your health plan or employer makes a contribution, it may select the custodian to which it makes contributions, and may offer other incentives such as waiving service fees.

==How to use the plan==
{{See also|Emergency fund#Health savings account as an emergency fund | label 1=Health savings account as an emergency fund}}

There are two ways to use the HSA. You can either pay all your medical expenses from it, or pay out of pocket and save the plan money for medical expenses in retirement. Even if you use the HSA to pay current expenses, you will likely accumulate more than you spend, and can invest the remainder for medical expenses in retirement.

===Contribution priority compared to other accounts===
{{Main|Prioritizing investments}}

Usually, you should contribute to an [[Employer_retirement_plans_overview|employer retirement plan]] when you get a [[Employer_matching_contributions|match]], and pay off high-interest debts, before contributing to an HSA. But, you should contribute to an HSA before an employer plan when you do not get a match, or an [[IRA]]. The reason is that HSA contributions are tax-deductible, and if your medical expenses are high enough, the withdrawals can be tax-free too. With retirement accounts, either the contributions (pre-tax accounts) or withdrawals (Roth accounts) are tax-free, but not both. In the worst case where you do not have sufficient medical expenses to later withdraw tax-free, withdrawals after age 65 are taxable but penalty-free, so the account behaves similarly to a pre-tax retirement account ([[traditional IRA]], [[401(k)]], and others). 

In addition, HSA contributions via employer [[Payroll_-_cafeteria_plan_deductions#Health_Savings_Account|payroll deduction]] are exempt from [[Payroll_-_FICA_tax_deductions|FICA taxes]], where 401(k) and IRA contributions are not,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.voya.com/voya-insights/undervalued-benefit-hsa-programs-employers-and-employees-may-be-missing-fica-savings|title=The undervalued benefit of HSA programs employers and employees may be missing: FICA savings|publisher=Voya Financial|accessdate=June 26, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc424.html|title=Topic 424 - 401(k) Plans|publisher=IRS|accessdate=June 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this is usually a benefit. Higher-income investors above the second Social Security bend point should expect a [[Social_Security_as_an_investment#Rate_of_return|low or negative rate of return]] on Social Security taxes, so avoiding these taxes is a big benefit. Investors between the first and second bend-points can expect a modest return, and the benefit of avoiding Social Security taxes is not clear. Those below the first bend-point can expect an excellent return on Social Security taxes and should not avoid them. But, you can choose to pay FICA taxes on HSA contributions by contributing directly to the custodian, rather than via employer payroll deduction. 

You will also see a benefit in avoiding payroll tax if it will not affect your future Social Security benefits, such as when:

*You will not accrue 40 work credits (equivalent to ten years) necessary to qualify for Social Security benefits
*The current year will not be one of your top 35 earning years (adjusted for inflation)
*You expect to collect Social Security benefits based on someone else's earnings record
*Your earned income this year will be higher than the Social Security Wage Base ($168,600 as of 2024), which saves Medicare taxes only

See [[Social Security as an investment]] for more details.

===During working years===

During your working years, the choice of withdrawing from an HSA to pay for medical expenses, or paying them out-of-pocket, comes down to what you would otherwise do with the money. If withdrawing from the HSA means you can contribute more money into retirement accounts, that is the better choice. If you can afford to pay out-of-pocket for the medical expenses and would otherwise invest the money in a [[taxable account]], it is probably better to pay out-of-pocket, although there are exceptions.

====Maxing out retirement accounts====

If you are maxing out your retirement accounts, you should probably pay for current medical expenses out-of-pocket and leave the money in the HSA. This strategy treats the HSA as an opportunity for further retirement savings, like an IRA, with the plan to not withdraw from it until you retire. If you have $1,000 in medical bills, paying them out-of-pocket leaves the $1,000 in the HSA to grow tax-deferred or tax-free, and keeps the right to withdraw $1,000 tax-free in a future year (if you save records appropriately). If you pay the expense from the HSA, you will have an extra $1,000 to invest in your [[taxable account]], which will grow more slowly due to [[Taxable_account#Taxable_account_investing_strategy|tax drag]].

The biggest advantage of leaving the money in the HSA comes from the possibility that medical expenses will allow the ''growth'' on the money to also be tax-free. This can happen due to future medical expenses (including [[Medicare]] premiums), or if you have so many other past medical expenses that the HSA balance is unlikely to ever exceed them. In this case, future growth and withdrawals will be tax-free, similar to a Roth account. 

However, if you expect your HSA balance to be so large (and/or your medical expenses to be so small) that you will have to take taxable withdrawals, there may be better strategies. See: [[#Overfunded_HSA|Overfunded HSA]] below.

====Not maxing retirement accounts====

If you are not maxing out your retirement accounts, you should pay current expenses from the HSA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Forum post|t=150572|title=Confused by Wiki Advice on HSA Spending|date=10 Nov 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; If you are in a 24% tax bracket and have $1,000 in medical bills, taking $1,000 from the HSA to pay the bill means you can invest an extra $1,000 in your [[Roth IRA]] or $1,316 in your [[401(k)]], either of which will be as good or better than leaving it in the HSA.

If you keep the $1,000 in the HSA and pay the expense out-of-pocket, you will have the right to withdraw $1,000 tax-free from the HSA later, but the growth on the $1,000 might be tax-free or taxable depending on your medical expenses. The right to withdraw the $1,000 tax-free could even be lost if you leave the HSA to a non-spouse, or if you lose the receipts. But if you pay the expense out of the HSA and invest the $1,000 in a Roth IRA, your future gains will always be tax-free to you and your heirs, and your heirs get an additional [[Stretch IRA|ten-year stretch]]. If you invested $1,316 in a 401(k), that is just as good after adjusting for the presumed 24% tax you will pay in retirement.

===Withdrawing in retirement===
{{Main|Retirement draw-down priority}}

After you retire, you can withdraw from the HSA an amount equal to your past medical expenses plus any current expenses tax-free, and withdraw from your other accounts for non-medical expenses. HSAs can be used to pay medicare premiums and other medical expenses in retirement. If you are too healthy in retirement and cannot use the HSA for medical expenses (even past ones), the non-medical portion is still as good as a [[traditional IRA]] once you are age 65.

====Tax-free withdrawals====

If you need cash for spending and are choosing between withdrawals from an HSA and a Roth account, withdraw from the HSA tax-free (based on past and current medical expenses) before withdrawing from Roth accounts. Withdrawing tax-free from an HSA will almost always be better, and never worse, than withdrawing from a Roth account,&lt;ref&gt;{{Forum post|p=1973176|title=HSA as stealth IRA - Inheritance issue|date=25 Feb 2014|quote=Those with both Roth IRA accounts and HSA accounts with unreimbursed qualified medical expenses, should distribute those tax-free HSA dollars before touching the Roth accounts. Also, upon turning 65 they should make distributions for Medicare Part B premiums, and other qualified medical expenses (co-pay, co-insurance, dental, vision. etc...). Tax-free HSA dollars should always be spent before Roth dollars.}}&lt;/ref&gt; because: 

#Foregone future growth on the HSA money may or may not be tax-free, whereas growth on the Roth money will always be tax-free (as long as you meet the basic [[Roth_IRA#Treatment_of_distributions|distribution requirements]]) with the additional benefit of a [[Stretch_IRA|ten-year stretch]].
#It is possible that the HSA money might later become taxable if you wait to withdraw (if receipts get lost, someone forgets to make a qualified withdrawal, or the account is [[Health_savings_account#Non-spouse_beneficiary|left to a non-spouse]]).
#It eliminates the need to keep receipts for those expenses going forward (once the normal [[Record_retention#How_long_to_keep_records|retention period]] for tax records has passed), along with the risk they could get lost, destroyed, have ink fade, and so on.  

If you need cash for spending and are choosing between withdrawals from an HSA and a pre-tax traditional account, consider instead the combination of tax-free HSA withdrawal and a [[Roth conversion]]. This has the same tax impact as a pre-tax withdrawal, but shifts money from an HSA to a Roth account, which is desirable for the above reasons. Therefore, you should always withdraw tax-free from an HSA before retirement accounts.

In some cases, it can make sense to withdraw tax-free from an HSA as a tax-planning maneuver even if you do not need the money for spending, and reinvest it in a [[taxable account]]. Examples include when:

*You think there is a chance the money will not be later withdrawn tax-free, because the receipts might get lost, you or your surviving spouse might forget, or you plan to leave the money to a non-spouse and could die suddenly.
*You might have an [[#Overfunded_HSA|overfunded HSA]]. Although the dollars in the taxable account will grow more slowly, the lower tax rates on long-term capital gains and the [[step-up in basis]] should more than compensate for [[stock]]-like investments. See [[#Overfunded_HSA|below]] for more details.

As you reach later retirement, the benefit of continuing to leave money in the HSA decreases (there are fewer years of potential tax-advantaged growth) and the risk of losing the right to withdraw tax-free increases. How long you want to push it is a personal decision, but there will be a point when the benefits no longer outweigh the risks, unless you have named a charitable organization to inherit your HSA.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Handling HSAs After Death or Divorce | author1 = Helen Modly|author2 = Tommie Monez| work = Morningstar| date = October 22, 2016 | accessdate = Jan 22, 2019| url = https://www.morningstar.com/articles/774640/handling-hsas-after-death-or-divorce.html| url-access=subscription | language = en-us | quote=There is a good case for allowing the HSA balances to grow as a cushion for high medical expenses later in life, but consideration should also be given to the inheritance tax disadvantage. Eventually using up the tax-free dollars for medical expenses or naming a charity as beneficiary can mitigate or eliminate the tax consequences.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In mid- to late-retirement, withdrawing the HSA roughly evenly over your life expectancy could be a reasonable compromise.

====Taxable withdrawals====

Taxable withdrawals from an HSA usually do not make sense when other sources of funding are available, because possible future medical expenses would allow future tax-free withdrawals. If you have current or past medical expenses for which you have saved receipts, and can therefore take a tax-free withdrawal, it is almost always better to do so rather than take a taxable withdrawal. Taxable HSA withdrawals can provide a source of funding when other assets have been exhausted. Taxable withdrawals can also be beneficial for tax-planning when you have an overfunded HSA; see [[#Overfunded_HSA|below]].

===How to invest the HSA===

If you are paying current expenses out of pocket, the HSA is intended for medical expenses in retirement. You should therefore invest it as if part of your IRA or 401(k), as those accounts are also invested for retirement expenses. If you are using the HSA for current expenses, consider at least one year's deductible as part of your [[emergency fund]], because it is likely you will need this amount for medical bills; you can invest the remainder as if part of an IRA or 401(k).

If you view the HSA as part of your overall retirement portfolio, you can then choose which assets from your [[asset allocation]] to hold in your HSA, and which to hold elsewhere. If you live in a state that does not recognize HSAs, state taxes give a strong incentive to hold Treasury bonds or TIPS there. In the other states, HSAs are similar to Roth accounts in terms of the principles of [[Tax-efficient_fund_placement#Step_4:_Place_high_growth_stock_funds|tax-efficient fund placement for tax free accounts]]. If you have an [[#Overfunded_HSA|overfunded HSA]], it will behave less like a Roth account and more like a traditional IRA (or even a [[Non-deductible traditional IRA|non-deductible IRA]]) for asset location purposes, and it could make sense to shift your HSA to contain bonds rather than stocks. 

==Overfunded HSA==

An ''overfunded HSA'' is one where the balance exceeds, or is likely to exceed, available qualified medical expenses over your and your spouse's lifetime.

While this can happen, many retirees underestimate their healthcare expenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://moneywise.com/retirement/retirement/nearly-50-of-american-retirees-underestimated-their-healthcare-costs-and-how-far-medicare-would-stretch|title=Nearly 50% of American retirees underestimated their healthcare costs — and how far Medicare would stretch. 3 simple ways to protect yourself|publisher=MoneyWise|accessdate=July 18, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt; High savers may find themselves in higher [[Income-Related Monthly Adjustment Amount (IRMAA)|IRMAA]] tiers, leading to additional qualified medical expenses because Medicare premiums (including IRMAA) are qualified medical expenses for an HSA.

An overfunded HSA may also be intentional, because a high earner planning a lower cost retirement may enjoy the similarity to a traditional deductible IRA and be happy to save a high marginal rate and then pay a lower marginal rate when withdrawing after age 65.

Overfunded HSAs usually result from leaving money invested inside the HSA over long periods of time, where the balance can compound fully tax-deferred; medical expenses do not compound even if they accrue annually. 

===Cautions===

If you are younger and your future medical expenses are very uncertain, it is probably best to leave money in the HSA as long as possible, to prepare for the more likely case that your future medical expenses will let you eventually withdraw the entire HSA balance tax-free.  

Withdrawals for non-medical expenses are taxable, and also have a 20% penalty if you are under age 65. Large HSA balances also increase the risk of leaving your heirs with a large spike of taxable income in a single year. The tax advantages of an HSA are much better when you are able to use it for qualified medical expenses and withdraw tax-free. 

Leaving money in the HSA also has the benefit of many decades of tax-deferred growth, which can [[Non-deductible_traditional_IRA#Performance|overcome]] higher tax rates that might come later on. Actions to mitigate an overfunded HSA are best taken once you are closer to retirement or already in retirement, when you have much less uncertainty about the relative sizes of your HSA and medical expenses.

===Mitigations===

If you might unintentionally have an overfunded HSA, consider one or more of the following strategies to mitigate the tax impact:

*Pay for medical expenses out of the HSA even when you are [[#Maxing_out_retirement_accounts|maxing out your retirement accounts]].
*Withdraw tax-free from your HSA even if you do not need the money for spending, and reinvest the money in a [[taxable account]].
*Shift your [[Bond basics|bond]] allocation into the HSA and [[stock]] allocation into retirement accounts.
*During the accumulation phase, switch to a non-HSA-eligible medical plan (that is, a low-deductible plan) if those premiums are competitive.
*Choose Medicare supplement plans with smaller premiums but higher deductibles, which shifts non-HSA-eligible expenses to HSA-eligible expenses.
*Spread the HSA out over multiple [[Asset_titling_in_the_United_States#Beneficiary_designation|beneficiaries]].
*Name a charity or [[Donor advised fund|Donor Advised Fund (DAF)]] as the beneficiary of the HSA, if you were planning to leave some of your estate to charity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Forum post|t=256861|title=The problem with 'saving receipts' for future qualified HSA withdrawals|date=19 Aug 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If you expect to not live much longer and plan to leave an overfunded HSA to non-spouse heirs, taxable HSA withdrawals should be a higher priority than pre-tax retirement accounts. Unlike pre-tax accounts, HSAs do not get a [[Stretch IRA|ten-year stretch]], which means heirs do not get up to ten years of tax-protected growth, and if the balance is large on a per-heir basis, the large income in a single year can spike their tax rates more than if it were spread across ten years.

===Similarity to a non-deductible IRA===

The up-front tax deduction and potential for tax-free growth is what makes HSA ''contributions'' better than most other retirement account contributions when [[Prioritizing investments]], as noted [[#Contribution_priority_compared_to_other_accounts|above]]. Treating the HSA balance above qualified medical expenses as a [[traditional IRA]] (except without the ability to [[Roth_conversion|convert to Roth]]) is a reasonable perspective. You may also consider the decision of whether to ''leave money inside'' an overfunded HSA that you can now withdraw tax-free as similar to deciding whether to invest in a [[non-deductible traditional IRA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Forum post|t=434227|title=Proposed update to Health Savings Account wiki page|date=22 Jun 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt; If you make a tax-free withdrawal from an HSA, you can reinvest an equal number of dollars in a [[taxable account]]. Although the balance would grow with tax drag, future gains are taxed at lower long-term capital gains rates. If the HSA is overfunded, future growth within the HSA will be taxable at higher ordinary income rates. And importantly, a taxable account gets a [[step-up in basis]] at your death, whereas an HSA does not. The decision to withdraw tax-free also depends on which assets you plan to hold in your HSA; [[Stock|stocks]] tend to perform better when reinvested in a taxable account, while [[Bond basics|bonds]] tend to perform better inside an HSA. See: [[Non-deductible_traditional_IRA#Taxable_account|Comparison between a non-deductible traditional IRA and a taxable account]]. 

If you reduce your projected HSA balance so that you no longer expect it to exceed available medical expenses, the HSA will switch to behaving more like a Roth account (albeit one you should spend down over your lifetime). Further tax-free withdrawals would be trading future tax-free growth for [[Taxable account|taxable]] growth and so would probably not be beneficial. Balancing your HSA balance and expenses regularly as you move through retirement is a good strategy.

==Inherited HSA==
===Spouse beneficiary===

When an HSA holder dies, a surviving spouse who is a beneficiary may assume the HSA as their own, and so reimburse qualified medical expenses of the deceased spouse after assuming ownership of the HSA, free of taxes.&lt;ref name="irs._Publ"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p969.pdf|title=Publication 969, Health Savings Accounts and Other Tax-Favored Health Plans|publisher=IRS|accessdate=June 25, 2024|page=10|quote=Spouse is the designated beneficiary: If your spouse is the designated beneficiary of your HSA, it will be treated as your spouse’s HSA after your death.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Non-spouse beneficiary===

The rules for a non-spouse beneficiary, however, are more complicated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Forum post|t=133792|title=HSA as stealth IRA - Inheritence issue|date=25 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="theb_What"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Choosing Beneficiaries for Your Health or Medical Savings Account | first = Julie | last = Garber | work = The Balance | date = 6 March 2017 | accessdate = 2017-11-04 | url = https://www.thebalance.com/choosing-beneficiaries-for-your-hsa-msa-3505285 | language =  en-us | quote =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Forum post|t=141799|title=After death, is an HSA still an HSA?|date=25 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fair_Fair"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Fairmark Forum :: Retirement Savings and Benefits :: HSA non-spouse beneficiary | author = Spirit Rider | work = fairmark.com | date = 10 September 2013 | accessdate = 2017-11-04 | url = https://fairmark.com/forum/read.php?2,70839 | language = EN | quote =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Forum post|t=221783 | title=HSA beneficiary options (tax considerations) | date=23 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the HSA account-holder dies and does not leave the account to their spouse, the entire value of the HSA becomes taxable to the beneficiary in that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p969.pdf|title=Publication 969, Health Savings Accounts and Other Tax-Favored Health Plans|publisher=IRS|accessdate=June 25, 2024|page=10|quote=Spouse isn’t the designated beneficiary: If your spouse isn’t the designated beneficiary of your HSA, the account stops being an HSA, and the fair market value of the HSA becomes taxable to the beneficiary in the year in which you die.}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the beneficiary may pay the decedent's ''unpaid'' medical expenses, and reduce the taxable amount by the amount paid within 1 year after the date of death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p969.pdf|title=Publication 969, Health Savings Accounts and Other Tax-Favored Health Plans|publisher=IRS|accessdate=June 25, 2024|page=10|quote=The amount taxable to a beneficiary other than the estate is reduced by any qualified medical expenses for the decedent that are paid by the beneficiary within 1 year after the date of death.}}&lt;/ref&gt; If you leave the account to your estate, the value is included on your final income tax return.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p969.pdf|title=Publication 969, Health Savings Accounts and Other Tax-Favored Health Plans|publisher=IRS|accessdate=June 25, 2024|page=10|quote=If your estate is the beneficiary, the value is included on your final income tax return.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike an [[Stretch IRA|inherited IRA]] or [[401(k)]], an HSA inherited by a non-spouse ceases to be a tax-advantaged account, and qualified medical expenses incurred by the decedent can no longer be reimbursed tax-free. As a result, from an estate planning perspective, an HSA has no more value to a non-spouse, non-charitable beneficiary than an equal amount of taxable income, and much less value than an equal amount of cash. For this reason, you should plan to spend down your HSA roughly over your lifetime, and not wait until you are too old to withdraw for past medical expenses. See [[#How_to_use_the_plan/Withdrawing_in_retirement|Withdrawing in retirement]] for strategies on how to mitigate the HSA's estate planning characteristics, and [[#Overfunded_HSA|Overfunded HSA]] for strategies to deal with an HSA that is larger than available qualified medical expenses.

==Advantages==

HSAs are unique among investment accounts in that they can be fully tax-free (contribution, growth, and withdrawal) when used for qualified medical expenses. As most investors will have substantial medical expenses over their lifetime, HSAs provide an opportunity for substantial tax savings compared to using other accounts. Many HSAs are available with great low-cost investment options consistent with [[Bogleheads®_investment_philosophy|Bogleheads®-style investing]]. 

As with a [[Flexible spending arrangement|flexible spending account]], an HSA allows you to contribute tax-deductible dollars and spend them tax-free on medical costs. However, money in a flexible spending account is lost if not used within a grace period after the end of the year, so you can only use it for expected expenses and will pay unexpected medical expenses with after-tax dollars. The HSA allows you to pay all your expenses with pre-tax dollars as long as they fit within the HSA limit, and what is not used continues to roll over to following years.

==Disadvantages==

The main potential disadvantage of the HSA is not the account itself, but the [[High deductible health plan|high-deductible plan]] that goes with it. If you have very low expenses, the high deductible does not matter; if you have very high medical costs, the plan must have a catastrophic maximum out-of-pocket cost which may also save you money. If your expenses are near the deductible, you may be better off without the HSA, using a conventional plan instead. HSAs are not available from all major fund companies, and often have maintenance fees, but there are some good ones in the [[Health_savings_account#HSA_custodians_and_options |HSA custodians and options]] section just below.

As an account, the main disadvantage of HSAs is their poor estate planning characteristics. When left to a non-spouse, the right to withdraw for past medical expenses of the owner is lost, and the entire balance becomes taxable in a single year (although leaving the HSA to a charitable organization eliminates any tax). These characteristics drive the [[#How_to_use_the_plan|strategies]] on how to best use an HSA. See [[Health_savings_account#Inherited HSA|Inherited HSA]] for details.

An HSA may be challenging for someone without a sufficient emergency fund; see [[Prioritizing investments]]. In contrast to an [[Flexible_spending_arrangement#Distributions_from_an_FSA|FSA]] where the entire amount may be available on January 1 each year, funds for an HSA are not available until they are deducted from your paycheck over the course of the year. 

To maximize the tax benefits of the HSA, you may need to store medical receipts for many years or decades before requesting reimbursement. This creates extra work, with the risk that records could be lost, degraded, or destroyed. Filing for reimbursement in the distant future is more difficult than seamless immediate reimbursement when an insurance company directly bills the HSA provider.

! Tax structure
|HSAs are “triple tax-free” when used for qualified medical expenses: contributions are deductible, growth is tax-protected, and qualified withdrawals are tax-free. Non-qualified withdrawals after age 65 are penalty-free but taxable, so the account behaves like a pre-tax retirement account in this case.||Deductible retirement account contributions are taxable when withdrawn. Roth contributions are taxable when made but tax-free with withdrawn. [[Non-deductible traditional IRA|Non-deductible IRAs]] are a special case.||HSAs are fully tax-free in the most common case where sufficient medical expenses are available. In the worst case when they are not, the HSA behaves like a pre-tax retirement account. For this reason, HSAs will be as good or better than retirement accounts for taxes, and investors should usually [[#Contribution_priority_compared_to_other_accounts|contribute to an HSA first]].
|-
! [[State income taxes|State taxes]]
|HSA contributions are tax-deductible in all income-taxing states except for California and New Jersey.||Massachusetts does not allow deductions for [[traditional IRA]] contributions, but they do for all other pre-tax retirement accounts (401k, 403b, etc.). New Jersey does not allow deductions for contributions to retirement accounts ''except'' for a pre-tax 401k. Pennsylvania does not allow any retirement account deductions, but does not tax retirement withdrawals, so they behave like Roth accounts for state tax purposes. Alabama, Colorado, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, and New York exclude some federally-taxable retirement withdrawals from taxation. Illinois, Iowa, and Mississippi do not tax any distributions from retirement accounts, but allow deductions for pre-tax contributions. Georgia has a large exemption for all income in retirement, making retirement withdrawals tax-free for many retirees. Other income-taxing states follow federal tax rules for retirement accounts.||Investors in California or New Jersey will probably still come out ahead using an HSA for medical expenses compared to a retirement account.
|-
! [[Payroll - FICA tax deductions|Payroll taxes]]
|HSA contributions made through an [[Payroll - cafeteria plan deductions|employer payroll deduction]] are payroll tax-deductible. Contributions made directly to a HSA custodian are not.||Retirement plan contributions are not payroll tax-deductible, except for employer contributions to an employer plan.||Investors above the second Social Security [[Social Security as an investment|bend point]] and/or above the Social Security Wage Base will see an advantage with the payroll tax deduction. Investors who do not want to avoid payroll tax can contribute directly to the HSA custodian. HSAs have the advantage.

IRAs offer a wide variety of investments. Self-directed retirement accounts offer an even wider range of investments.||Plan-dependent. IRAs usually have an advantage over employer plans and HSAs. But, there are plenty of HSAs and employer plans with sufficient variety of good investments to build a portfolio.
|-
! Fees
|Most HSAs have modest fees in the 0.3%/year range, and may also require a certain balance to be kept in cash rather than invested. Investors can choose their own HSA custodian, and at least one offers fee-free HSAs ([[#Fidelity|Fidelity]]), but if it is not the custodian chosen by your employer, you will lose the payroll tax deduction by contributing directly.||Employer plans can have high fees (~1-2%+ per year), but plan fees have come down on average in recent decades, and many have no fees except those within the offered mutual funds. Most IRA custodians offer fee-free IRAs.||Depends on the plan. HSAs tend to have higher fees than IRAs and good workplace plans, but are usually better than bad workplace plans. You can choose a fee-free HSA custodian (like [[#Fidelity|Fidelity]]), but if you contribute through an employer, you will have to periodically roll over money into your preferred custodian.
|-
! Compatibility with [[Backdoor Roth|Backdoor Roth IRA]]
|HSA balances do not interfere with the Backdoor Roth IRA.||Pre-tax traditional (along with SEP and SIMPLE) IRA balances ''do'' interfere with the Backdoor Roth IRA, but workplace plan balances do not.||HSAs have an advantage over deductible traditional IRAs. 
|-
! Early distribution options
| Tax- and penalty-free withdrawals are always allowed for current medical expenses, and past medical expenses that accrued after the HSA was established and for which you have saved the receipts. Otherwise, nonqualified HSA withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income and also charged a 20% penalty. The penalty is waived after age 65.||Withdrawals before age 59½ are charged a 10% penalty, with the following exceptions: disability, [[Substantially equal periodic payments|SEPP]], IRS levy, medical expenses, separation from service age 55 or older, and others. Plans may offer loans, hardship withdrawals, and/or in-service withdrawals, but whether these withdrawals incur penalties is subject to IRS rules. [[Roth IRA]] contributions can always be withdrawn tax- and penalty-free. Otherwise, early withdrawals are taxable and charged a 10% penalty.||Early HSA early withdrawals are more heavily penalized by paying twice the penalty rate, paying taxes that might otherwise not need to be paid, and the higher age limit. However, in practice most HSA owners will have plenty of medical expenses that can be used for qualified withdrawals, and those with [[#Overfunded_HSA|overfunded HSAs]] probably have other sources of funds, so this is not usually a serious disadvantage. 
|-
! [[Record retention]]
|When using an HSA as an investment account and leaving money in the account for tax-advantaged growth, you will need to save records for all medical expenses you incurred after the HSA was established. Storing and preserving these records over potentially many decades is not a trivial effort. ||Retirement accounts generally require minimal record retention. [[Roth IRA]] owners should keep a record of when the account was first established, contributions, and any [[Roth conversion|Roth conversions]], to avoid unnecessary taxes and penalties on [[Roth_IRA#Distributions|distributions]]. [[Traditional IRA]] owners making [[Non-deductible traditional IRA|non-deductible]] contributions need to keep track of their basis.||In order to realize the main tax benefits of an HSA, you may need to carefully keep records over long periods of time. If you are not confident you will be able to keep records, you should likely contribute to retirement accounts first.

|-
! Inheritance
| Spouses can [[#Spouse_beneficiary|inherit an HSA]] and treat it as their own, and can withdraw tax-free based on their own medical expenses and those of their deceased spouse for which they have receipts.

As of April 2024, BenefitWallet HSAs have been transitioned to [[#Health_Equity|HealthEquity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www2.healthequity.com/benefitwallet2/members/|title=Welcome to HealthEquity|publisher=HealthEquity|accessdate=July 7, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Discovery Benefits (WEX) ===

The Discovery Benefits (Wex) HSA is only offered through employer plans.

Terms and fees may vary from one company to another, so be sure to verify this information for your own employer. To view the fee schedule, log in to your account, then click the "Get Help" link which takes you into a help site. From there, in the search function search for "fee". You should see a search result for "Article ID: PROD-2175 | Health Savings Account (HSA) custodial management fee FAQ" which explains the general fees.

For at least one Discovery Benefits HSA member, the "The custodial management fee is a flat fee of 25 basis points per year that is assessed quarterly. This equates to 0.0625% each quarter on any dollars currently invested in mutual funds... The HealthcareBank interest-bearing account is excluded from this fee." There are no low-balance fees in the savings account, or other fees. As noted, the fee schedule may vary from one company to another, depending on the terms negotiated between each company and Discovery Benefits.

If your HSA balance is low, then the fees are lower than many employer-based HSAs that charge a flat monthly fee. But since the fee is assessed as a percentage on your balance, then the higher your balance, the greater your fees. For this reason, if you wish to avoid these fees, it would be advisable to perform an annual HSA transfer or rollover to a no-fee HSA.

==== Discovery Benefits Investment Platform ====

The investing platform is available for any HSA balance over $1,000. You can set up automated investing so that any balance over the minimum is automatically invested. The platform contains multiple Vanguard index funds in the institutional share class, as well as Target Retirement date funds.

There are no investment trading fees or fees to use the investment platform, beyond standard mutual fund expense ratios. WageWorks also charges an additional $3.95 monthly fee for account holders who are no longer employed by their employers; as such, an individual who is enrolled in a WageWorks HSA and who leaves their employer should transfer out of WageWorks to a different custodian and close their WageWorks HSA. Additionally, there is a $16.00 transfer of asset (TOA) to another custodian fee.&lt;ref name="smar_"&gt;{{Cite web |title=WageWorks HSA Fee Schedule |author= |work=smart-hsa.com |date=1 April 2016 |access-date=22 January 2019 |url= https://www.smart-hsa.com/pdf/getpdf.asp?id=WW-0601_CustodyDisclosureDoc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the investment platform, there are approximately 35 mutual funds in the following asset classes: Large Cap US Equity, Small and Mid-Cap US Equity, International Equity, Fixed Income, and All-in-One (target date and two Vanguard LifeStrategy funds).

'''{{PAGENAME}}''', [[renters' insurance]], and [[landlords' insurance]] generally provide coverage for loss of your own property and liability to others which occurred because of their presence on your property. Deductibles are usually available. While a homeowner is paying off a mortgage on their house the lender will usually require homeowner's insurance, as may a buyer during the process of selling the house.

There are always excluded perils, which means that if the loss is caused by one of those items then the insurance provides no coverage. There may be ways to cover these exclusions, either by riders amending the standard policy for an additional fee or by purchasing specialty insurance such as [[earthquake insurance|earthquake]] or [[flood insurance]]. 

==Types of homeowner's insurance==

Standard policies are often referred to as:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scc.virginia.gov/boi/pubs/hoguide.pdf Homeowners Insurance Guide], Commonwealth of Virginia SCC Bureau of Insurance &lt;/ref&gt;
*HO-2 Broad Form (Named Peril)- a basic policy covering 16 or more common disasters.&lt;ref group="note"&gt; These enumerated perils include: 1.Fire and lightning 2. Removal of property endangered by any insured peril 3. Windstorm 4. Hail 5. Explosion 6. Riot and civil commotion 7. Vehicle or aircraft damage to your property 8. Smoke 9. Vandalism and malicious mischief 10. Breakage of glass 11. Theft 12. Falling objects 13. Weight of ice, snow or sleet damage 14. Collapse of building and any part thereof 15. Sudden and accidental damage, cracking, burning or bulging from steam or hot water heating system or appliances for heating water 16. Accidental discharge or overflow of water or steam from plumbing or heating systems 17. Freezing of plumbing, heating or air conditioning systems and domestic appliances 18. Sudden and accidental injury from artificially generated electrical currents 19. Limited coverage for trees, shrubs or plants 20. Additional living expenses 21. Personal liability insurance protection 22. Medical payments coverage &lt;/ref&gt;
*HO-3 Special Form- The typical, most comprehensive form used for single-family homes. This policy protects your home from all perils except those specifically excluded.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iii.org/articles/are-there-different-types-of-policies.html Are there different types of policies?], Insurance Information Institute &lt;/ref&gt; 
*HO-4 Renters Insurance (Contents Broad Form)- this policy protects a renter's possessions, and can provide liability protection.
*HO-5 Comprehensive Form (HO-3 with HO-15, Special Personal Property Coverage)- Covers the same as HO3 plus more. On this policy the contents are covered on an open peril basis, therefore as long as the cause of loss is not specifically excluded in the policy it will be covered for that cause of loss. 
*HO-6 Condominium Unit Owners - For condo and co-op owners, this policy provides coverage for both your belongings and the structural parts of the building that you own.
*MV Market Value or Older Homes Forms (Modified Coverage Form)- usually this coverage will be based on an actual cash value basis (replacement minus depreciation).

The homeowners policy contains two sections. Section I provides property coverages (A, B, C and D) while Section II provides liability coverages (E and F). A brief description of the individual coverages follows:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insurance.ca.gov/0100-consumers/0060-information-guides/0040-residential/residential-insurance.cfm#gettingthe Consumers:residential insurance], California Department of Insurance: &lt;/ref&gt;

*Coverage A - Dwelling
*Coverage B - Other Structures
*Coverage C - Personal Property
*Coverage D - Loss of Use
*Coverage E - Personal Liability
*Coverage F - Medical Payments to Others

The typical policy has the following limits on coverage:

==Replacement cost vs. market value==
When insuring the value of a home, homeowner's can usually choose among three levels of coverage.

*'''Actual cash value''' - This value covers the house plus the value of your belongings after deducting depreciation.
*'''Replacement cost''' - This is the actual cash value without the deduction for depreciation.
*'''Guaranteed (or extended) replacement cost''' - This policy pays whatever it costs to repair or build your home. Some insurers only offer extended replacement insurance, providing for a 20-25% increase over the replacement cost value.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.investopedia.com/articles/pf/08/homeowner-insurance.asp#ixzz1f0eX7A2s The Beginner's Guide To Homeowners' Insurance], investopedia, (January 23, 2011) &lt;/ref&gt;

==Discounts and deductibles==
There are a number of steps a policyholder can take to reduce the cost of homeowner's insurance without reducing the amount of coverage. Insurance companies may provide discounts for the following actions:&lt;ref name="twelveways"&gt; [http://www.iinc.org/articles/33/1/Twelve-Ways-To-Lower-Your-Homeowners-Insurance-Costs/Page1.html Twelve Ways to Lower Your Homeowner's Insurance Costs] &lt;/ref&gt;
* Adding smoke detectors, fire extinguishers, dead bolts and burglar alarms can often result in a discount.
* Some insurer's will discount homeowner insurance premiums if you also insure your automobile with the company.
* Discounts are often available to non-smokers and senior citizens.
* Discounts are often available if you stay with the same insurer for many years. 

The insurance premium can also be reduced by increasing the deductible you are willing to pay for each claim. Deductibles on homeowners policies usually start at $250.
Depending upon the insurer, deductibles can be reduced as follows:
* increasing your deductible to $500, you could save up to 12 percent; 
* increasing your deductible to $1,000, you could save up to 24 percent; 
* increasing your deductible to $2,500, you could save up to 30 percent;
* increasing your deducible to $5,000, you could save up to 37 percent.&lt;ref name="twelveways" /&gt;

==Hurricane deductible==
The heavy damage associated with hurricanes and tropical storms has led insurance companies to levy a hurricane deductible assessed to claims associated with storm wind damage. The deductible is triggered only when there is a hurricane or tropical storm. Currently, eighteen states have the hurricane deductible: Alabama, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Mississippi, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Texas, Virginia and Washington DC.&lt;ref name="hurricane"&gt; [http://www.iii.org/media/hottopics/insurance/hurricanwindstorm/ Hurricane and Windstorm Deductibles], Insurance Information Institute, September 2011. &lt;/ref&gt;

The deductible can be either a dollar amount, or more commonly, a percentage amount (usually 1 to 5 percent, but can be higher in some coastal areas with high wind risk). In many states a policyholder may be given the option of paying a higher premium for a dollar deductible, but in high risk coastal areas the percentage deductible is usually mandatory. 

{{blockquote|''Example'': Arthur and Mary have a homeowner's policy that includes a hurricane deductible since they live in a high risk coastal region of North Carolina. Their policy has a $500 standard deductible, so they must pay the first $500 of a standard claim out of pocket. The hurricane percentage deductibles are based on the home's insured value. Their house is insured for $200,000 and has a 5 percent hurricane deductible, so the first $10,000 of a claim due to storm damage must be paid out of their pocket.&lt;ref  name="hurricane" /&gt;}}

{{for|a full discussion|wikipedia:Professional liability insurance}}

'''{{PAGENAME}}''', also called '''Professional Indemnity Insurance''', protects professional practitioners such as architects, lawyers, physicians, and accountants against potential negligence claims made by their patients/clients. Professional [[liability insurance]] may take on different names depending on the profession. For example, professional liability insurance in reference to the medical profession may be called Medical Malpractice.

Notaries public may take out errors and omissions insurance (E&amp;O). Other potential E&amp;O policyholders include real estate brokers, home inspectors, appraisers, and website developers. There are also specific E&amp;O policies for technology companies, such as software developers, technology consultants and other creators of technology.

This coverage focuses on the failure to perform, financial loss and error or omission of the products or services sold. Additional coverage can be added for breach of warranty, intellectual property, personal injury, security and cost of contract.

{{for|a full discussion|wikipedia:Accidental death and dismemberment insurance}}

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' (also known as AD&amp;D) is a form of [[insurance]] covering death or specific types of injury as a result of an accident. In the event of accidental death, this insurance will pay benefits in addition to any life insurance held. Death by illness, suicide, or natural causes is generally not covered by AD&amp;D.

Additionally, AD&amp;D generally pays benefits for the loss of limbs, fingers, sight and permanent paralysis. The types of injuries covered and the amount paid vary by insurer and package, and are explicitly enumerated in the insurance policy.

There are four common types of group AD&amp;D plans offered in the United States:
*'''Group life supplement''' - the AD&amp;D benefit is included as part of a group life insurance contract, and the benefit amount is usually the same as that of the group life benefit; 
*'''Voluntary''' - the AD&amp;D is offered to members of a group as a separate, elective benefit, and premiums are generally paid as a payroll deduction; 
*'''Travel accident (business trip)''' - the AD&amp;D benefit is provided through an employee benefit plan and provides supplemental accident protection to workers while they are traveling on company business (the entire premium is usually paid by the employer); 
*'''Dependents''' - Some group AD&amp;D plans also provide coverage for dependents.

{{for|a full discussion|wikipedia:Landlords' insurance}}

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a policy to cover a property owner from financial losses connected with their property which they let out. A landlords' [[insurance]] policy will mainly cover the building itself with the option of including the contents left within. The policy will normally cover standard perils such as fire, lightning, explosion, earthquake, storm, flood, escape of water or oil, subsidence, theft and malicious damage.

Each insurance policy is different and may or may not include all these items. Most companies will provide the option to have extra cover on top of what is considered the standard cover. These may include things such as accidental damage, legal protection, alternative accommodation costs or rent guarantee insurance.

{{for|a full discussion|wikipedia:Lenders mortgage insurance}}

Most lenders require '''{{PAGENAME}}''' (PMI) for loans that exceed 80% of the home’s value. The [[insurance]] protects the lender, but the borrower pays an initial premium of 0.5% to 1% and a monthly charge. This insurance lets the borrower obtain loans for which they would not ordinarily qualify.

{{for|a full discussion|wikipedia:Umbrella insurance}}

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' refers to an [[insurance]] policy that protects the assets and future income of the policyholder above and beyond the standard limits set on their primary policies.

Typically, an umbrella policy is pure liability coverage over and above the coverage afforded by the regular policy, and is sold in increments of one million dollars. The term "umbrella" is used because it covers liability claims from all policies underneath it, such as [[Auto insurance|autos]] and [[Homeowner's insurance|homeowners]] policies.

For example, if you have an auto insurance policy with liability limits of $500,000 and a Homeowners policy with a limit of $300,000, then with a million dollar umbrella, your limits become in effect, $1,500,000 on the auto policy and $1,300,000 on a homeowners liability claim.

Umbrella insurance provides broad insurance beyond traditional home and auto. It provides additional liability coverage above the limits of your homeowner's, auto, and boat insurance policies.

Some forum members suggest a coverage limit equal to your [[net worth]], but this may not be the best guidance. A general suggestion would be to buy at least as much as the dollar amount that a jury and court may award in the event of a case against you.

{{for|a full discussion|wikipedia:Renters' insurance}}

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a type of [[Homeowner's insurance|home insurance]] that protects the holder against accidents, damages, and losses that occur in a rented residence. Renters' insurance provides coverage both for the insured's belongings and for liability that may result from an accident in the insured's home.

Many policies cover replacement cost, meaning that the insured will receive the money necessary to purchase a new item that is equivalent to the damaged one instead of a portion of that cost adjusted for depreciation.

{{for|a full discussion|wikipedia:Title insurance}}

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is indemnity [[insurance]] against financial loss from defects in title to real property and from the invalidity or unenforceability of mortgage liens. Title insurance is principally a product developed and sold in the United States as a result of the comparative deficiency of the US land records laws.

It is meant to protect an owner's or a lender's financial interest in real property against loss due to title defects, liens or other matters. It will defend against a lawsuit attacking the title as it is insured, or reimburse the insured for the actual monetary loss incurred, up to the dollar amount of insurance provided by the policy.

'''Life insurance''' is a contract between the insured, the owner (who may also be the insured), and a life insurance company.  The owner pays a stipulated premium to the insurance company. If the insured dies while the policy is in force a death benefit is paid to the beneficiary.  Some policies accumulate cash value which is available by loan or upon surrender to the owner.  Also, some policies have accelerated death benefits which may be available if the insured is expected to die within six months to a year.&lt;ref&gt;Definition of life insurance by forum member mephistophles (Lee E. Marshall), a Chartered Life Underwriter (CLU)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of life insurance ==
Life insurance can broadly be divided into three general categories - "term", "permanent", and "group".  Term life insurance is usually intended for "temporary" insurance needs, such as insuring a family breadwinner while others are dependent on their income.  Permanent life insurance is usually intended for "lifetime" insurance needs or cash accumulation.  Group life insurance is usually provided through an employer or other association, as opposed to term and permanent which are sold to individuals.

* '''Term life insurance''' usually provides a level death benefit for a certain number of years, at a premium rate guaranteed for the term period.  For example, a typical 20 year term policy would provide a level death benefit, such as $1 million, for a period of 20 years, in exchange for a premium of $X per year.  Level term insurance is typically sold for periods of 10-30 years, with the most popular periods being 15 and 20 years.  (Note that a small number of term life insurance policies are sold with premiums that rise every year, 5 years, etc., and/or with death benefits that decrease over time.)  Most policies sold as "level term life insurance" actually continue beyond the initial premium guarantee period at a much higher premium, but the insured can lapse the policy at any time and is not obligated to pay the much higher "post-level" premium rate.
* '''Permanent life insurance''' provides a death benefit for the entirety of the insured's life.  There are several types of permanent life insurance, as follows:
** '''Whole life insurance''' has a premium and death benefit that is fixed and guaranteed to be level for life.  Because the chances of death increase as time goes on, the premiums paid in the early years exceed the probability of death, and therefore a "cash value" builds up within the policy over time.  The policyholder can typically access the cash value by surrendering the policy, which terminates the insurance coverage, and can also take out "policy loans" from the insurance company, based on the security of the cash value.  Most whole life policies are sold by "mutual" life insurance companies, and pay non-guaranteed "policyholder dividends" on an annual basis, which reduce the net cost of the whole life policy.  The policyholder dividends can be used to reduce future premium payments, purchase additional insurance coverage, or just accumulate within the policy.
** '''Universal life''' is the general name for several life insurance products that use an "account value", which is a notional account maintained by the insurance company.  Premiums paid by the policyholder are added to the account value (net of any premium loads).  Deductions from the account value are made by the insurance company, generally on a monthly basis, for cost of insurance charges, rider charges, and any other expense loads.  Additional credits to the account value are made with respect to interest or equity market returns on the account value.  A universal life policy generally remains in force as long as the account value is positive, and lapses if the account value drops to zero.  Most universal life products have "surrender charges" in the early durations of the policy, which reduce the amount available to the policyholder for loan or surrender.  The policyholder can access the account value (net of surrender charges) by fully surrendering the policy, which terminates the insurance coverage, by making a "partial surrender" of the account value, or by taking out a policy loan.   Within the general category of universal life, there are several distinct products as follows:
*** '''Traditional universal life''' (or just plain "universal life" or "UL") credits interest to the account value at a rate declared by the company.  The interest rate credited is guaranteed to not fall below a rate guaranteed in the policy (often 3%, but may be lower or higher).
*** '''Indexed universal life''' (often referred to as "IUL") credits interest to the account value based on the performance of an external index, such as the S&amp;P 500.  The interest credited is limited by "caps" and "participation rates" declared by the insurance company.  Usually, the interest credit is guaranteed to be not less than zero, even if the external index declines.
*** '''Guaranteed universal life''' (often referred to as "GUL") works similar to traditional universal life.  However, there is a "secondary guarantee" that the policy will not lapse, even if the account value falls below zero, so long as the premiums required by the policy are paid.  GUL policies typically build minimal or zero cash values, and are therefore less expensive per dollar of death benefit than other types of permanent life insurance.
*** '''Variable universal life''' (often referred to as "VUL") works similar to traditional universal life.  However, rather than having the account value invested in the general funds of the insurance company, it is invested in mutual funds chosen by the policyholder.  The account value can decline from year to year if the mutual funds decline in value.
* '''Group life insurance''' is a product usually offered through an employer.  It generally does not build cash values.  Amounts offered may be a flat amount (such as $50,000 of death benefit), or a percentage of salary (typically 1X or 2X salary, subject to a maximum amount).  Some employers offer additional amount of life insurance on a "voluntary" basis, often subject to individual underwriting.  Group life coverage typically ends when the employment relationship ends, but most plans allow the employee to "convert" to an individual life insurance policy, usually at an extremely high premium.  Many employers partially or fully pay the cost of group life insurance on their employees.  Group life insurance is also offered through professional organizations such as engineers or accountants, often at very attractive premium rates.  (See additional comments on group life insurance [[Life insurance#Further information on group life insurance|below]].)

== Purchasing individual life insurance ==
Most individual life insurance is sold through independent brokers or "tied" agents, while a few companies sell "direct to consumer".

* '''Independent brokers''' are "appointed" as agents for a number of life insurance companies, which allows them to submit applications for life insurance to the companies with which they are licensed. Such brokers often “shop” the coverage for a prospective insured to a number of different life insurers, trying to win the most favorable terms for their clients.  While most independent brokers operate in a limited geographic area, some have established internet websites to allow them to solicit clients nationwide.
* '''"Captive" agents''' primarily write life insurance for one life insurance company with which they are associated.  Often the insurance company provides such agents with training, office space, etc.  Such agents may also write a limited amount of business for other companies.  Most captive agents are affiliated either with mutual life insurance companies, or with company groups that write both property and casualty insurance (homeowners, auto, etc.) and life insurance.
* '''"Direct to consumer"''' sales use life insurance company employees who are also licensed as insurance agents to write applications for prospective policyholders.

Brokers and captive agents are usually compensated by commissions which are paid by the insurance company and whose cost is built into the pricing of the product. Life insurance commissions are generally “heaped” toward the first policy year, with renewal commissions at a much lower rate.

Depending on the amount of life insurance applied for and the age/health of the prospective insured, the life insurer might require a limited physical examination as a part of the application and underwriting process.  For younger insureds and lower face amounts, the insurer might rely solely upon a questionnaire and an examination of medical and prescription drug records.  Based on the underwriting review, the insurer will slot the applicant into a risk class, with lower premiums being charged to “better” risk classes.  Certain conditions, usually medical in nature, might cause the insurer to assess “substandard” premiums above the standard quoted rate. The insurer also might decline to provide coverage to a prospective insured if the underwriting results are quite unfavorable.  Insurers may view underwriting conditions differently, so agents may consider multiple insurers so that they can find the best rate for prospective insureds.

By law, the rates for any specific life insurance policy are identical no matter how the policy is bought.  That is, the policy that is bought from "Company A", assuming the same specifications, will have the identical premium and terms whether you buy it through "Agent A", "Agent B", or any website.

Most life insurers have ratings from a firm called [https://web.ambest.com/home AM Best], which rates all insurance companies.  The majority of companies that are competitively active in writing life insurance have ratings from AM Best of A- or higher, which should be adequately conservative for all life insurance policies except the very largest, where the insured might choose to divide coverage between two or more companies. Other rating agencies that cover insurance companies include Fitch Ratings, Standard &amp; Poor's, and Moody's, but not all life insurers have ratings from each of the agencies.

== Tax treatment of life insurance ==
Under US tax law, death benefits from all types of life insurance are generally not taxable income to the beneficiary.  Also, life insurance premiums are generally not a deductible expense.

For permanent life insurance policies, the growth in policy cash value is excluded from income, even though such growth may represent an increase in the policyholder's wealth.  Cash surrenders from a permanent life insurance policy are ordinary taxable income to the extent that the cash surrender amount is higher than the "basis" of the policy (generally the cumulative premiums paid).  In the case of partial surrenders, amounts received are treated first as a return of basis, with tax owed only on additional surrenders above the basis.  Further, as with loans against most kinds of assets, loans secured by permanent life insurance policies are not treated as taxable income.

In some rare cases, a permanent life insurance policy may be classified as a "modified endowment contract" (MEC).  In those cases, partial surrenders are taxed as income until all gain in the policy has been removed, and only then are partial surrenders taxed as a return of basis.  Further, loans secured by modified endowment contracts are treated as surrenders or distributions.  Most policyholders and life insurers try to avoid having policies classified as modified endowment contracts.

For US federal [[Estate and inheritance tax|estate and gift tax purposes]], which as of 2023 affects estates of single individuals valued over $12.92 million, death benefit proceeds from life insurance policies are generally includable in the decedent’s gross estate and hence are generally subject to the estate tax.  Some families take steps to avoid this outcome, such as having other family members or specially designed “irrevocable life insurance trusts” own life insurance policies.

== Boglehead view of life insurance products ==
Based on observation of posts to the Boglehead Forum, following is the general view of Bogleheads on the topic of life insurance.

* '''Need for life insurance''' - Majority opinion is that life insurance is an appropriate financial tool for a person who has someone else dependent on their income and/or survival; for example, the breadwinner of a family or a parent caring for a child.  However, life insurance is not generally recommended for a person who has no one dependent on their income or survival; for example, a single person with no dependents, or a child.
* '''When is term life insurance appropriate''' - Majority opinion is that term life insurance is appropriate for the vast majority of life insurance needs, including, but not limited to:
** A family with young children might choose to insure the breadwinner(s) for a duration until the children are in college or on their own, to provide for the income that would be lost if the breadwinner were to die while the children are dependent.  
** A family might also choose to insure a non-working parent, reflecting the additional cost of childcare or reduced income from the other parent if the non-working parent were to die while the children are dependent.  
** A breadwinner might be insured to bridge to retirement, pension benefits, or Social Security availability for a non-working spouse.
** Note that some may choose to "ladder" term life insurance policies, purchasing (for example) both a 10 year and 20 year policy, to provide more insurance during the first 10 years and reduced coverage thereafter as needs change and the assets of the family increase.
* '''When is permanent life insurance appropriate''' - Majority opinion is that permanent life insurance is appropriate for only a relatively small subset of the population.  Such situations include, but are not limited to:
** Those who have children with special needs who (a) require an income supplement for the rest of their life and (b) are expected to live beyond their parent's death.
** Situations where liquid assets are needed when the insured dies.  Examples could include those who will owe estate taxes at their death and do not want to liquidate assets to pay the taxes, or to fund a buy-sell agreement in a closely held business.
** Individuals with very high incomes who live in high-tax states may find that the after-tax return on permanent life insurance is attractive compared to alternative fixed income investments.
** Note that the large commissions paid to agents generally make permanent life insurance a poor choice for short-term savings, due to surrender charges (on a universal life policy) or low early cash values (on a whole life policy).  But over a longer time horizon, the pre-tax performance of permanent life insurance (excluding variable universal life) will tend to be similar to conservative fixed-income investments.  Hence, savers with high income tax rates who have an asset allocation that includes fixed income may benefit from permanent life insurance.  Further note that equities held in a taxable brokerage account already have significant tax advantages, and therefore placing equities inside a variable universal life policy is generally not advisable.
* '''When is group life appropriate''' - Majority opinion is that an employee should elect any group life benefit that is offered for "free" by an employer.  Under US tax law, premiums for group life benefits of $50,000 or less are not taxable income to the employee.  However, majority opinion is that primary insurance coverage should generally be provided by an individual life policy, rather than a group policy, since the group life insurance will terminate when the employee leaves the employer.  (See additional comments on group life [[Life insurance#Further information on group life insurance|below]])

== Further information on group life insurance ==
Group life insurance premiums are typically based on the average mortality risk of all eligible members of the group, rather than being customized to the health of a particular insured.  An employee in good health can often find comparable coverage for a lower premium in the private market, making group insurance (beyond any "free" amount provided by the employer) a relatively poor financial choice.  However, an employee who is at higher risk may find that group insurance is less expensive than insurance in the private market, and might weigh these savings against the risk of leaving the group and losing coverage (or having to pay the higher "conversion" premium). 

Some amount of group life insurance is often "guaranteed issue" to eligible members of the group.  For example, new employees may be guaranteed the right to purchase X times their salary in coverage during the first 30 days of employment.  This feature makes group insurance a useful option for insureds whose health makes them uninsurable in the private market.

==Determining family life insurance needs==
This worksheet assumes that both spouses are working and will continue to work if one partner dies prematurely.  Replacing 100% of your after-tax income may be a good starting place.  This should leave the survivor with the same standard of living.  Some expenses go down when one partner dies but other expenses, such as childcare, usually go up.

==Locating a lost policy==
If you’ve lost a loved one, determining if a life insurance exists, or obtaining the details of an existing policy, may be difficult. Here are a few suggestions:
* '''Search personal records:''' Look through files, safe deposit boxes and other areas where your loved one might have kept insurance documents.&lt;ref name="insure"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.insure.com/life-insurance/lost-policies.html|title=How to find lost life insurance policies |format= |page=|publisher=Insure.com|date = December 19, 2019|accessdate=28 Jan 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;
**If the policy is not evident, try to find the name of the life insurance company that issued the policy. For clues, go through bank and credit card statements to look for evidence of premium payments made to an insurance company.&lt;ref name="iii"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iii.org/article/how-can-i-locate-lost-life-insurance-policy|title=12 steps for locating a lost life insurance policy|format=|page=|publisher=Insurance Information Institute, Inc.|accessdate=28 Jan 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Contact financial advisors:''' Present or prior attorneys, accountants, investment advisors, bankers, business insurance agents/brokers and other financial professionals might have information about the deceased’s life insurance policies.&lt;ref name="iii" /&gt;
* '''Check with employers:''' Contact the employee benefits administrators of your relative's former employers to see if any group life insurance policies are still in effect or if your loved one purchased additional voluntary coverage at work.&lt;ref name="insure" /&gt;
* '''Check the mail:''' Look for premium notices or dividend notices. If a policy has been paid up, there will no notice of premium payments due; however, the company may still send an annual notice regarding the status of the policy or notice of a dividend.&lt;ref name="iii" /&gt;
* '''Review income tax returns:''' Life insurance companies pay interest on accumulations on permanent policies and charge interest on policy loans.&lt;ref name="iii" /&gt;

Insurance companies will assist you to locate a lost policy. All you need is the name of the insurer that issued the policy; from there you can contact the insurer to start a claim, even if you don’t know the policy number. A list of policy locators is in the section [[#Lost policy finders|below]].

If you are unsure a policy exists, or you don’t know the name of the insurance company, the NAIC (National Association of Insurance Commissioners) provides a free policy locator that will place inquiries with participating companies. Start here: [https://eapps.naic.org/life-policy-locator/#/welcome Life Insurance Policy Locator Service]

Insurance companies are obligated to find policy beneficiaries. If no beneficiaries are found, they are required by law to turn unclaimed funds over to the state (called "escheatment").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.metlife.com/policyfinder/|title=Policy Finder |format= |page=|publisher=Metropolitan Life Insurance Company|date = |accessdate=28 Jan 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The unclaimed funds are turned over into your state's unclaimed property division. Insurance companies turn policy proceeds over to these divisions when they know the insured person has died but can't find the beneficiary. The National Association of Unclaimed Property Administrators website provides links to unclaimed property divisions in each state. See: [https://unclaimed.org/search-for-your-unclaimed-property-its-free/ Search for your unclaimed property]&lt;ref name="insure" /&gt;

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' and trusts are often used for [[estate planning]] purposes. Most often these structures are used for the following reasons:
# To pay [[Estate and inheritance tax|estate tax]];
# Concern of leaving a large sum of money unsupervised to a minor or an irresponsible adult.
# [[Asset protection]] for beneficiaries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/10/irrevocable-life-insurance-trust.asp When is it a good idea to use an irrevocable life insurance trust?]&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Wealth transfer insurance structures==

===Second-to-die insurance===
{{quotation|A type of life insurance on two people (usually married) that provides benefits to the heirs only after the last surviving spouse dies. This differs from regular life insurance in that the surviving partner doesn't receive any benefits after their spouse dies. Thus, second-to-die insurance is used for estate planning. Parents who take out this type of insurance are thinking of their children, not themselves. For example, it could be designed to pay estate taxes or support any surviving children. It is also called "Dual-Life Insurance" and "Survivorship Insurance".|[http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/secondtodieinsurance.asp Investopedia]}} 

===Irrevocable insurance trusts===
{{quotation|An irrevocable trust set up with a life insurance policy as the asset, allowing the grantor of the policy to exempt asset away from his or her taxable estate. Once the life insurance policy is placed in the trust, the insured person no longer owns the policy, which will be managed by the trustee on behalf of the policy beneficiaries when the insured person dies. The insurance trust, or irrevocable life insurance trust (ILIT), is often used to set aside cash proceeds that can be used to pay estate taxes, as the life insurance policy should be exempt from the taxable estate of the decedent.

One catch on the insurance trust is that the life insurance policy must be transferred to the trust at least three years before the death of the insured. To get around this rule, a new policy can be taken out with a spouse as owner, then placed in the trust. As an irrevocable trust, changes can only be made by beneficiaries; the owner gives up all control to the trustee. If the size of the taxable estate is below the maximum exclusion figure, it is generally not necessary to set up an insurance trust; in this case the life insurance will be included in the decedent’s taxable estate.|[http://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/insurance_trust.asp Investopedia]}}

'''Life insurance''' is a contract between the insured, the owner (who may also be the insured), and a life insurance company.  The owner pays a stipulated premium to the insurance company. If the insured dies while the policy is in force a death benefit is paid to the beneficiary.  Some policies accumulate cash value which is available by loan or upon surrender to the owner.  Also, some policies have accelerated death benefits which may be available if the insured is expected to die within six months to a year.&lt;ref&gt;Definition of life insurance by forum member mephistophles (Lee E. Marshall), a Chartered Life Underwriter (CLU)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of Life Insurance ==
Life insurance can broadly be divided into three general categories - "term", "permanent", and "group".  Term life insurance is usually intended for "temporary" insurance needs, such as insuring a family breadwinner while others are dependent on his/her income.  Permanent life insurance is usually intended for "lifetime" insurance needs or cash accumulation.  Group life insurance is usually provided through an employer or other association, as opposed to term and permanent which are sold to individuals.

* '''Term life insurance''' usually provides a level death benefit for a certain number of years, at a premium rate guaranteed for the term period.  For example, a typical 20 year term policy would provide a level death benefit, such as $1 million, for a period of 20 years, in exchange for a premium of $X per year.  Level term insurance is typically sold for periods of 10-30 years, with the most popular periods being 15 and 20 years.  (Note that a small number of term life insurance policies are sold with premiums that rise every year, 5 years, etc., and/or with death benefits that decrease over time.)  Most policies sold as "level term life insurance" actually continue beyond the initial premium guarantee period at a much higher premium, but the insured can lapse the policy at any time and is not obligated to pay the much higher "post-level" premium rate.
* '''Permanent life insurance''' provides a death benefit for the entirety of the insured's life.  There are several types of permanent life insurance, as follows:
** '''Whole life insurance''' has a premium and death benefit that is fixed and guaranteed to be level for life.  Because the chances of death increase as time goes on, the premiums paid in the early years are in excess of the probability of death, and therefore a "cash value" builds up within the policy over time.  The policyholder can typically access the cash value by surrendering the policy, which terminates the insurance coverage, and can also take out "policy loans" from the insurance company, based on the security of the cash value.  Most whole life policies are sold by "mutual" life insurance companies, and pay non-guaranteed "policyholder dividends" on an annual basis, which reduce the net cost of the whole life policy.  The policyholder dividends can be used to reduce future premium payments, purchase additional insurance coverage, or just accumulate within the policy.
** '''Universal life''' is the general name for several life insurance products that utilize an "account value", which is a notional account maintained by the insurance company.  Premiums paid by the policyholder are added to the account value (net of any premium loads).  Deductions from the account value are made by the insurance company, generally on a monthly basis, for cost of insurance charges, rider charges, and any other expense loads.  Additional credits to the account value are made with respect to interest or equity market returns on the account value.  A universal life policy generally remains in force as long as the account value is positive, and lapses if the account value drops to zero.  Most universal life products have "surrender charges" in the early durations of the policy, which reduce the amount available to the policyholder for loan or surrender.  The policyholder can access the account value (net of surrender charges) by fully surrendering the policy, which terminates the insurance coverage, by making a "partial surrender" of the account value, or by taking out a policy loan.   Within the general category of universal life, there are several distinct products as follows:
*** '''Traditional universal life''' (or just plain "universal life" or "UL") credits interest to the account value at a rate declared by the company.  The interest rate credited is guaranteed to not fall below a rate guaranteed in the policy (often 3%, but may be lower or higher).
*** '''Indexed universal life''' (often referred to as "IUL") credits interest to the account value based on the performance of an external index, such as the S&amp;P 500.  The interest credited is limited by "caps" and "participation rates" declared by the insurance company.  Usually, the interest credit is guaranteed to be not less than zero, even if the external index declines.
*** '''Guaranteed universal life''' (often referred to as "GUL") works similar to traditional universal life.  However, there is a "secondary guarantee" that the policy will not lapse, even if the account value falls below zero, so long as the premiums required by the policy are paid.  GUL policies typically build minimal or zero cash values, and are therefore less expensive per dollar of death benefit than other types of permanent life insurance.
*** '''Variable universal life''' (often referred to as "VUL") works similar to traditional universal life.  However, rather than having the account value invested in the general funds of the insurance company, it is invested in mutual funds chosen by the policyholder.  The account value can decline from year to year if the mutual funds decline in value.
* '''Group life insurance''' is a product usually offered through an employer.  It generally does not build cash values.  Amounts offered may be a flat amount (such as $50,000 of death benefit), or a percentage of salary (typically 1X or 2X salary, subject to a maximum amount).  Some employers offer additional amount of life insurance on a "voluntary" basis, often subject to individual underwriting.  Group life coverage typically ends when the employment relationship ends, but most plans allow the employee to "convert" to an individual life insurance policy, usually at an extremely high premium.  Many employers partially or fully pay the cost of group life insurance on their employees.  Group life insurance is also offered through professional organizations such as engineers or accountants, often at very attractive premium rates.  (See additional comments on group life insurance [[Life insurance#Further information on group life insurance|below]].)

== Purchasing individual life insurance ==
Most individual life insurance is sold through independent brokers or "tied" agents, while a few companies sell "direct to consumer".

* '''Independent brokers''' are "appointed" as agents for a number of life insurance companies, which allows them to submit applications for life insurance to the companies with which they are licensed. Such brokers often “shop” the coverage for a prospective insured to a number of different life insurers, trying to win the most favorable terms for their clients.  While most independent brokers operate in a limited geographic area, some have established internet websites to allow them to solicit clients nationwide.
* '''"Captive" agents''' primarily write life insurance for one life insurance company with which they are associated.  Often the insurance company provides such agents with training, office space, etc.  Such agents may also write a limited amount of business for other companies.  Most captive agents are affiliated either with mutual life insurance companies, or with company groups that write both property and casualty insurance (homeowners, auto, etc.) and life insurance.
* '''"Direct to consumer"''' sales use life insurance company employees who are also licensed as insurance agents to write applications for prospective policyholders.

Brokers and captive agents are usually compensated by commissions which are paid by the insurance company and whose cost is built into the pricing of the product. Life insurance commissions are generally “heaped” toward the first policy year, with renewal commissions at a much lower rate.

Depending on the amount of life insurance applied for and the age/health of the prospective insured, the life insurer might require a limited physical examination as a part of the application and underwriting process.  For younger insureds and lower face amounts, the insurer might rely solely upon a questionnaire and an examination of medical and prescription drug records.  Based on the underwriting review, the insurer will slot the applicant into a risk class, with lower premiums being charged to “better” risk classes.  Certain conditions, usually medical in nature, might cause the insurer to assess “substandard” premiums in excess of the standard quoted rate. The insurer also might decline to provide coverage to a prospective insured if the underwriting results are quite unfavorable.  Insurers may view underwriting conditions differently, so agents may consider multiple insurers so that they can find the best rate for prospective insureds.

By law, the rates for any specific life insurance policy are identical no matter how the policy is bought.  That is, the policy that is bought from "Company A", assuming the same specifications, will have the identical premium and terms whether you buy it through "Agent A", "Agent B", or any website.

Most life insurers have ratings from a firm called [https://web.ambest.com/home AM Best], which rates all insurance companies.  The majority of companies that are competitively active in writing life insurance have ratings from AM Best of A- or higher, which should be adequately conservative for all life insurance policies except the very largest, where the insured might choose to divide coverage between two or more companies. Other rating agencies that cover insurance companies include Fitch Ratings, Standard &amp; Poor's, and Moody’s, but not all life insurers have ratings from each of the agencies.

== Tax treatment of life insurance ==
Under US tax law, death benefits from all types of life insurance are generally not taxable income to the beneficiary.  Also, life insurance premiums are generally not a deductible expense.

For permanent life insurance policies, the growth in policy cash value is excluded from income, even though such growth may represent an increase in the policyholder's wealth.  Cash surrenders from a permanent life insurance policy are ordinary taxable income to the extent that the cash surrender amount is in excess of the "basis" of the policy (generally the cumulative premiums paid).  In the case of partial surrenders, amounts received are treated first as a return of basis, with tax owed only on additional surrenders in excess of basis.  Further, as with loans against most kinds of assets, loans secured by permanent life insurance policies are not treated as taxable income.

In some rare cases, a permanent life insurance policy may be classified as a "modified endowment contract" (MEC).  In those cases, partial surrenders are taxed as income until all gain in the policy has been removed, and only then are partial surrenders taxed as a return of basis.  Further, loans secured by modified endowment contracts are treated as surrenders or distributions.  Most policyholders and life insurers endeavor to avoid having policies classified as modified endowment contracts.

For US federal [[Estate and inheritance tax|estate and gift tax purposes]], which as of 2023 affects estates of single individuals in excess of $12.92 million, death benefit proceeds from life insurance policies are generally includable in the decedent’s gross estate and hence are generally subject to the estate tax.  Some families take steps to avoid this outcome, such as having other family members or specially designed “irrevocable life insurance trusts” own life insurance policies.

== Boglehead view of life insurance products ==
Based on observation of posts to the Boglehead Forum, following is the general view of Bogleheads on the topic of life insurance.

* '''Need for life insurance''' - Majority opinion is that life insurance is an appropriate financial tool for a person who has someone else dependent on their income and/or survival; for example, the breadwinner of a family or a parent caring for a child.  However, life insurance is not generally recommended for a person who has no one dependent on their income or survival; for example, a single person with no dependents, or a child.
* '''When is term life insurance appropriate''' - Majority opinion is that term life insurance is appropriate for the vast majority of life insurance needs, including, but not limited to:
** A family with young children might choose to insure the breadwinner(s) for a duration until the children are in college or on their own, to provide for the income that would be lost if the breadwinner were to die while the children are dependent.  
** A family might also choose to insure a non-working parent, reflecting the additional cost of childcare or reduced income from the other parent if the non-working parent were to die while the children are dependent.  
** A breadwinner might be insured to bridge to retirement, pension benefits, or Social Security availability for a non-working spouse.
** Note that some may choose to "ladder" term life insurance policies, purchasing (for example) both a 10 year and 20 year policy, to provide more insurance during the first 10 years and reduced coverage thereafter as needs change and the assets of the family increase.
* '''When is permanent life insurance appropriate''' - Majority opinion is that permanent life insurance is appropriate for only a relatively small subset of the population.  Such situations include, but are not limited to:
** Those who have children with special needs who (a) require an income supplement for the rest of their life and (b) are expected to live beyond their parent's death.
** Situations where liquid assets are needed when the insured dies.  Examples could include those who will owe estate taxes at their death and do not want to liquidate assets to pay the taxes, or to fund a buy-sell agreement in a closely held business.
** Individuals with very high incomes who live in high-tax states may find that the after-tax return on permanent life insurance is attractive compared to alternative fixed income investments.
** Note that the large commissions paid to agents generally make permanent life insurance a poor choice for short-term savings, due to surrender charges (on a universal life policy) or low early cash values (on a whole life policy).  But over a longer time horizon, the pre-tax performance of permanent life insurance (excluding variable universal life) will tend to be similar to conservative fixed-income investments.  Hence, savers with high income tax rates who have an asset allocation that includes fixed income may benefit from permanent life insurance.  Further note that equities held in a taxable brokerage account already have significant tax advantages, and therefore placing equities inside a variable universal life policy is generally not advisable.
* '''When is group life appropriate''' - Majority opinion is that an employee should elect any group life benefit that is offered for "free" by an employer.  Under US tax law, premiums for group life benefits of $50,000 or less are not taxable income to the employee.  However, majority opinion is that primary insurance coverage should generally be provided by an individual life policy, rather than a group policy, since the group life insurance will terminate when the employee leaves the employer.  (See additional comments on group life [[Life insurance#Further information on group life insurance|below]])

== Further information on group life insurance ==
Group life insurance premiums are typically based on the average mortality risk of all eligible members of the group, rather than being customized to the health of a particular insured.  An employee in good health can often find comparable coverage for a lower premium in the private market, making group insurance (in excess of any "free" amount provided by the employer) a relatively poor financial choice.  However, an employee who is at higher risk may find that group insurance is less expensive than insurance in the private market, and might weigh these savings against the risk of leaving the group and losing coverage (or having to pay the higher "conversion" premium). 

Some amount of group life insurance is often "guaranteed issue" to eligible members of the group.  For example, new employees may be guaranteed the right to purchase X times their salary in coverage during the first 30 days of employment.  This feature makes group insurance a useful option for insureds whose health makes them uninsurable in the private market.

==Determining family life insurance needs==

There are several ways to calculate your life insurance need, spanning a range of accuracy and complexity. 

===Income multiplier===

The simplest way to estimate life insurance need is to multiply income by some factor. Some sources suggest '''ten times''' annual income&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.investopedia.com/articles/pf/06/insureneeds.asp | title=How Much Life Insurance Should You Have?| publisher=Investopedia| accessdate=Feb 22, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;. As an alternative, you could assume a [[Safe withdrawal rates|safe withdrawal rate]] on the lump sum, likely in the 3-4% range, which would give a multiplier in the 25-33x range. This is likely a conservative estimate, as it assumes a very high probability that the principal will not be exhausted, when in reality it might be okay for the surviving spouse to draw the principal down.

When determining need for a non-working spouse, their "income" would be the cost to hire help to replace the work they do that would not be taken on by the surviving spouse.

===Worksheet method===

This worksheet assumes that both spouses are working and will continue to work if one partner dies prematurely.  Replacing 100% of your after-tax income may be a good starting place.  This should leave the survivor with the same standard of living.  Some expenses go down when one partner dies but other expenses, such as childcare, usually go up.

===Detailed plan===

The most accurate way to determine life insurance need is to create a detailed year-by-year plan for each spouse, assuming the other spouse passed away, from the present until a predicted date of financial independence. A complete plan would consider things like:

*the desired living situation and standard of living of the surviving family&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Due to the heavy emotional burden that will likely result from the death of a spouse and parent, it would be reasonable to plan for changing as few things as possible, including remaining in the family house and maintaining the same standard of living. Emotional trauma for children will likely be minimized if they can have the same home, school, friends, and activities. In some situations, it could make sense to plan specific changes, such as moving to be closer to relatives. It could also be reasonable to plan to curtail some luxury spending, such as buying less expensive cars, flying economy instead of business-class, or suspending expensive hobbies.&lt;/ref&gt;
*current available assets and debts, and the plans to tap them or pay them off
*the expected rate of return on invested assets, including the lump-sum life insurance payout 
*loss of income and non-paying work from the dying spouse, including loss of benefits (especially health insurance and retirement contributions)
*potential employment for the surviving spouse, which could include taking time off from current employment to deal with the loss, or seeking a job even if they do not have one now
*removal of expenses for the dying spouse - food, cars, hobbies, etc.
*final expenses - funeral, burial, etc.
*expected future expenses, such as higher education for children
*change in tax liability, including a change to [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/qualified-widow-or-widower.asp Qualified Widower] status for two years, then [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/head_of_household.asp Head of Household], and possibly Single later on 
*available Social Security survivor benefits&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.ssa.gov/pubs/EN-05-10084.pdf | title=Survivors Benefits| publisher=IRS| accessdate=Feb 22, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*the likelihood the surviving spouse would remarry (or whether this possibility should be considered at all)

===Rounding up===

Due to the uncertainties involved, low cost of term life, and likely negative consequences of a shortfall, standard financial advice is to generously round up both the amount of insurance and the term. For example, if your analysis says you should purchase $1.6M of coverage for a term of 24 years, a $2.0M 30-year would be prudent. Term policies can always be canceled early if your insurance need is gone before you planned. But if you are behind your plan for reasons that might or might not be under your control, purchasing more coverage later in life will likely be difficult and very expensive.

===Layering policies===

Most people's need for life insurance decreases over time, as they build assets, pay off debts, and put expenses behind them. Therefore, it may be a potential savings in premiums to ''layer'' several life insurance policies. For example, if you need $3M in life insurance today and expect to be financially independent in 30 years, you could purchase a $1M 20-year policy, a $1M 25-year policy, and a $1M 30-year policy. These three policies will likely be cheaper than a single $3M 30-year policy. The cost savings may or may not be worth the added complexity. Also consider that some expenses the policy is meant to cover, especially higher education for children, may be weighted toward the end of the term. 

Buying policies at different insurers can provide diversification against insolvency at any one insurer.

==Locating a lost policy==
If you’ve lost a loved one, determining if a life insurance exists, or obtaining the details of an existing policy, may be difficult. Here are a few suggestions:
* '''Search personal records:''' Look through files, safe deposit boxes and other areas where your loved one might have kept insurance documents.&lt;ref name="insure"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.insure.com/life-insurance/lost-policies.html|title=How to find lost life insurance policies |format= |page=|publisher=Insure.com|date = December 19, 2019|accessdate=28 Jan 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;
**If the policy is not evident, try to find the name of the life insurance company that issued the policy. For clues, go through bank and credit card statements to look for evidence of premium payments made to an insurance company.&lt;ref name="iii"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iii.org/article/how-can-i-locate-lost-life-insurance-policy|title=12 steps for locating a lost life insurance policy|format=|page=|publisher=Insurance Information Institute, Inc.|accessdate=28 Jan 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Contact financial advisors:''' Present or prior attorneys, accountants, investment advisors, bankers, business insurance agents/brokers and other financial professionals might have information about the deceased’s life insurance policies.&lt;ref name="iii" /&gt;
* '''Check with employers:''' Contact the employee benefits administrators of your relative's former employers to see if any group life insurance policies are still in effect or if your loved one purchased additional voluntary coverage at work.&lt;ref name="insure" /&gt;
* '''Check the mail:''' Look for premium notices or dividend notices. If a policy has been paid up, there will no notice of premium payments due; however, the company may still send an annual notice regarding the status of the policy or notice of a dividend.&lt;ref name="iii" /&gt;
* '''Review income tax returns:''' Life insurance companies pay interest on accumulations on permanent policies and charge interest on policy loans.&lt;ref name="iii" /&gt;

Insurance companies will assist you to locate a lost policy. All you need is the name of the insurer that issued the policy; from there you can contact the insurer to start a claim, even if you don’t know the policy number. A list of policy locators is in the section [[#Lost policy finders|below]].

If you are unsure a policy exists, or you don’t know the name of the insurance company, the NAIC (National Association of Insurance Commissioners) provides a free policy locator that will place inquiries with participating companies. Start here: [https://eapps.naic.org/life-policy-locator/#/welcome Life Insurance Policy Locator Service]

Insurance companies are obligated to find policy beneficiaries. If no beneficiaries are found, they are required by law to turn unclaimed funds over to the state (called "escheatment").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.metlife.com/policyfinder/|title=Policy Finder |format= |page=|publisher=Metropolitan Life Insurance Company|date = |accessdate=28 Jan 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The unclaimed funds are turned over into your state's unclaimed property division. Insurance companies turn policy proceeds over to these divisions when they know the insured person has died but can't find the beneficiary. The National Association of Unclaimed Property Administrators website provides links to unclaimed property divisions in each state. See: [https://unclaimed.org/search-for-your-unclaimed-property-its-free/ Search for your unclaimed property]&lt;ref name="insure" /&gt;
