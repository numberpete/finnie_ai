You might purchase shares of a fund at different prices at different times in a taxable account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-publication-550| title=About Publication 550, Investment Income and Expenses| publisher=IRS| accessdate=August 4, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IRS allows you to use several different accounting methods for calculating your cost basis for the shares sold. '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is the method which usually gives the lowest tax bills. For more details on the other methods, see: [[Cost basis methods]].

'''Note''': Specific identification of shares and other cost basis methods are only relevant for taxable accounts. They are not applicable to tax deferred or tax free accounts.

==Execution==

Treasury regulations section [https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CFR-2014-title26-vol11/pdf/CFR-2014-title26-vol11-sec1-1012-1.pdf 1.1012-1(c)(1)] permits taxpayers to use specific identification if they can make "adequate identification" of the shares sold. Otherwise, they are required to use FIFO, or, for mutual funds, average basis.

===At Vanguard===
Vanguard Brokerage Services requires you to choose a preferred cost basis method for each individual security you own in a taxable account. The default choice is FIFO (first-in, first-out). Your options are FIFO, MinTax (most favorable tax rate), or HIFO (highest-in, first-out). AvgCost is also an option for mutual funds. (Note: SpecID used to be an option but Vanguard removed it; see {{Forum link|t=454409|title=&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;Vanguard email about selecting automatic cost basis&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;}} for a discussion.)

You can override the preferred method and use Specific ID on each sale order but you must remember to do so and also select which specific lots to include. Otherwise Vanguard will automatically assign shares to your sale order according to the rules of your preferred method.

If you sell non-covered shares, there will be only one lot listed (even if you purchased multiple lots), and you will have to identify the shares in a secure Email. If you write a letter to Vanguard to make the sale, you also need to identify the shares in your letter. Vanguard requests that you include the following information (quoted from a Vanguard form letter):
* Your name.
* Your address.
* The last four digits of your Social Security number.
* The Vanguard(R) fund and account number from which you're redeeming or exchanging shares.
* The share amount to be redeemed or exchanged.
* Whether the shares were redeemed or exchanged.
* The specific date(s) on which the shares were originally purchased.
* The number of shares purchased on each date.
* The net asset value (NAV) on the date the shares were purchased.
If you sell shares online, send a secure Email on the same day with this information; if you sell by mail, include this information in your letter.

===General rules===
====Identification by standing order====

Treasury regulation [https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2010-10-18/pdf/2010-25504.pdf section 1.1012-1(c)(8)] clarifies that the investor may give a standing order to the broker, such as, "Always sell the highest-cost shares" (which usually minimizes taxes) or "Always sell the lowest-cost shares" (which might be chosen by an investor in an unusually low tax bracket for one year); this will constitute specific identification if the broker acknowledges the transactions. (This is what Vanguard Brokerage allows investors to do, specifying highest-in-first-out.)

====Identification at the time of trade and confirmation====

Treasury regulations section [https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CFR-2014-title26-vol11/pdf/CFR-2014-title26-vol11-sec1-1012-1.pdf 1.1012-1(c)(3)(i)] says that if the investor tells the broker or other agent holding the shares which specific shares are being sold at the time of the sale, and the investor receives written confirmation back from the broker within a reasonable time, then "adequate identification" has been made and so specific identification is available. [https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2010-10-18/pdf/2010-25504.pdf Section 1.1012-1(c)(8)] clarifies that "at the time of the sale" requires the identification to be made by the settlement date, which is two days after the date of sale for most stock purchases but is the next day for most mutual fund trades.

====Adequate identification by other methods====

Nothing in the regulation says that informing the broker and getting confirmation is ''required'' in order to have "adequate identification," just that it is one type of adequate identification. The Treasury regulations clarify two procedures which the IRS had accepted in previous rulings, identifying the specific sales by settlement date and making a standing order.

==Advantage==

The advantage of specific identification is that you can choose the shares to minimize your gains, maximize your losses, or realize long-term rather than short-term gains. The savings are valuable when you need to sell, and specific identification also makes it much more likely that [[Tax loss harvesting | tax loss harvesting]] will be possible.

For example, suppose you have 3,000 shares of a fund, purchased at prices between $20 and $40 over a long period; your total investment was $90,000, so your average purchase price is $30. Your most recent purchase, made last year, was 250 shares at $40. You now want to sell 250 shares at a price of $40. If you use first-in-first-out accounting (the IRS default), you sell the first 250 shares you purchased, which have a basis of $20, so your taxable capital gain is $5,000. If you use average-cost accounting (using the information provided by Vanguard), your basis in the shares is $30 a share, so your taxable capital gain is $2,500. If you use specific identification, you can choose to sell the shares bought last year, which have a basis of $40 a share, so your taxable capital gain is zero.

Similarly, suppose that you hold the same shares, and the fund has dropped in value to $30 a share. If you use specific identification, you can choose to sell the shares bought last year for $40, claiming a $2,500 capital loss. If you do not use specific identification, you cannot harvest any loss; any sales will be of shares with an average price of $30 and thus no loss.

==Disadvantage==

While specific identification of shares is the most favorable method for tax purposes, it does impose an extra record-keeping burden. Specifically, if you have your fund company or brokerage that does not provide a good user interface for selling specific shares (such as Vanguard with "non-covered" mutual fund shares purchased before 2012), you have to personally keep track of tax lots, where a tax lot consists of the purchase date, the purchase price, and the number of shares. As you sell specific shares, you have to update the number of shares remaining in a tax lot that you sell shares from.

==Operational tips==

You might want to employ the following techniques to alleviate the record keeping burden of specific identification of shares, or to determine whether it is worthwhile

* You may consider not automatically reinvesting dividends and capital gains distributions, in order to reduce the number of tax lots you will have to keep track of. See [[Reinvesting dividends in a taxable account]] for details.
* While it is possible to sell a part of a given tax lot, some people sell an entire tax lot to simplify the cost basis accounting. For example, if you've bought 100 shares of a fund in the past, you might consider selling all of the 100 shares, essentially crossing off the tax lot completely.
* You may consider the following and possibly other methods to keep track of tax lots and pick one that works for you:
** Use paper and pencil.
** Develop and maintain a custom spreadsheet with [https://office.microsoft.com/en-us/excel/default.aspx Microsoft Excel] or [https://www.openoffice.org/product/calc.html OpenOffice.org Calc].
** Use personal finance software packages, such as [https://www.microsoft.com/Money/default.mspx Microsoft Money] (no longer active) and [https://www.quicken.com/ Quicken].
** Use a brokerage that supports specific identification of shares, such as [[Fidelity]].
* If you are not planning to [[Tax loss harvesting | tax loss harvest]], and your average holding period is fairly short, average cost basis may not be very disadvantageous compared to specific identification of shares because there is no big disparity in cost basis among shares you hold. Although your results may vary, the difference between the two cost basis methods may be small in the following cases:
** The fund is a bond fund, so its share price does not vary significantly. (You might use specific identification only in your stock funds.)
** You are in a very low tax bracket for your capital gains.
** All or the vast majority of your taxable assets were purchased in a short time period (such as a catch-up just before retirement, or a windfall)
** You sell all or the vast majority of your taxable holdings late in the accumulation phase and buy other funds (possibly because you switch to low-cost index funds from expensive and/or tax-inefficient actively managed funds).

      <text bytes="7334" sha1="dkxue5y73xvq7lzubeqe9zcs5srglol" xml:space="preserve">{{US|reason=irrelevant}}In the U.S. a '''qualified dividend''' is a type of dividend to which capital gains tax rates are applied. These tax rates are usually lower than regular income tax rates. In contrast, ordinary dividends that do not qualify for this tax preference are taxed at your normal income tax rate.&lt;ref name="Investopedia"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/qualifieddividend.asp| title=Qualified Dividend| publisher=Investopedia| accessdate=March 10, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Qualified dividends were enacted in the The Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003. The Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act of 2005, extended the low qualified dividend tax rates until the end of 2010. The Tax Relief Act enacted in December 2010 extended qualified dividends through 2012. The American Taxpayer Relief Act (ATRA) extended qualified dividends for the years beyond 2012.

Qualified dividends must meet the following requirements:&lt;ref name="Investopedia"/&gt;
* The dividend must have been paid by an American company or a qualifying foreign company.
* The dividends are not listed with the IRS as dividends that do not qualify.
* The required dividend holding period has been met, usually 61 days including the dividend date.&lt;ref group="note"&gt; 
For a summary determining qualified dividend holding periods, refer to: [https://www.fidelity.com/tax-information/tax-topics/qualified-dividends Fidelity: Qualified Dividends]. Additional restrictions are given in [https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/26/1.246-5 IRS Regulations-246.5]. Any day that you have a position on "substantially similar or related property" which diminishes your risk of loss, does not count as part of the holding period. The most common situation in which this would apply is holding an option to sell (put), or writing an option to buy (call) which is not "substantially out of the money."&lt;/ref&gt;

The fraction of dividend distributions from a mutual fund or ETF which are qualified is the same fraction as the qualified dividends are of the income the fund received. However, if at least 95% of the fund's income was from qualified dividends, it can report the dividend as 100% qualified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/854| title=26 U.S. Code § 854 - Limitations applicable to dividends received from regulated investment company| publisher=Cornell Law School| accessdate=March 10, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tax rates==

Mutual fund distributions will be taxed according to the tax laws governing the investment over the holding period of the investment, which are subject to change. The actual tax imposed will depend on your tax rate and the timing of purchases and sales. The federal tax rates applicable to mutual fund distributions and investor sales of securities for the period 2018 onward are outlined below. Keep in mind that investment income may also be subject to state and local taxation. 

Short-term capital gains distributions are made from realized gains on securities held for one year or less. Short-term gains are taxed at ordinary income tax rates. Mutual fund short-term gain distributions are included in a fund's [[Ordinary dividend | ordinary dividend]] distribution; therefore, capital losses may not be subtracted from these distributions when computing taxes.

[[Capital gains distribution |Long-term capital gains distributions]] are made from realized gains on securities held for more than one year. They are reported on tax Schedule D along with any other capital gains, and can be reduced by capital losses.

[[Qualified dividend]]s are the ordinary dividends&lt;ref group="note"&gt;''[https://fairmark.com/investment-taxation/mutual-fund-tax-guide/ordinary-dividends/ Fairmark]'' says:
{{quotation|A portion of your [[Ordinary dividend | ordinary dividend]] may be nonqualified because it can include items like these:

'''Taxable interest'''. When a mutual fund receives taxable interest, the income gets paid out as a dividend. It's a dividend when it goes out of the mutual fund, but it wasn't a dividend when it came into the mutual fund, so it can't be a qualified dividend.

'''Nonqualified dividends'''. Your mutual fund may receive dividends that are nonqualified. For example, the mutual fund may sell shares just 35 days after buying them, but after receiving a dividend. The mutual fund has to hold the shares at least 61 days to have a qualified dividend. Any amount the mutual fund receives as a nonqualified dividend gets paid to you as a nonqualified dividend.

'''Short-term capital gain'''. When a mutual fund has a short-term capital gain, it pays this amount to the mutual fund shareholders as an ordinary dividend.

'''Holding mutual fund shares less than 61 days'''. You should also be aware that any dividend you receive on mutual fund shares held less than 61 days is a nonqualified dividend, even if the mutual fund reports that amount to you as a qualified dividend. You don't have to buy the shares 61 days before the dividend is paid, but the total amount of time you hold the shares (including time before and after the dividend) has to be at least 61 days.|Fairmark}}
Almost all of the dividends distributed by [[REIT |Equity REITS]] come in the form of non-qualified dividends. Non-qualified dividends are taxed at marginal income tax rates. 
&lt;/ref&gt; that are subject to the same tax rate that applies to long-term capital gains. They should be shown in box 1b of the Form 1099-DIV you receive. 

[[Tax loss harvesting | When you sell at a loss]] you will either offset capital gains which would have otherwise been taxed at your capital gains rate or you will offset income (up to $3,000 maximum per year) which would have otherwise been taxed at your marginal income tax rate, or both. If you offset capital gains that would have otherwise not been taxed at all (because your capital gains tax rate is 0%) then this part of the tax loss harvest may be an outright loss.

The Affordable Care Act imposes a Medicare surcharge of 3.8% on all net investment income (NII) once the taxpayer's adjusted gross income exceeds $200,000 (single) or $250,000 (married); while this tax is not part of the income tax, it has the same effect on investors as a higher tax rate. 
{{trim|{{TaxRateTable}}}}

Qualified dividends are the ordinary dividends that are subject to the same rate that applies to net capital gains. They should be shown in box 1b of the Form 1099-DIV you receive from a brokerage firm or mutual fund company. The qualified dividend tax rates are 0%, 15%, and beginning in 2013, a 20% maximum tax.

If you are subject to the [[ACA net investment income tax|Net Investment Income (NII) tax]], a 3.8% surtax for taxpayers whose adjusted gross income surpasses threshold limits,&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The threshold amounts triggering the NII tax are $250,000 for married filing jointly/surviving spouse with dependents; $200,000 for single/head of household; and $125,000 for married filing separately. The threshold amounts are not indexed to inflation. &lt;/ref&gt; your qualified dividend tax rate will increase to 18.8% or 23.8% depending on your marginal tax bracket.

{{Notice |This page was created prior to the 2018 TCJA tax law. The examples below use tax rates applicable in 2017.}}

'''{{PAGENAME}}''', as opposed to [[Tax loss harvesting | tax-loss harvesting]], is the process of turning unrealized long-term capital gains into realized capital gains at a specific time for tax purposes.

==Overview==
In general, it is considered advantageous to delay the realization of capital gains as long as possible.  Consequently, tax-gain harvesting is often counter-intuitive and less frequently discussed.

Under the assumption that they may have more taxable income in future years, an investor might accelerate long-term capital gains. They might do so:&lt;ref&gt;Refer to [[Capital gains distribution]].&lt;/ref&gt;
*Up to the top of the 0% long term capital gains tax bracket, that is currently close to the top of the 12% ordinary income bracket.
*Up to the top of the [[ACA net investment income tax|ACA Net Investment Income (NII) tax]] threshold for their filing status, in order to avoid paying the 3.8% surtax in future years.

Consider the following scenario:

#In 2009, Alice and Bob buy 10 shares of Fund A for $100/share.  Each has $1,000 basis in the fund.
#In 2012, Fund A is worth $200/share.  Alice sells her shares of Fund A, realizing a $1,000 capital gain.  Because Alice was in the 0% long term capital gain tax bracket at that time, she owed no taxes on this gain.  The next day, she repurchases 10 shares of Fund A at the same price (the '[[wash sale]]' rule does not apply).
#In 2014, Alice and Bob were in the 25% tax bracket (15% long term capital gains tax) and sold their shares. Fund A was worth $250/share. Alice realized another $500 gain, incurring $75 in taxes. Bob realized a $1,500 capital gain, incurring $225 in taxes.

Bob incurred triple the taxes on the same capital gain by not tax-gain harvesting.

==Fine points about tax gain harvesting==
===Regulatory===
*[[Wash sale]]: The "wash sale rule" does not apply to tax-gain harvesting. The definition of a wash sale specifically applies it only to securities sold at a loss; securities sold at a profit may immediately be repurchased without tax consequences.
*'''Qualified dividends:''' If you hold shares less than 61 days and receive qualified dividends from those shares, they are not qualified dividends even though the fund company may claim to be qualified dividends. See [http://www.fairmark.com/mutual/ordinary.htm Mutual Fund Ordinary Dividends] for more details. Disqualification of qualified dividends may outweigh the benefit of tax gain harvesting in some cases.

===Operational===
*'''Offsetting with capital losses:''' Carryover losses, and losses realized during the year, must be used to offset realized gains. The tax benefits of these losses may outweigh the benefits from harvesting gains.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The benefits of ''Tax Loss Harvesting'' followed by ''Tax Gain Harvesting'' (in a later year) are in opposition; they tend to cancel each other out. This does not preclude an investor with carryover losses from ''Tax Gain Harvesting'', but it does raise a red flag for further investigation.
&lt;br&gt;
Conversely, if ''Tax Gain Harvesting'' is followed by ''Tax Loss Harvesting'' (with no prior carryover losses), both strategies are working in concert. After ''Tax Gain Harvesting,'' you've raised your cost basis; which makes it easier to harvest losses later. And later losses may be worth more, if your tax bracket or Long Term Capital Gains tax rate is higher.
&lt;br&gt;
See: [http://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&amp;t=121568&amp;p=1778037#p1779535 Re: Post-2012 tax gain harvesting], direct link to post.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Tax planning:''' Use tax software or a tax calculator to do "what-if" calculations. Because of the various interactions of the income components and easy-to-make assumptions (incorrect), it is easy to go wrong here if concepts are incorrect; as evidenced by the situations [[#When not to harvest gains | below]].&lt;ref&gt;Forum discussion: [http://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=1779222#p1779222 Re: Post-2012 tax gain harvesting], direct link to post.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Partial harvesting:''' If you can only harvest gains on part of your holdings, it is best to harvest gains on the shares with the lowest gains.  This gives you more shares with the new, higher basis, and thus more shares which can be sold for reduced gains (if the price rises) or to harvest a loss (if the price falls in a future year). By doing so you are creating a larger cost basis gap between your low basis shares and your high basis shares, even though the total basis remains the same, potentially deferring more capital gains from the low basis shares to the future. The lowest basis shares can be donated to charity or receive a step-up in basis when the taxpayer dies.

==When not to harvest gains==
* '''Income tax rate:''' The lower capital gains rate only applies to taxpayers who are in the 12% (15%) bracket even when the amount of the capital gain is included.  A taxpayer with $20,000 in taxable income and $100,000 in unrealized gains would provoke a substantial tax bill by attempting to tax-gain harvest the full amount of their capital gains.
* '''State taxes:''' If you pay state taxes now to harvest a capital gain, you lose the future growth on that amount.  For a long-term investment, you may lose more by not being able to invest the state tax than you save by avoiding federal tax.  For example, with a 5% state tax rate, a $1000 harvest costs $50 in state tax, and that $50 could grow to more than the $200 you would owe in state and federal tax if you sell in a higher bracket many years later.
*'''Adjusted Gross Income:''' To the extent that gain realization will increase reported adjusted gross income (AGI), the higher AGI can reduce available itemized deductions. Certain itemized deductions have percentage AGI thresholds, such as medical expense deductions (greater than 10% AGI), that will be reduced by a higher AGI.
*'''Social Security:'''  If you are receiving Social Security benefits, any realized capital gain may increase the amount of your Social Security that is taxed.  Even if you pay no tax on the gain itself, a $1000 gain may cause $850 of Social Security to be taxed at 12% (15%), a 10.2% (12.75%) tax rate.   As more of your Social Security becomes taxable, there is also the possibility that all or part of the capital gain would be pushed into a higher tax bracket.  In some cases, this can result in a marginal tax rate of 40.7% (47.5%).&lt;ref group="note"&gt; See [[Taxation of Social Security benefits]].&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Saver's Credit:''' Capital gains might cause you to not qualify for the [[Saver's credit|retirement savings credit]]. Prepare a dummy tax return (including a state tax return) to check for impacts.&lt;ref&gt;Forum discussion: [http://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=1&amp;t=121061&amp;p=1771193#p1771193 Re: Help with selling stocks in 15% bracket], direct link to post.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an issue facing investors holding assets in [[Asset allocation in multiple accounts|multiple accounts]], both tax-advantaged and taxable accounts. The tax code recognizes different sources of investment income which are taxed at different rates, or, are taxed at a later time (tax "deferred"). An asset's tax efficiency (the impact of taxes on an investment) is affected by both its expected return and the tax rate on that return.

Some fund types, like total market stock index funds, are extremely tax-efficient, because they produce low dividends (that are mostly [[qualified dividend|qualified]]) and capital gains. By contrast, bond funds can be extremely tax-inefficient, because the interest they produce every year is taxed at your full marginal tax rate. Other tax-inefficient investments are REITs, small value funds, and actively managed funds that frequently churn their holdings. Put tax-inefficient funds into tax-advantaged accounts to the extent possible.

All investors must pay their legally required taxes. This article describes how to minimize taxes by placing investments appropriately in tax-deferred or taxable (pay taxes now) accounts.
{{Warning|Determining your [[Asset allocation|asset allocation]] (% stocks / % bonds), which sets your portfolio's level of [[Risk#Asset Allocation | acceptable risk]], ''is the single most influential decision you can make'' on your portfolio's performance. Only consider taxes &lt;u&gt;after&lt;/u&gt; you have configured your total portfolio.}}{{Notice|Tax regulations can be complex and contain subtle details that may escape inexperienced investors. If this article seems overly complicated, then just remember a few key points:
*Set your asset allocation first; taxes come second. If you do not have any funds which can be put in a location to reduce your tax bill, then stop here. You have done the best you can.
*Tax rates and brackets change frequently. What was a logical tax location one year may turn out to be a poor choice a few years later. Consider if it is worth the effort (added complexity) to take this approach.
*Consider the [[#Criticisms_of_this_tax_placement_strategy|various criticisms]] of the suggested tax placement strategy.}}

==General strategy==
Because tax regulations are complex, and there are a lot of possible investment scenarios, the suggestions in this article do not apply to everyone. While there is no "one rule fits all" concept, the strategies here are mostly aimed at investors in the accumulation phase (saving for retirement).

In considering '''asset location''' keep the following points in mind:

*If your investments are &lt;u&gt;all&lt;/u&gt; in tax-advantaged accounts, fund placement will not have a large impact on your returns. ''Tax-advantaged'' accounts include tax-deferred accounts, such as traditional [[401(k)]], [[403(b)]], and [[Traditional IRA]], and the tax-free Roth versions of those accounts such as [[Roth IRA]].
*If you have a taxable account, first consider whether it is better to move the money into a tax-advantaged account by contributing more to a tax-advantaged account.
*If you are already contributing the maximum to every tax-advantaged account available to you, and you have additional funds to invest, you need to consider tax efficiency when choosing your funds.
*You should always establish an [[Emergency fund | emergency fund]] first, and then fund your work-based retirement account, HSA, or IRA ''before'' your taxable accounts. Tax-advantaged accounts are the most tax-efficient accounts, and you should not overlook them.

See [[Prioritizing investments]] for more on the points above.

If you have both tax-advantaged (retirement) and taxable accounts, you generally want to hold less tax-efficient assets in a tax-advantaged account and more tax-efficient assets in a taxable account. You need to consider both the return and the tax rate. With higher bond yields, conventional wisdom is to hold bonds in tax-advantaged accounts. Today low yields are common, and a bond fund with an expected return of less than 1% can be more tax efficient than a stock fund with an expected return of 7% even though the bond fund's return is taxed at a higher rate. It is best to understand the basic principles and then apply them to your situation.

===Advantages of taxable accounts===
The advantages for holding stocks in a taxable account include:

* Lower tax rates. In tax-advantaged accounts, all investments are taxed equally (not at all in a tax-free account, or only on withdrawal in a tax-deferred account). In taxable accounts, almost all the return on bonds are taxed at your full rate every year, but most of the return on stocks is tax-favored:
** Increases in stock prices do not lead to any tax until the stocks are sold, which offers an additional way for you to defer taxes.
** When you sell stocks, the tax is usually at the lower rate for long-term capital gains.
** If the stocks pay dividends, they are taxed every year, but [[Qualified dividend|qualified dividends]] are taxed at a lower rate.
* You can [[Tax loss harvesting | harvest losses]].
* You can [[Donating appreciated securities | donate appreciated shares]] to charity, avoiding all taxes.
* Estate planning; there is a potential for [[Step-up in basis|stepped-up cost basis]] upon death.

For example, suppose that you hold $10,000 in a stock index fund for 30 years, and it yields 2%, all qualified dividends are taxed at 15%, while earning 6% in increased stock prices for a pre-tax return of 8%. Every year, you pay 0.30% tax on the dividend, and reinvest the other 1.7%. After 30 years, you have $92,570, with a basis of $28,230 including reinvested dividends.

When you sell, you pay $9,651 tax on the $64,340 capital gain, for a final value of $82,719, an annual return of 7.30%. Despite the 15% tax rate, your returns were only 9% less than the tax-free rate because you deferred taxes on the capital gains. If you harvested losses, donated some of the stock to charity, or left some to your heirs, your return would be even higher.

The advantages for holding bonds in a taxable account include:

* Bonds have a lower expected return than stocks, and so sometimes a lower tax cost.
* Switching placement when necessary does not incur a large capital gains tax. If you hold stocks in a taxable account instead, large built-up unrealized capital gains makes it very difficult for you to switch, even if switching would otherwise be beneficial.
* Nominal [[Treasury bonds|treasury bonds]], [[TIPS]], and in-state [[Municipal bonds|muni bonds]] are not subject to the state income tax.
* The effective tax rate on muni bonds is usually much lower than the highest marginal tax rate on ordinary income.
* Interest from muni bonds is not included in Adjusted Gross Income (AGI), which determines eligibility for many income tax deductions and credits, whereas dividends and capital gains are included in AGI.

===Tax rates===
Tax rates are shown below:&lt;ref group="note"&gt; Mutual fund distributions and the tax consequences of selling funds are explained below:
*Short-term capital gains distributions are realized gains on securities held for one year or less. Your short-term gains are taxed at ordinary income tax rates. Mutual fund short-term gain distributions are included in a fund's [[Ordinary dividend | ordinary dividend]] distribution; therefore, capital losses may not be subtracted from these distributions when computing taxes.
*[[Capital gains distribution |Long-term capital gains distributions]] are realized gains on securities held for more than one year. You report these on tax Schedule D along with any other capital gains, and can offset them with capital losses.
*[[Qualified dividend]]s are the ordinary dividends.

A portion of your [[Ordinary dividend | ordinary dividend]] may be nonqualified because it can include items like these:
*'''Taxable interest'''. When a mutual fund receives taxable interest, the income gets paid out as a dividend. It is a dividend when it goes out of the mutual fund, but it was not a dividend when it came into the mutual fund, so it cannot be a qualified dividend.
*'''Nonqualified dividends'''. Your mutual fund may receive dividends that are nonqualified. For example, the mutual fund may sell shares just 35 days after buying them, but after receiving a dividend. The mutual fund has to hold the shares at least 61 days to have a qualified dividend. Any amount the mutual fund receives as a nonqualified dividend gets paid to you as a nonqualified dividend.
*'''Short-term capital gain'''. When a mutual fund has a short-term capital gain, it pays this amount to the mutual fund shareholders as an ordinary dividend.
*'''Holding mutual fund shares less than 61 days'''. Any dividend you receive on mutual fund shares held less than 61 days is a nonqualified dividend, even if the mutual fund reports that amount to you as a qualified dividend. You do not have to buy the shares 61 days before the dividend is paid, but the total amount of time you hold the shares (including time before and after the dividend) has to be at least 61 days.

Almost all of the dividends distributed by [[REIT |equity REITS]] come in the form of non-qualified dividends. Non-qualified dividends are taxed at marginal income tax rates.

*[[Tax loss harvesting | When you sell at a loss]] you will either offset capital gains which would have otherwise been taxed at your capital gains rate or you will offset income (up to $3,000 maximum per year) which would have otherwise been taxed at your marginal income tax rate, or both. If you offset capital gains that would have otherwise not been taxed at all (because your capital gains tax rate is 0%) then this part of the tax loss harvest may be an outright loss.
*The [[ACA net investment income tax|Affordable Care Act]] imposes a Medicare surcharge of 3.8% on all net investment income (NII) once the taxpayer's adjusted gross income exceeds $200,000 (single) or $250,000 (married); while this tax is not part of the income tax, it has the same effect on investors as a higher tax rate.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tax efficiency of various asset classes ==
The table below shows the ''approximate'' tax efficiency ranking of various asset class funds.

Given reasonable assumptions, the "Very inefficient", "Moderately inefficient" , and "Efficient" categories separate fairly clearly. The exact ordering within the categories depends not only on future tax policy, but also on assumptions about turnover, future returns, dividend yields, and qualified dividends.

A more complete discussion of bonds and bond funds, balanced funds, and stocks and stock funds follows.

See {{Forum link|t=242137| title=2017 Relative Tax Efficiency}} for specific examples of several mutual funds and ETFs.

||'''Notes:'''
*Tax exempt [[municipal bonds]] and [[Tax-managed fund comparison|Vanguard tax-managed funds]] are only suitable for taxable accounts.
*While this article considers tax efficient fund placement, note that savings bonds ([[EE savings bonds |series EE]] and[[ I savings bonds | series I]])&lt;ref group="note"&gt; Interest from EE and I Bonds accumulates tax-deferred for up to 30 years; may be tax free for qualifying educational expenses; and when taxed, is free from state and local income tax.&lt;/ref&gt; are only available in taxable accounts.
|}
====Tax efficiency of bonds====
Some investors see bonds or bond funds as tax-inefficient because almost all of the return comes from the dividend yield, which is fully taxed as ordinary income.&lt;ref group="note"&gt; Most bond funds also periodically distribute modest amounts of short term and long term gains.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, stocks get most of their return from price appreciation, which is not taxed until the stocks are sold and is taxed at the capital-gains tax rate. Therefore, these investors regard bonds as being less tax-efficient than stock index funds (which rarely sell stock) and hold bonds in tax-advantaged accounts when possible.

However, low-yielding bonds do not have much return to be taxed, and because they do not grow as fast as other investments, an equal percentage lost from an investment is a smaller dollar loss; this makes low-yielding bonds somewhat more tax-efficient. Therefore, some other investors do just the opposite: they hold stocks with a higher expected return in tax-advantaged accounts when possible. You have to strike a balance between the expected return and the tax rate.

[[Treasury bonds]] are exempt from state taxes, making them tax-inefficient for federal taxes, but they may be desirable taxable investments for investors who pay high state taxes but low federal taxes. [[TIPS]] have the same tax-efficiency as their treasury bond equivalents; however, because you need to pay taxes annually on the inflation component, and you do not receive this until the bond matures or is sold, this cash flow problem creates an additional reason to hold individual TIPS (as opposed to a fund) in a tax-advantaged account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.projectinvested.com/investor-guides/investorsguide-to-u-s-treasury-securities/| title=Investor's Guide to U.S. Treasury Securities| publisher=project:invested| accessdate=June 5, 2023}} &lt;/ref&gt;

[[Municipal bonds|Municipal bond]] funds have a hidden cost; while their interest incomes are not subject to federal tax, they usually earn less than [[Corporate bonds|corporate]] or treasury bond funds of comparable risk. (The risk may be of a different type; intermediate-term municipal bonds have more credit risk than long-term treasury bonds, but less interest-rate risk, and thus may have a similar after-tax yield.) There are special rules regarding the taxation of [[Social Security]] benefits - municipal bond interest in a taxable account may result in additional [[Taxation of Social Security benefits|Social Security benefits being taxable]].&lt;ref group="note"&gt; For a general guide to the taxation of municipal bonds, see [https://www.projectinvested.com/investor-guides/investors-guide-to-municipal-bonds/ Investor's Guide to Municipal Bonds], project:invested. Some municipal securities, including Build America Bonds, are taxable bonds. Interest income from Private activity municipal securities (and mutual funds that invest in them) is subject to the federal alternative minimum tax if the taxpayer is required to pay this tax.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tax efficiency of balanced funds====
[[Balanced fund|Balanced funds]] (stocks and bonds) are very popular among individual investors. These funds hold a variety of asset classes in one simple fund instead of several. They have a variety of names such as balanced, [[Vanguard LifeStrategy funds|lifestyle]], or [[Target date retirement funds|target retirement funds]]. Since these funds include both stocks and bonds their tax efficiency sits somewhere between stocks and bonds.

If you have a balanced fund in a taxable account, you cannot sell only the bonds (to hold bonds in a different account, or to hold fewer bonds, or to hold a different type of bonds); you have to sell the whole fund, which can result in realizing a capital gain.

In a taxable account, you pay tax on the bond dividends at ordinary income rates; in addition, you lose the option to harvest losses of individual asset classes. The more efficient strategy is to own the individual asset classes in separate funds and in their most tax-efficient locations.

====Tax efficiency of stocks====
Stock funds can be tax-inefficient if they generate a lot of capital gains, particularly short-term gains. They are also less efficient if they pay high dividends (although under current tax law, if most of the dividend stream is a [[Qualified dividend | "qualified" dividend]], the tax burden is reduced.) Actively managed stock funds with high turnover sell most of their stocks with gains, generating large taxable gains. Even low-turnover active funds tend to generate more gains than index funds in the same asset class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author1=Clemens Sialm| author2=Hanjiang Zhang| url=https://ssrn.com/abstract=2368625| title=Tax Efficient Asset Management: Evidence from Equity Mutual Funds| date=December 16, 2013}} Available at SSRN. &lt;/ref&gt;

[[Indexing|Index funds]] must also sell stocks which leave the index. Because both [[Small caps|small-cap]] and value stocks can migrate to a large-cap or a growth stock index when they rise in price, small-cap and value indexes tend to generate realized capital gains. [[Tax-managed fund comparison|Tax-managed funds]] (which are willing to deviate from the index to minimize taxes), [[Exchange-traded funds|ETFs]], and funds with an ETF class can eliminate many of these realized gains. Value indexes are less tax-efficient than growth or blend indexes because they have higher dividend yields; small-cap funds have lower dividend yields but fewer qualified dividends.

[[Real estate investment trust|REITs]], although they trade as stocks, must distribute almost all their income, and the income is taxable at the non-qualified dividend rate except for a small portion (historically about 15%) which is non-taxable because it compensates for depreciation of the property. Under the 2018 tax law changes, some of the income from REITs is treated as qualified business income; only 80% of that income is taxed.

If all else is equal, [[Domestic/International|international funds]] have a small tax advantage over US funds, because they are eligible for the [[Foreign tax credit | foreign tax credit]]. All else is not necessarily equal; if an emerging market is reclassified as developed, an emerging-markets index fund will have to sell all its stock in that country, infrequently generating a large capital gain. A fund including both developed and emerging markets such as [{{Vf | 0770}} Vanguard FTSE All-World ex-US Index Fund] or [{{Vf | 0113}} Vanguard Total International Index Fund] avoids this risk.

== Assigning asset classes to different accounts==
Treat your entire portfolio as a whole (include spouse).

*Consider what you already own. It may be inadvisable to pay additional taxes just to get a more tax efficient location. Even if your current location is not ideal it may be better to stick with certain aspects of it. This could mean keeping tax inefficient investments in a taxable account. Over time you can reduce the effect of a historically imposed asset location by not automatically reinvesting taxable distributions. Take any distributions in cash and reinvest them in a tax efficient manner.

=== Step 1: Categorize your portfolio's tax efficiency ===
Understand the tax consequences of holding each of your chosen investment assets based on the tax-efficiency of each asset class.

=== Step 2: Place your least tax efficient funds first ===
Fill your ''tax-advantaged'' accounts with your least efficient funds. Exhaust these accounts before putting these funds into your taxable account; if you run out of room, consider more tax-efficient alternatives, such as a stock index fund rather than an active fund or a muni bond fund rather than a total-market bond fund. An example portfolio with three asset classes (a total market US stock market index fund; a total market international stock market index fund, and an intermediate taxable bond fund,) is shown below. ''Note that in this scenario, we assume bond interest rates have a higher tax cost than stock investments.''

|+'''An example using three asset classes'''
||[[File:Slide2.JPG|center|650px]]
|}

=== Step 3: Placing international stock funds in the taxable account ===
It is sometimes possible to get tax credit for foreign taxes paid from international stock funds, but you lose this opportunity in tax-advantaged accounts. If all else is equal, the existence of the credit may make it advantageous to prioritize these funds in the taxable account. Whether or not the foreign tax credit is enough depends on factors such as the the percentage of the fund's foreign source income component, the foreign tax rate, the percentage of the foreign dividends that are qualified, and your US marginal tax bracket.

{|style="border-collapse: collapse; border: 1px solid #a2a9b1" &lt;!-- set border="1" to see table boundaries--&gt;
|+'''(Example) Consider foreign tax credit'''
||[[File:Slide3.JPG|center|650px]]
|}

=== Step 4: Place high growth stock funds ===
If all else is equal (and it often is not, because you may have different options in your 401(k) and your Roth IRA), it is slightly better to have the fund with the highest expected return in your Roth account or HSA, because these accounts are free from Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs),&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Roth IRAs are not subject to the RMD when held by the original owner, or after the owner's death, when rolled over into a spousal Roth IRA. Non spousal inheritors of a Roth IRA are subject to RMD rules.&lt;/ref&gt; are not counted as income for making Social Security taxable, and probably are less subject to the risk of changing tax rates.&lt;ref group="note"&gt; For simplicity, many people manage their asset allocation without regard to taxes. When Roth IRA accounts are much smaller than tax-deferred accounts this approximation works well. But it can be noted that moving the asset with the greatest expected future value from tax-deferred to a tax-free account does increase the risk/return of the investor. A simple way to view this [[Tax-adjusted asset allocation|tax-adjusted allocation]] for an investor in the 25% tax bracket is that the government is a 25% owner of the tax-deferred account. When moving an asset increases the investor's ownership of a high risk/return asset from 75% to 100% (in a Roth IRA), the overall portfolio risk-return increases as well.&lt;/ref&gt;

|+'''(Example) High growth stock fund placement'''
||[[File:Slide4.JPG|center|650px]]
|}

=== Step 5: Place tax efficient funds last ===
Tax-efficient funds are fine in any account. It is particularly easy to regularly [[rebalancing|rebalance]] your stock/bond ratio if you have enough room in your tax-advantaged accounts to hold some of your tax-efficient stock fund, because the stocks and bonds can be exchanged without tax consequence. Rebalancing in a taxable account is often best done by investing new money so that you can avoid capital gains.

|}

==Criticisms of this tax placement strategy==
Because they have higher returns, equities can effectively expand your tax-advantaged space, leading to higher tax savings later on despite higher tax bills in the present. This is particularly true at low bond yields, when the tax penalty from bonds in taxable is not as high as it has been in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{forum link| p=1866211| title=Re: Delete Wiki on Tax-Efficient Asset Location}}, direct link to relevant post.&lt;/ref&gt;

The situation may change in retirement, when you withdraw the funds for income (decumulation phase). It is possible, under some combinations of lifetime investment results and lifetime individual tax situations, to be better off doing the opposite of the strategy recommended here.&lt;ref&gt;{{forum link| p=1858213| title=Re: Delete Wiki on Tax-Efficient Asset Location}}, direct link to relevant post.&lt;/ref&gt;

This article may be biased towards investors who can fill tax-advantaged space and are looking to invest more. However, some investors (especially those just starting out) cannot fill all this space. This can make this strategy confusing and possibly counterproductive if, for example, someone is buying international equities in taxable space without filling tax-advantaged space just to get the foreign tax credit.&lt;ref&gt;{{forum link| p=1857006| title=Re: Delete Wiki on Tax-Efficient Asset Location}}, direct link to relevant post.&lt;/ref&gt;

This article says that cash and low-yielding bonds are tax efficient, but then contradicts this somewhat by then classifying "most bonds" as tax inefficient. When interest rates are low, bonds are more tax-efficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{forum link| p=1857264| title=Re: Delete Wiki on Tax-Efficient Asset Location}}, direct link to relevant post. Also, the following post.&lt;/ref&gt; If bonds are tax-efficient now, and then yields rise to make them less tax-efficient, you can go from bonds in taxable to bonds in tax-advantaged with little, no, or negative tax cost; therefore, it is reasonable to hold bonds in a taxable account now and switch later if appropriate. In contrast, switching from stocks to bonds in taxable will result in a significant tax cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{forum link| p=1857293| title=Re: Delete Wiki on Tax-Efficient Asset Location}}, direct link to relevant post.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appendix: comparison of hypothetical tax costs ==
For buy and hold investors, the tax cost of holding a fund depends on how much the fund generates in taxable distributions, and the tax rate on those distributions. For long-term holdings, estimation of tax costs necessarily depends on assumptions about the expected returns and future tax policy, such as that long-term gains will continue to be taxed at a lower rate than short-term gains or bond interest; or that the tax preference for[[Qualified dividend | "qualified dividends"]] will extend into the distant future. The following tax costs math helps identify high tax cost candidates for tax-advantaged accounts.

Table 1 assumptions use historical data from Vanguard's index funds, which is used as a guide for qualified dividends, and the relative yields of value, small-cap, and tax-managed funds. Future capital gains are uncertain, but the table now assumes that all ETFs will avoid capital gains, as most ETFs have done so. Interest for bond funds is based on historical rates, not current rates, because the numbers are easy to measure; a bond which has a 6% yield loses 1.32% to taxes in a 22% tax bracket whether that is the current yield on a short-term bond or a long-term bond. The "tax cost" listed for municipal bonds is the hidden cost, the amount you lose in returns to avoid paying the tax; it is based on an assumption that municipal bonds yield 75% as much as taxable bonds of comparable risk.

Moreover, Table 1 is based on the assumption that foreign dividend yields will remain higher than US yields, as has been true since 2008; foreign yields are assumed to be 1.5 times US stock yields (before foreign taxes are withheld). ''If foreign yields become equal to US yields, then the tax costs of foreign funds must be multiplied by 2/3. Thus, in the table, US and foreign funds are about equally tax-efficient, but if foreign yields become lower, foreign funds will be somewhat more tax-efficient.''

There are two types of tax costs: the cost you pay every year, and the costs you pay when you sell. Bond funds have little or no tax cost when you sell, since almost all the return from bonds is from interest. When you sell a stock fund, you will pay capital-gains tax on the difference between the total amount you invested (including reinvested dividends) and the current value.

Table 2 indicates the additional cost for the capital-gains tax when you sell, assuming that you pay taxes on the distribution and reinvest the after-tax portion of the distribution; because it is a one-time cost, the effect is annualized. For example, if you hold an investment for 30 years and lose 10% to taxes when you sell, that is equivalent to losing 0.35% every year. If you sell the fund, your cost will be the sum of the Table 1 and Table 2 costs. However, you would not pay the Table 2 cost on any stock which you either leave to your heirs or donate to charity, and so may not pay that cost on your full investment. In particular, you might estimate your total tax cost by using the low-return line in Table 2; if stock returns are high, you will have a large taxable account and will reduce the tax cost by taking longer to deplete it or by not spending it all during your lifetime.

The tables use a 15% tax on qualified dividends and capital gains for an investor in the 22% bracket, and 23.8% (including the 3.8% Medicare surtax) on qualified dividends and capital gains, 40.8% on ordinary investment income, for an investor in the top 37% bracket. The final column of the second table (in the top tax bracket) assumes a tax rate of 0.46% for the tax-efficient fund, and 1.50% for the tax-inefficient fund. The [[Foreign tax credit | foreign tax credit]] is added to the dividend yield before computing taxes; for example, if a fund had $100 withheld in foreign taxes on dividends, and you pay $20 in taxes on the withheld dividends, you get a $100 credit for a net benefit of $80. Although not tabulated, keep in mind that investors in the lower tax brackets (12% or lower) pay no tax at all on qualified dividends and capital gains, and reap higher after-tax returns, outside of tax-exempt municipal bonds, in all asset classes.

===Example===
An investor in the 22% marginal tax bracket wants to compare the tax efficiency of a total-market index fund and a bond fund yielding 3% (0.66% tax cost). Because these funds are likely to be sold at some point, they can use Table 2 to project an estimate of the range (depending upon whether future returns are low or high) of the total annualized cost. The estimate shows that holding the bond fund in a tax-deferred account is likely to be slightly better over a long holding period; if the stock market returns are high, most of the stock will not be sold.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is the tax rate on a ''change'' in income (i.e. change in tax/change in income). To emphasize the "change" calculation, the marginal rate is often described as the tax rate on the "next dollar" or "last dollar" of income.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

However, due to the way the tax code is written (particularly the requirement to use the tax tables, but for other aspects as well), actual tax rates on a single dollar change can be misleading. For useful numbers, the marginal tax rate is often either calculated on a larger change in income, or by using an approximate form of the tax code.

The marginal tax rate is often the same as the individual's ''tax bracket'', but not always.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Since the income tax structure includes various types of income, deductions, exclusions, credits, and taxes that are not subject to the same treatment under tax laws, the marginal tax rate is not always apparent.  See: [http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-soi/13inwinbulratesshare.pdf Individual Income Tax Rates and Shares, 2010], Statistics of Income Bulletin, Winter 2013, page 23 (printed), from the IRS.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;A "tax-bracket" is not formally defined, but inspection of US law shows the intended usage. Note that the term "rate bracket" is also used. From [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/1?qt-us_code_tabs=0#qt-us_code_tabs 26 U.S. Code § 1 - Tax imposed]:

*(f) Phaseout of marriage penalty in ''15-percent bracket'';
*...maximum dollar amounts for each ''rate bracket''...
*(7) Special rule for certain ''brackets''
&lt;/ref&gt;

A marginal tax rate is '''''not''''' the average (a.k.a. "effective") tax rate paid on your entire income.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kitces.com/blog/understanding-marginal-tax-rate-vs-effective-tax-rate-and-when-to-use-each/| title=Understanding Marginal Tax Rate Vs Effective Tax Rate And When To Use Each|last=Kitces|first=Michael|date=January 30, 2013|website=kitces.com|access-date=April 28, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marginal tax rates are useful in many contexts for making decisions, because they describe the effect of a particular change. While the average tax rate is interesting to know, it doesn't help in [[Marginal tax rate#Using the marginal rate|making decisions]] the same way the '''marginal tax rate''' can. 

==Calculation==

Assuming that your marginal tax rate is equal to your tax bracket, calculated using your taxable income (Adjusted Gross Income minus deductions), is often correct. However, due to the complexity of the tax code, the actual marginal rate can be much different. Income can also phase out benefits and phase in additional taxes. For a single filer with $10K long term capital gains (LTCG), if nominally in the 12% bracket but an additional dollar of ordinary income pushes a dollar of LTCG from its 0% bracket to its 15% bracket, the marginal rate on that ordinary income is 27% as shown below.  The 27% is the sum of 12% on the ordinary income dollar, plus the 15% on the LTCG dollar.

For visual learners, charts such as the one above may be generated for individual households using the [https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Tools_and_calculators#Personal_finance_toolbox personal finance toolbox] Excel spreadsheet.&lt;ref name ="MrMoney"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;, which handles most common tax situations.

====Example====

A single taxpayer earns $80,000 gross income. After taking the federal standard deduction of $16,100 and deducting another $10,000 contribution to a [[401(k)]], their taxable income is $53,900, putting them in the 22% federal tax bracket. Assuming no phase-outs, their marginal tax rate is 22%, meaning each additional dollar earned results in an additional 22 cents of federal income tax. The total federal income tax due for this individual is $6,762 ($1,183 in the 10% bracket, $4,386 in the 12% bracket, and $1,193 on the last $5,425 in the 22% bracket; see: [[Progressive tax#Tax bracket|Tax bracket]]), for an "average" tax rate of only 8.45% relative to gross income or 12.54% relative to taxable income.

===State taxes===
{{Main|State income taxes}}

Your state income tax rate adds to your federal income tax rate. For example, if your federal tax bracket is 24%, your state tax bracket is 8%, you aren't affected by credits, phase-outs, etc., and can't deduct the additional state tax, an extra $1 of income would cause you to pay 8 cents in state tax and 24 cents in federal tax, so your marginal rate is 32%.  If you can deduct the additional state tax, the 8 cents in state taxes mean that you pay federal tax on only 92 additional cents, which is 22.08 cents of federal tax (22.08% = 92 cents * 24%) and a marginal rate of 30.08% = (22.08% + 8%).  To get this marginal tax benefit, you need to itemize deductions, and your state and local taxes need to be below the SALT limit which phases out at high income.

===Social Security benefits===
{{Main|Taxation of Social Security benefits}}

Taxation of Social Security benefits causes many moderate-income retirees to be subject to a much higher marginal tax rate than their tax bracket.  If you are in the range in which [[Social Security]] becomes taxable, each additional $1 of income causes an extra 50 or 85 cents of Social Security to be taxable at the same tax rate, until 85% of the whole benefit is taxable.  If you are in the 12% bracket and each $1 causes an extra 85 cents to be taxable, that extra $1 of income increases your taxable income by $1.85, with 22.2 cents due in tax giving you a marginal tax rate of 22.2%.  If you are in the 22% bracket and each $1 causes 85 cents to be taxable, your marginal tax rate is 40.7%. This phase-in of taxation can cause a "hump" in marginal rate over an income range, above which the marginal rate drops back down once the maximum 85% of Social Security benefits are taxable. Retirees near this range may choose to alter their tax strategy, to try to either fall just before the range, or far above it. 

===Section 199A deductions===

The 2018 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act allows certain types of businesses to deduct 20% of certain types of income, called Qualified Business Income (QBI). Every $1 of QBI causes only 80 cents of additional taxable income. So, if you are in the 24% tax bracket, it results in 19.2 cents of additional tax, and your marginal federal tax rate is 19.2%. For a "Specified Service Trade or Business" subject to the phase-outs of the Section 199A deduction ($201,750-$403,500 single and $403,500-$553,500 married filing jointly, as of 2026), the marginal tax rate gets more complicated and varies over the phase-out range; see an analysis [[Tax_analysis#Variable_Marginal_Rates_with_Section_199A_Deduction|here]]. Maximum federal marginal tax rates in the phase-out range can be 66.6% or higher.

===Child Tax Credit phase-out===

The 2018 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act offers a tax credit of $2,000 per qualifying child, with phase-out of $50 credit reduction for every $1,000 above the limits of $200,000 Modified Adjusted Gross Income for single filers and $400,000 MAGI for married filers. Each additional dollar of income over these limits reduces the credit by 5 cents ($50/$1,000), raising the marginal tax rate by 5% until the credit is phased out completely, over a range of $40,000 per child.

===Student loan interest deduction phase-out===

Qualifying student loan interest is capped at $2,500 per return for either single or married joint filers (married separate filers can't deduct student loan interest). The phase-out for this deduction is between $85,000-$100,000 Adjusted Gross Income for single filers and $170,000-$200,000 for married joint filers. Both of these phase-outs are usually in the 22% bracket. For single filers, each additional dollar of income causes ~16.67 cents ($2,500/$15,000) of interest to become non-deductible, generating ~3.67 cents (~16.67 * 22%) of addition tax, so the marginal tax rate is increased by ~3.67%. For married joint filers, each additional dollar of income causes ~8.33 cents ($2,500/$30,000) of interest to become non-deductible, generating ~1.83 cents (~8.33 * 22%) of addition tax, so the marginal rate is increased by ~1.83%. If the taxpayer paid less than $2,500 in qualifying student loan interest, the marginal rate increase would be proportionally less.

===Long-term capital gains and qualified dividends===
{{Main|Qualified dividend}}

Long-term capital gains and qualified dividends are taxed at a reduced rate by the IRS: either 0%, 15%, or 20% depending on income. Additionally, the IRS assesses the [[ACA net investment income tax|Net Investment Income Tax (NIIT)]] on the lesser of investment income and MAGI over $200,000 for single filers or $250,000 for married joint filers. For high earners this can result in a federal marginal rate on long-term capital gains and qualified dividends of up to 23.8%.

===Payroll taxes===
{{Main|Payroll tax}}

The IRS assesses Payroll Taxes (also called FICA Taxes) on [[Earned income|earned income]] (wages). The tax has three components:

* Social Security tax on individual wages up to the Social Security Wage Base ($184.500 in 2025): 6.2% paid by the employee and 6.2% paid by the employer
* Medicare tax on all individual wages: 1.45% paid by the employee and 1.45% paid by the employer
* Additional Medicare Tax on wages over $200,000 for single taxpayers and $250,000 for married couples filing jointly: 0.9% paid by the employee

Payroll taxes increase your marginal tax rate on earned income above the level of just income tax. Most sources do not include payroll taxes when discussing marginal tax rates. The reason is that the most common use of marginal tax rates is making investment decisions, either calculating after-tax rates of return or deciding between Traditional and Roth contributions. For both of these purposes, payroll taxes do not come into play, because payroll taxes are not assessed against investment income, and Traditional contributions are not payroll tax-deductible. However, for other purposes (see below, [[#Using the marginal rate|using the marginal rate]]), payroll taxes would need to be included.

====Self-employed payroll taxes====

Self-employed taxpayers (either sole proprietors or incorporated) are required to pay both halves of payroll taxes. Sole proprietors pay payroll tax on [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1040sse.pdf IRS Schedule SE (Form 1040)]. Schedule SE scales down self-employed business income by a factor of 92.35%, so that the employer half of payroll tax is tax-deductible, the same as it would be for a corporation. Therefore, the marginal tax rate on self-employment income is not exactly the same as the payroll tax rates. 

For income less than the Social Security Wage Base (SSWB), each additional dollar of business income results in ~14.13 cents (92.35% * 15.3%) of payroll tax, of which half (~7.06 cents) is deductible against income tax. If the taxpayer has a marginal income tax rate of 22%, the total marginal tax rate on business income would be '''~34.57%''' ((1 - 7.06%)*22% + 14.13%), significantly less than the 37.3% (22% + 15.3%) which would result if employer payroll taxes were not deductible. 

For income above the the SSWB, each additional dollar of business income results in ~2.68 cents (92.35% * 2.9%) of payroll tax, of which half (~1.34 cents) is deductible against income tax. If the taxpayer has a marginal income tax rate of 22%, the total marginal tax rate on business income would be '''~24.38%''' ((1 - 1.34%)*22% + 2.68%).

If the additional business income were also deductible under [[#Section 199A deductions|Section 199A]], then the marginal tax rates would be '''~30.18%''' ((1 - 7.06% - 20%)*22% + 14.13%) and '''~19.98%''' ((1 - 1.34% - 20%)*22% + 2.68%) respectively.

==Special cases==
===Marginal rate less than zero===

A negative marginal tax rate means that the government, in effect, ''subsidizes'' additional income, rather than taxes it. For example, with a marginal tax rate of -10%, an additional $100 of income results in a ''decrease'' of tax liability by $10. Negative marginal federal income tax rates commonly occur in the United States due to the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_income_tax_credit Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC)]. The EITC is a [[Federal tax credits for individuals#Refundable tax credits|refundable]] credit, meaning it can lower an individual's total tax liability below zero, so they can receive an overall refund for the tax year.  If you include FICA taxes, the marginal (federal income plus FICA) tax rates do not go negative.

===Marginal rate of zero===

A tax with a marginal rate of zero is a fixed-amount tax, such as a tax of $100 on every house rather than a percentage of the value of the house.

===Flat rate tax===

A flat rate tax has a constant marginal tax rate. Sales taxes and property taxes are normally flat, a fixed percentage of the value.  Income taxes in some states are almost flat; typically, there is a fixed amount (such as a standard deduction) which is exempt from tax, and everyone making more than that fixed amount pays the same marginal tax rate, so the average tax rate varies.

===Marginal rate greater than 100%===

A marginal tax rate of greater than 100% means that a taxpayer's total tax liability increases faster than their income, meaning they take home less money the more they earn. Generally, tax codes are written to try to avoid situations where marginal tax rates are greater than 100%, due to the obvious disincentive for work and economic productivity it would create. Nonetheless, tax analysts sometimes find cases under current or proposed tax laws where a combination of additional tax, loss of subsides, and other factors combine to create effective marginal tax rates greater than 100%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Abrupt changes in tax liability with income can produce "spikes" in marginal tax rates far greater than 100%, see [[#Spikes in marginal tax rates|below]].

===Spikes in marginal tax rate===

When a tax kicks in or a benefit is lost abruptly, as opposed to being phased in or out gradually, the calculated marginal tax rate on the income that causes the change can be very large. For example, in a case analyzed in the [[User:Fyre4ce/Traditional versus Roth#Real-world example|Traditional versus Roth]] article, an additional $200 [[Saver's credit]] is earned for a $12,500 retirement savings contribution. The last dollar that gains the additional credit has a calculated marginal savings rate of '''20,000%''' ($200/$1), and if calculated using the last cent the marginal savings rate is '''2,000,000%''' ($200/$0.01). These numbers are correct, but are not as useful for making decisions because they only apply to a tiny amount of savings or income. In this case, it would be more useful to calculate the rate over the entire contribution necessary to gain the credit; that rate is '''1.6%''' ($200/$12,500) in addition to other components of the overall rate. This figure is a better reflection of the value in making that contribution. For those very close to a spike in a marginal rate, even the rate over the entire change may be high; if only $500 savings were necessary to earn a $200 credit, the savings rate would be the rate on the $500 plus 40% ($200/$500). 

On the income side, [[Traditional versus Roth examples#Worth pushing through the Social Security hump and/or IRMAA cliffs?|Worth pushing through the Social Security hump and/or IRMAA cliffs?]] discusses similar situations. 

==Multiple rates and combined rates==
Note that you may have a different marginal tax rate on different types of income and savings. Consider the State Tax example above, with a marginal rate on ordinary income of 32%. The marginal tax rate on [[Bond basics#Taxes|Treasury bonds]] (which are fully taxed by federal, not taxed by the state) is only 24%. The marginal tax rate on capital gains is 15% federal but probably fully taxed by the state at 8%. If additional state tax is deductible, then the marginal rate on capital gains will be 21.08% (15% + 8% - (24% x 8%) for deduction of the state tax), otherwise 23%. For either single or married joint filers, Section 199A Qualified Business Income (QBI) will have a different marginal rate than non-QBI, and if the Section 199A deduction is being phased out, the rates will be variable. An investor with a small business and a reasonably simple portfolio could have at least ''eight'' separate marginal rates for different types of income and savings:

* [[Earned income]], subject to income tax, phase-outs, and [[Payroll tax|payroll tax]] (including the Additional Medicare Tax)
* Investment income, subject to income tax, phase-outs, and [[ACA net investment income tax|Net Investment Income Tax (NIIT)]]
* Long-term capital gains and qualified dividends, subject to reduced income tax rates, phase-outs, and NIIT
* Section 199A Qualified Business Income (QBI), subject to income tax and phase-outs but offering the QBI deduction
* Social Security income, taxed as income at a rate determined by the Social Security Benefits Worksheet in [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i1040gi.pdf IRS Form 1040 Instructions]
* Treasury bond income, subject to federal income tax and phase-outs, but exempt from state income tax
* Municipal bond income, tax-free, except for the phase-in of Social Security benefits
* Marginal savings rate for tax-deferred contributions may be different from the marginal tax rate on income due to the [[Saver's credit|Saver's Credit]]

[[Social_Security_tax_impact_calculator|Combining this effect with Social Security benefits]] can produce even higher rates.  Consider a taxpayer in the 85% phase-in of Social Security taxations, with ordinary income in the 12% tax bracket but some qualified dividends taxed at 0% and some at 15%.  An additional $1 of ordinary income makes 85 cents of SS taxable.  The $1.85 is itself taxed at 12%, but it also causes $1.85 of qualified dividends to be taxed at 15% rather than 0%, so the marginal tax rate is 27% on the $1.85.  The taxpayer's overall tax rate is thus:
* traditional IRA distributions is 49.95%
* qualified dividends is 37.95%
* social security income is 11.475%
Not all high marginal rates are unfavorable.  E.g., due to the saver's and earned income credits, marginal savings rates can be much higher than the tax bracket would suggest.

==Using the marginal rate==

Understanding how marginal rates affect the consequences of your financial choices can help you make better choices.  Some examples are given below.

===Marginal return of additional income===

The marginal tax rate tells the taxpayer how much of each additional dollar they earn they get to keep. For this reason, those who can control how much income they earn might choose to work just up to the point that their marginal tax rate jumps up.

===After-tax value of investments===

The marginal tax rate determines the relative after-tax value of different investments. The after-tax rates of return using the formula:

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\text{[after-tax return]} &amp; = \text{[before-tax return]} \cdot \left ( 1-\text{[marginal tax rate]} \right )
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Consider the individual from the State Taxes section above, considering three bond investments: a [[Corporate bonds|corporate bond]], a [[Treasury bond]], and a [[Municipal bonds|municipal bond]] from the individual's state. The corporate bond is fully taxable at both federal and state levels, and state income tax is federally deductible. The Treasury bond is taxable at the federal level, but not state. The municipal bond is tax-free at both federal and state levels. Assume each bond is purchased at par value. The after-tax returns of each investment are as follows:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Investment !! Yield !! Marginal Tax Rate !! After-Tax Return
|-
| Corporate Bond || 4.00% || 30.08% || 2.797%
|-
| Treasury Bond || 3.50% || 24% || 2.660%
|-
| Municipal Bond || 3.00% || 0% || 3.000%
|}

Assuming no other factors (such as risk) are being considered, the municipal bond has the highest after-tax return and would therefore be the best investment.

===Traditional vs. Roth===
{{Main|Traditional versus Roth}}

Deciding between Traditional and Roth contributions is another use for marginal rates. In general, Traditional contributions are better as long as your ''predicted'' marginal tax rate in the future is lower than your marginal tax rate now. Roth contributions are better when your ''predicted'' marginal tax rate in the future is higher than your marginal tax rate now. Predicting future tax rates can be difficult; it depends on future tax laws, long-term investment performance, and your ability to continue to make contributions over many years. See that article for more details and strategy.

You should also recognize that, over the range of allowable retirement contributions, the marginal tax rate may vary considerably, at breakpoints in the tax bracket structure and when phase-outs come into play. In those cases, splitting contributions between Traditional and Roth may be the best strategy.

==Appendix: Marginal rates explained==
{{Notice| This section explains why the differential calculus concept of a derivative for tax rate is often not useful in personal finance, but calculating the marginal rate with a difference equation is useful. It is intended for those familiar with calculus and is not necessary for understanding the concepts presented in the previous sections.}}

The tax code, particularly when taxable income is under $100,000 and Tax Tables are used, produces a very non-smooth function of tax vs. income. With the Tax Tables, for most changes in income the tax does not change at all, but every $50 there is a step change. 

===Comparison of difference vs. derivative===
Your income increases from $20,000 to $20,100; which provides you with $100 of extra income. This additional $100 of income results in $15 of additional tax. The marginal rate is therefore 15% = $15 / $100. 

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
{marginal\ tax\ rate\ at\ income\ of\ $20,000} = \frac{tax(20,000 + 100) - tax(20,000)}{(20,000 + 100) - (20,000)} \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
{marginal\ tax\ rate(I)} = \frac{tax(I + \Delta) - tax(I)}{\Delta}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The last equation above is the general form for calculating the tax rate for the given change of income.
The step below will be familiar to those who remember differential calculus, but is not recommended for use with tax calculations when the tax function is non-smooth, due to the lack of useful information it provides.

&lt;math&gt;\frac{df(x)}{dx} = \lim_{\delta\rightarrow 0} \frac{(f(x+\delta)-f(x))}{\delta}&lt;/math&gt;

===As a partial derivative===
A ''partial'' derivative indicates that the tax is not a function of one income, e.g. total income, but several different types of income. For example, wages and capital gains. So we have not a function of one variable '''tax(income)''' but a function of two variables '''tax(wages,gains)'''.

A partial derivative of a function of two or more variables is just the derivative if we change one variable and leave the others constant. This is how marginal tax rates are usually calculated.  Refer to the previous example. At an income of $20,000, the marginal tax rate on wages is 15% because an extra $100 of wages increase taxes by $15. However, the marginal tax rate on capital gains is 0% because an extra $100 of capital gains results in $0 extra tax.

The same concept applies to the difference form of the calculation: one independent variable changes while the others are held constant.

The '''foreign tax credit''' is intended to reduce the double tax burden that would otherwise arise when foreign income is taxed by both the United States and the foreign country from which the income is derived.  The credit is the amount you paid to the foreign country, but it is usually limited up to the fraction of your U.S. income tax corresponding to taxable income attributed to the foreign country; for example, if 5% of your taxable income was subject to foreign tax, you cannot take a credit for more than 5% of your U.S. tax.  Details are in IRS [http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1116.pdf Form 1116] and [http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i1116.pdf Form 1116 Instructions].

==Qualifying for the foreign tax credit==
Generally, income taxes paid or accrued to a foreign country or a U.S. possession, or taxes paid or accrued to a foreign country or U.S. possession in lieu of an income tax, will qualify for the foreign tax credit.

The IRS defines four tests that must be met for any foreign tax to qualify for the credit:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=September 26, 2022|title=Foreign Taxes that Qualify for the Foreign Tax Credit|url=https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/foreign-taxes-that-qualify-for-the-foreign-tax-credit|access-date=October 1, 2022|website=Internal Revenue Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;There are are some foreign taxes for which you cannot take a foreign tax credit. See: [https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/foreign-taxes-that-qualify-for-the-foreign-tax-credit Foreign Taxes that Qualify for the Foreign Tax Credit], Internal Revenue Service.&lt;/ref&gt;

#The tax must be imposed on you. You can claim a credit only for foreign taxes that are imposed on you by a foreign country or U.S. possession. For example, a tax that is deducted from your wages is considered to be imposed on you.
#You must have paid or accrued the tax. You can claim a credit only if you paid or accrued the foreign tax to a foreign country or U.S. possession.
#The tax must be the legal and actual foreign tax liability. Your qualified foreign tax is only the legal and actual foreign tax liability that you paid or accrued during the year.
#The tax must be an income tax (or a tax in lieu of an income tax).
Tax-deferred accounts, such as a [[Traditional IRA]] or [[401(k)]], don't qualify for the foreign tax credit because the income in those accounts is not subject to US income tax. Withdrawals from a [[Roth IRA]] also don't qualify for the foreign tax credit because withdrawals are not taxed by the IRS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=April 2021|title=Claiming Foreign Taxes: Credit or Deduction?|url=https://workplace.schwab.com/resource-center/insights/content/claiming-foreign-taxes-credit-or-deduction|access-date=October 1, 2022|website=Charles Schwab}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tax forms==
For [[mutual fund]] shareholders, you may be able to claim the credit based on your share of foreign income taxes paid by the fund if it chooses to pass the credit on to its shareholders. You should receive from the mutual fund a Form 1099-DIV, or similar statement, showing the foreign country or U.S. possession, your share of the foreign income, and your share of the foreign taxes paid. Form 1099-DIV Box 6 reports foreign tax paid, and this amount is included in Box 1a, even though it represents dividends you don't actually receive.

You can choose to take the amount of any qualified foreign taxes paid or accrued during the year as a foreign tax credit or as an itemized deduction. To choose the deduction, you must itemize deductions on [http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1040sa.pdf Form 1040, Schedule A]. To choose the foreign tax credit you generally must complete [http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1116.pdf Form 1116] and attach it to your Form 1040.

:'''Exception:''' you do not have to complete [http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1116.pdf Form 1116] to take the credit if all five of the following apply:
#All of your gross foreign source income was from interest and dividends and all of that income and the foreign tax paid on it were reported to you on Form 1099-INT, Form 1099-DIV, or Schedule K-1.
#If you had dividend income from shares of stock, you held those shares for at least 16 days.
#You are not filing [http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f4563.pdf Form 4563] (Exclusion of income for bona fide residents of American Samoa) or excluding income from sources within Puerto Rico.
#The total of your foreign taxes was not more than $300, or $600 if married filing jointly.
# All of your foreign taxes were:
#*Legally owed and not eligible for a refund, and
#* Paid to countries that are recognized by the United States and do not support terrorism.

==Example of how it affects your taxes==

Say that you hold an international stock fund.  The stocks in the fund earn $1000 in dividends, but foreign countries withhold tax of $70 on those dividends.  Therefore, the fund only pays you $930 in dividends; this is what you will receive if you hold the fund in a tax-advantaged account.

Now say that you hold the fund in a taxable account, you are in a 22% tax bracket, and 70% of the dividends are [[qualified dividend|qualified]]. Your Form 1099-DIV reports $1000 in dividends, $70 in foreign tax withheld, and $700 in qualified dividends. 

When you do your taxes, you would owe tax on the full $1000 in dividends; 15% of the $700 qualified dividend and 22% of the $300 non-qualified dividend is $171. Without the foreign tax credit, this would result in a total tax impact of $241, including $171 for U.S. taxes and $70 in foreign withholding.

Next, you take the foreign tax credit, which reduces your tax liability by $70 (assuming no limitations apply), so your total U.S. tax liability would only be $101. The foreign tax credit applied here results in a total tax impact of $171, including only $101 for U.S. taxes and $70 in foreign withholding.

You have $829 after tax, just as if you had received the full $1000 and there had been no foreign tax withholding.

==Choosing to take the credit or a deduction==

You can choose each tax year to take the amount of any qualified foreign taxes paid or accrued during the year as a foreign tax credit or as an itemized deduction. You can change your choice for each year's taxes.

To choose the foreign tax credit, you generally must complete [http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1116.pdf Form 1116], as mentioned above. To choose to claim the taxes as an itemized deduction, use [http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1040sa.pdf Form 1040, Schedule A (Itemized Deductions)].

Although no one rule covers all situations, it is generally better to take a credit for qualified foreign taxes than to deduct them as an itemized deduction on [http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1040sa.pdf Form 1040, Schedule A]. This is because:

# A credit reduces your actual U.S. income tax on a dollar-for-dollar basis, while a deduction reduces only your income subject to tax
#You can choose to take the foreign tax credit even if you do not itemize your deductions. You then are allowed the standard deduction in addition to the credit, and
# If you choose to take the foreign tax credit, and the taxes paid or accrued exceed the credit limit for the tax year, you may be able to carry over or carry back the excess to another tax year.

==How to find information for Vanguard funds==
In order to fill out Form 1116, you need to list your total foreign source income.  If you hold a Vanguard mutual fund, or hold Vanguard [[exchange-traded fund]]s (ETFs) in a Vanguard brokerage account, you will receive a Foreign Tax Paid Reporting Information statement which lists the total.  If you hold a non-Vanguard fund or ETF in a Vanguard brokerage account, or hold funds or ETFs in a non-Vanguard brokerage account, the brokerage may not list the foreign source income, so you will need to find the correct amount from the ETF provider.

For Vanguard, select Investor Resources and Education-&gt;Tax Center, then click on "Tax Information for Vanguard Funds."  This has links to several tax documents, including "Vanguard funds that are eligible for the foreign tax credit."  For 2023, the document is [https://investor.vanguard.com/content/dam/retail/publicsite/en/documents/taxes/piftcws-2024.pdf Vanguard funds that are eligible for the foreign tax credit] (2023 data despite the 2024 in the file name).

This document lists the foreign income percentage, which you multiply by the total income from the fund to find the foreign amount.  It also lists the foreign qualified dividend percentage, which you may need if the Form 1116 instructions require you to adjust your foreign qualified dividends; this applies if you are in a 32% or higher tax bracket, or if you have over $20K in foreign qualified dividends and long-term gains.

==State income taxes==
Some states allow a credit for foreign income taxes, computed the same way as the credit for taxes paid to other states; combined with the federal credit, this gives a double benefit.  Since the state tax rate is usually lower than the foreign tax rate, you will not get a full state credit for the foreign tax, but the foreign income will be effectively tax-free.  In these states, it is particularly attractive to hold foreign stocks in a taxable account

According to [http://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/misc/lfb/informational_papers/january_2019/0004_individual_income_tax_provisions_in_the_states_informational_paper_4.pdf Individual Income Tax Provisions in the states], the foreign tax credit is available in AL, AZ, HI, IA, MT, NC, and a limited credit in LA.

The IRS defines '''{{PAGENAME}}''' (IRD) as follows:&lt;ref name="pub559"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.irs.gov/publications/p559 |title=Publication 559, Survivors, Executors, and Administrators |publisher=IRS |accessdate=May 14, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{blockquote|All income the decedent would have received had death not occurred that wasn't properly includible on the final return ... is income in respect of a decedent. Income in respect of a decedent must be included in the income of one of the following:

*The decedent's estate, if the estate receives it;
*The beneficiary, if the right to income is passed directly to the beneficiary and the beneficiary receives it; or
*Any person to whom the estate properly distributes the right to receive it.
}}

Some common types of IRD include:
*Wages and vacation time paid after death:
*Partnership and Subchapter S Corp income paid after death;
*Installment agreements;
*Interest and dividends earned, but not received, before death;
*Qualified Retirement Plans ([[401(k)]], [[403(b)]], [[457(b)]], [[SIMPLE IRA]], [[SEP]], [[Keogh plan]], and so on);
*[[Traditional IRA|Traditional IRAs]];
*Non-qualified distributions from a [[Roth IRA]];
*The taxable portions of [[:Category:Annuities|annuities]];
*[[I Savings Bonds|US Savings Bonds]];
*[[Net unrealized appreciation]].

The character of the income you receive in respect of a decedent is the same as it would be to the decedent if they were alive. As a result, retirement plan distributions are taxed to the beneficiary as taxable income, with net unrealized appreciation as a capital gain.

IRD does not receive stepped up valuation when the person dies. If a decedent's estate pays estate tax, the portion of the tax attributable to the estate's IRD is deductible as a miscellaneous itemized deduction (not subject to the 2% AGI exclusion) to the beneficiary receiving the IRD. The deduction is figured by computing the estate tax due on the entire estate and computing the estate tax due on the estate minus all IRD. The difference between the two provides the deductible amount. The deduction is realized on the IRD as the IRD is paid out to the beneficiary.

If you are planning to make a transaction in your taxable account, it may sometimes be worth delaying the transaction slightly in order to reduce taxes.  (Do not wait a long time for the tax-optimal date; any tax saving may be lost in the cost of having the wrong portfolio for too long.)  This page summarizes some of the most common issues.

==Buy after distributions==
If a stock fund is about to make a significant distribution, you may owe tax on that distribution if you hold the fund on the distribution day.  (This does not apply to most bond funds, which pay a dividend for every day you held the fund.)  Therefore, it is often worth waiting until the ex-dividend date, which is the day after it is determined who receives the dividend.

For example, suppose that you would like to invest $21,000 in a fund which is selling at $21 a share and will distribute $1 a share in dividends and capital gains next week.  If you buy now, you will have 1,000 shares, and you will receive a $1,000 distribution.  If the market does not move, the fund price will drop to $20, so you can reinvest the distribution at that price to keep a $21,000 investment; you will then have 1,050 shares with a basis of $22,000, and taxes due on the $1,000 gain.  If you wait until after the distribution, you will not pay any tax, so you will have 1,050 shares with a basis of $21,000; you will not pay tax on the $1,000 basis difference until you sell. 

Another factor to keep in mind is the tax rate that you will pay upon a purchased distribution and the tax rate that will be paid by deferring it and paying the tax at a later date. This factor applies to both [[Qualified dividend‎ | qualified dividends]]  and long term [[Capital gains distribution |capital gains distributions]], both of which are currently taxed at 0% for investors in tax brackets below 22% (the threshold does not quite match but is very close), 15% for most investors, and 20% in the top bracket.  You must also factor in the rate at which the distributions are taxed by [http://www.bankrate.com/finance/taxes/check-taxes-in-your-state.aspx your state of residence] before determining the tax costs of timing the purchase.

If you are planning to invest in a stock index fund which pays dividends quarterly, the distribution should be small enough (likely about 0.5%, all [[Qualified dividend | qualified dividends]]) not to be a concern.

==Sell for long-term gain before distributions==
If you plan to sell a fund which is about to make a distribution, that distribution will reduce your capital gain, but you will pay tax on the distribution.  Therefore, you want to sell before the distribution if the distribution is taxed at a higher rate than the capital gain, and after the distribution if it is taxed at a lower rate.  

For example, suppose that you bought a fund for $18,000 and it is now worth $21,000, and it will distribute $1,000 in gains next week.  If you sell now, you have a $3,000 capital gain; if you wait to receive the distribution before selling, and the market does not move, you will have a $1,000 taxable distribution and a $2,000 capital gain.  Thus, by waiting to sell, you pay tax on $1,000 at the rate on the distribution, rather than at the capital-gains tax rate.  If your gain is long-term, the capital-gains tax rate is less than the distribution tax rate (or at worst equal if the distribution is 100% long-term gains and qualified dividends), so you should sell before the distribution; if your gain is short-term, you should sell after the distribution.

Conversely, it is better to sell an international fund after a distribution of qualified dividends, because the effective tax rate is very low.  You pay taxes on the dividend, but if foreign tax was withheld from the dividends, you get the [[foreign tax credit]].  For example, if the fund earned $1000 in dividends and $100 was withheld in foreign tax, the distribution is $900.  You pay $150 tax on the full $1000, but you will usually be able to take the $100 as a credit, so your net tax is only $50.  (Caution: If your income is very high or you have a lot of foreign income, the foreign tax credit on qualified dividends may be based on a reduced fraction of the income, to adjust for the lower tax rate.  This could limit your credit; see [http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i1116.pdf the IRS Form 1116 instructions] for details.)  

If you are moving between two funds which pay dividends at the same time, you want to move after the dividend payment; you will pay tax on the dividend either way, but you have a lower capital gain if you sell after the distributions.

==Wait for deadlines==
There are several tax rules which depend on the holding period, so you may need to postpone a transaction in order to get the benefit of the deadline.

===Wash sales===
You have a [[wash sale]] and cannot immediately deduct your loss if you sold a fund at a loss and buy back a substantially identical fund within 30 days before or after.  If you would otherwise have a wash sale, wait 31 days to buy the same fund (even if the purchase is in an IRA or 401(k)).  If you purchased a fund less than 31 days ago, either wait until the 31 days are up before selling any shares of that fund at a loss, or, using [[Specific identification of shares]], sell the shares purchased within the last 31 days as well as any other shares you want to sell.  

===Waiting for long-term gains===
If you have substantial gains in a fund, you will have a considerable tax savings if you wait until you have held the fund for a year and a day, so that the gains are taxed at the lower long-term rate.

If you have both long-term and short-term gains this year, then short-term losses will offset the short-term gains, while long-term losses will offset the long-term gains.  Therefore, if you have both types of gains, you should try to sell at a loss before the loss becomes long-term.

===Holding period for qualified dividends===
You are only eligible for the lower tax rate on [[qualified dividend]]s if you hold the shares which paid the dividend for at least 61 days.  If you buy a fund which pays a substantial qualified dividend, wait for the 61 days to be up before selling.  This may be relevant if you are buying the fund as a temporary replacement when [[tax loss harvesting]]

===Special rule for losses on tax-exempt funds===
If you have a loss on an individual municipal bond, or [[ETF]] shares which paid tax-exempt interest, you cannot deduct a loss up to the amount of interest earned on bonds or shares held six months or less.  (This does not apply to bond [[mutual fund]]s which accrue dividends daily and pay them monthly, most bond funds work this way.)  Therefore, wait at least six months before selling such shares if the loss is significant (and, in the meantime, do not reinvest distributions in the fund).  See the references in [[#Links|Links]] for more details.

There is a similar six-month rule for claiming short-term losses on shares which paid out long-term capital-gain distributions, but this is not usually a serious consequence because it merely converts short-term losses to long-term losses rather than eliminating them altogether.

Delaying reinvestment of dividends incurs a small amount of opportunity cost, which is one of the drawbacks of [[Reinvesting dividends in a taxable account | taking dividends in cash]] to simplify tax lot accounting or meet some other goals.  This page calculates a possible effect of delaying reinvestment of dividends.

==Yearly opportunity cost==

If we assume an investment with 8% total return and 2% dividend yield, then delaying reinvestments of each dividend distribution by a month (to possibly combine with new money) costs:

  2% &amp;times; (8% &amp;divide; 12) = 1.33 basis points/year

Note that if you have a paycheck monthly, invest a part of one as soon as you receive it, and combine dividends with the new money, the maximum delay for the dividend reinvestment is one month.

==Effect on the accumulation phase==

How does this opportunity cost compound in 40 years with the following assumptions?

* You invest $10,000 for 40 years.
* You do not pay tax on dividends (for simplicity).
* You get 8% total return.
* You delay reinvesting dividend distributions by one month.
* You do not [[Tax loss harvesting | tax loss harvest]].

The difference comes out to be 0.36% of the fund balance in the taxable account. The difference may be smaller in the following situations:

* You contribute more just before retirement (possibly because you are earning your peak salary, or you have finished funding children's college education).
* You arrange the fund company to send dividends to a money market fund or an interest bearing bank account.

Tax-deferred accounts, such as a [[traditional IRA]], do not incur capital gains taxes, distributions are taxed at income tax rates.}}

This page summarizes the issue of '''wash sales''' for mutual fund and ETF investors, but [https://www.irs.gov/publications/p550/ IRS Publication 550] remains the definitive reference. [https://fairmark.com/investment-taxation/capital-gain/wash/ Fairmark guide to wash sales] is also an excellent source of information. Wash sales are particularly relevant for investors who are [[ tax loss harvesting]].

==General description==
If you sell a mutual fund or stock held in a taxable account for less than the purchase price, you have a capital loss, and you can usually report this as a loss and subtract it from your income.  However, if you sold the shares and then bought them right back, or bought new shares and then immediately sold the old shares, the IRS will rule that you did not really sell them, and will not allow you to deduct the loss at that time.

===IRS definition===
A wash sale occurs when you sell or trade stock or securities ''at a loss'' and within 30 days before or after the sale you:&lt;ref name="pub550"&gt;[https://www.irs.gov/publications/p550#en_US_2018_publink100010601 Wash Sales], IRS Publication 550. Viewed 11 March 2020.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;"''at a loss''"; if you sell at a gain, you cannot have a wash sale, and must report the gain on your taxes even if you buy back the same stock later.&lt;/ref&gt;

#Buy substantially identical stock or securities,&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The tax code only uses the term "acquire", not "buy".&lt;/ref&gt;
# Acquire substantially identical stock or securities in a fully taxable trade,
#Acquire a contract or option to buy substantially identical stock or securities, or
#Acquire substantially identical stock for your individual retirement account (IRA) or Roth IRA.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;This line, which was added in the 2008 version of Pub 550, is missing reference to securities, i.e. "stock or securities".&lt;/ref&gt;

26 U.S. Code § 1091 provides the official text for wash sale rules.&lt;ref name="code1091"&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/1091 Loss from wash sales of stock or securities], Cornell Law School.

Viewed 10 September 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; clarifies that § 1091 does indeed apply to replacement purchases in IRA and Roth IRA accounts and states that "This ruling does not address any issues other than those specifically addressed herein". RR 2008-05 referenced Security First Nat'l Bank v. Commissioner,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/4713384/security-first-national-bank-of-los-angeles-v-commissioner/ Security First Nat'l Bank v.

Viewed 14 November 2022.&lt;/ref&gt; which involved a taxpayer attempting to use a corporate account to evade the wash sale law.

The IRS has not specifically ruled that other tax sheltered accounts, such as [[401(k)]] or [[403(b)]] accounts, are exempt from wash sale rules.&lt;ref&gt;[https://obliviousinvestor.com/wash-sales-in-a-401k-and-wash-sales-with-mutual-funds/ Wash Sales in a 401k and Wash Sales with Mutual Funds], Oblivious Investor.

If you sell stock and your spouse or a corporation you control buys substantially identical stock, you also have a wash sale.&lt;ref name="pub550" /&gt;

If your loss was disallowed because of the wash sale rules, add the disallowed loss to the cost of the new stock or securities (except in tax sheltered accounts&lt;ref name="rr0805" /&gt;). The result is your basis in the new stock or securities. This adjustment postpones the loss deduction until the disposition of the new stock or securities. Your holding period for the new stock or securities includes the holding period of the stock or securities sold.&lt;ref name="code1223"&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/1223 Holding period of property], Cornell Law School. Viewed 20 January 2022.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pub550" /&gt;

== Consequences ==
If you have a wash sale, you do not deduct the loss immediately, but you add the loss to your basis in the new shares, so that you can deduct the loss when you sell those shares.  It is still better to take the loss earlier, as it produces an immediate benefit; in addition, a wash sale negates the value of [[ tax loss harvesting]].

For example, you bought 100 shares of a mutual fund at $40.  On March 1, you sold 100 shares at $30.  On March 10, you bought 100 shares at $35.  Your sale on March 1 was a wash sale, so you could not deduct the $1,000 loss at the time, but your basis in the March 10 shares is $4,500, not $3,500, so you will reduce your capital gains or increase your losses when you sell those shares.

If you have a wash sale and the replacement shares are a tax-sheltered account, such as an [[Traditional IRA|IRA]] or [[Roth IRA]], you will lose all benefit from the capital loss&lt;ref name="rr0805" /&gt; (there is no mechanism for basis adjustment and you do not pay capital gains tax in a tax-sheltered account).

==Irrelevant wash sales==
A brokerage's computer can report a wash sale when a single transaction is split into two, but this wash sale has no effect on your final position.  For example, you bought 100 shares of stock on February 1 at $40, and 100 shares on March 1 at $45.  You sell both lots on March 10 at $35.  The brokerage first records the sale of the February 1 lot, creating a wash sale with the March 1 lot; the $500 loss is not deductible at the time but the basis of the March 1 lot is increased to $5,000.  The brokerage then records the sale of the March 1 lot, for a capital loss of $1,500, the same total as if there had been no wash sale.

==How to avoid wash sales ==
You can avoid a wash sale by avoiding either criterion: either make sure that you buy any replacement shares at least 31 days before or after the sale, or buy replacement shares that are not substantially identical.

===30-day limit===
To avoid the 30-day limit,&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The limit is in calendar days, not business or trading days. See: [https://web.archive.org/web/20170420045235/http://www.fairmark.com:80/capgain/wash/ws101.htm Wash Sales 101], from Fairmark.com&lt;/ref&gt; do not reinvest dividends or capital gains in your taxable funds.  Otherwise, the reinvestment will cause a wash sale (for at least the shares bought with the reinvestment) if you sell the fund at a loss within 30 days of the distribution; this will affect a sale for eight months of the year if the fund pays dividends quarterly, and at all times if the fund pays dividends monthly.  (If you use [[Specific identification of shares]], you can avoid the effect of a wash sale on a reinvestment in the last 30 days by selling those shares; even if your brokerage says that you have a wash sale, you retain the loss because you sold the replacement shares at the same time.)

If you are [[ tax loss harvesting]], you need to wait at least 31 days before buying the fund back.  For those 31 days, put the money in a [[Money Markets | money market]] or in a similar fund that is not substantially identical.

If the consequences of the wash sale are acceptable in your situation, there is no need for a waiting period and you can sell the replacement shares immediately.&lt;ref&gt;{{Forum post|p=6902467|title=Re: Managing my mom's account|author=ee22bee|date=October 04, 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If you hold the same fund in your IRA as in your taxable account, make sure that there are no recent contributions to that fund if you might want to sell your taxable fund at a loss.  Direct distributions in the IRA to a different fund in the same account.

===Substantially identical===
The IRS does not have a clear definition of substantially identical; it is determined by all the facts and circumstances in a particular case.  Two share classes of the same fund, such as a mutual fund and a corresponding ETF, are probably substantially identical, since they are as close to identical as possible, without being identical.  There is no ruling on whether two funds operated by different companies tracking the same index are substantially identical; tax experts have differing opinions. The Supreme Court ruled that the IRS cannot use the concept of an "economic substitute" in determining if two investments are substantially identical.&lt;ref&gt;[https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/499/554/ Cottage Savings Ass'n v. Commissioner, 499 U.S. 554 (1991)], Supreme Court, Viewed 8 February 2022.&lt;/ref&gt; Two funds tracking different indexes, or an index fund and an actively managed fund in the same asset class, should not be substantially identical, though there is no definitive IRS ruling.  [https://advisors.vanguard.com/insights/article/benefitingfromtaxlossharvesting Vanguard's article on tax loss harvesting] suggests that the risk may also be higher with funds from the same provider, so that selling a Vanguard fund to buy a Vanguard fund tracking a similar index is more likely to be a wash sale than selling a Vanguard fund to buy a Fidelity fund tracking a similar index.  However, Vanguard's recommendation of funds which its advisory service might recommend to avoid wash sales
&lt;ref name="surrogate"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20220615183523/https://www.vanguard.com/pdf/washfund.pdf], Vanguard, archived by Wayback Machine and viewed 29 November 2023&lt;/ref&gt; includes many similar Vanguard indexes.

Therefore, when [[ tax loss harvesting]], if you do not put the proceeds of your sale in a money market fund for the 31-day waiting period, you will need to find a similar fund that does not qualify as substantially identical.  It's important to switch into a fund that you are comfortable holding.  If the market goes up after you tax loss harvest, you should plan to hold the new fund for a year in order to get the less costly long term capital gains tax treatment on your sale.

You can also reduce the risk of wash sales with your IRA by not holding substantially identical funds there and in your taxable account; if you have an S&amp;P 500 index in your IRA, you can hold [{{Vf | 0085}} Vanguard Total Stock Market] or [{{Vf | 0307}} Vanguard Large Cap Index] instead of [{{Vf | 0040}} Vanguard 500 Index Fund] in your taxable account.

==Fund alternatives==

The [{{Vf | 0085}} Vanguard Total Stock Market] and [{{Vf | 0307}} Vanguard Large Cap Index] track different indexes, but the returns are similar, and as such, they are good alternatives for domestic holdings. [{{Vf | 0113}} Vanguard Total International Stock Market] and [{{Vf | 0770}} Vanguard FTSE All World Ex-US] also have similar performance while tracking different indexes.  Vanguard has a list which its advisory service may recommend.&lt;ref name="surrogate" /&gt;
 
If you hold ETFs, [https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239513/ishares-dow-jones-us-etf iShares Dow Jones U.S. Index (IYY)] is a good substitute for [{{Vf | 0970}} Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI)], and [https://www.spdrs.com/product/fund.seam?ticker=CWI SPDR MSCI ACWI ex-US (CWI)] is a good substitute for [{{Vf | 0991}} Vanguard FTSE All-World ex-US ETF (VEU)].  Non-Vanguard ETFs have higher expense ratios and track different indexes than Vanguard ETFs, but their performance should be nearly identical to their Vanguard equivalents. There are [[bid/ask spread]]s and commissions associated with buying and selling ETFs, and those costs have to be considered when deciding on your short-term replacement holding.

==Tax-exempt funds==
Although not a wash sale, there is a special rule for tax exempt funds that have been held less than 6 months and which have distributed dividends, which acts like a wash sale, but can actually be more punitive: [https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Tax_loss_harvesting#Fine_points_about_tax_loss_harvesting Fine points about tax loss harvesting].

==Related party transactions==
Although not a wash sale, related party transactions are similar in that a deduction for a loss can be permanently disallowed if the transaction occurs between related parties.  26 U.S. Code § 267&lt;ref name="code267”"&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/267 Losses, expenses, and interest with respect to transactions between related taxpayers], Cornell Law School. Viewed 11 December 2021.&lt;/ref&gt; provides the official text for related party transactions.  Publication 550&lt;ref name="pub550" /&gt; also provides details on related party transactions.

Relevant differences between wash sales and related party transactions are the following:
# Replacement share purchases, which trigger a wash sale, are limited to a +-30 day window around the sale for a loss. There is no similar time window for related party transactions.
#If a wash sale occurs, the basis of the replacement shares is adjusted to account for the loss, unless the replacement shares are in a tax-advantaged account. There is no similar basis adjustment mechanism for related party transactions, although the related party can deduct the loss off any realized gains when those shares are subsequently sold.
#There is a coincidental transaction exception for related party transactions, which is not present for wash sales:
{{blockquote|&lt;b&gt;Indirect transactions.&lt;/b&gt; You cannot deduct your loss on the sale of stock through your broker if, under a prearranged plan, a related party buys the same stock you had owned. This does not apply to a trade between related parties through an exchange that is purely coincidental and is not prearranged.|IRS publication 550&lt;ref name="pub550" /&gt;}}
There is some debate about whether transactions involving a spouse should be a wash sale or a related party transaction.&lt;ref&gt;[https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/331/694/ McWilliams v. Commissioner, 331 U.S. 694 (1947)], Supreme Court, Viewed 11 December 2021.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;See also: {{Forum post| t=27135| title=Wash Sale Uh-Oh}}. Viewed 11 December 2021.&lt;/ref&gt; Spouses are not mentioned in the wash sale code (Section 1091), but they are in the related party transaction code (Section 267). Spouses (and corporations that the taxpayer controls) are listed in both the wash sale and related party transaction sections of IRS Publication 550. Section 267 states that the related party transaction rule does not apply if the loss is disallowed due to the wash sale rule.

==IRS source documents==
From 26 U.S. Code § 1091:&lt;ref name="code1091" /&gt;

{{blockquote|(a) DISALLOWANCE OF LOSS DEDUCTION&lt;br&gt;
In the case of any loss claimed to have been sustained from any sale or other disposition of shares of stock or securities where it appears that, within a period beginning 30 days before the date of such sale or disposition and ending 30 days after such date, the taxpayer has acquired (by purchase or by an exchange on which the entire amount of gain or loss was recognized by law), or has entered into a contract or option so to acquire, substantially identical stock or securities, then no deduction shall be allowed under section 165 unless the taxpayer is a dealer in stock or securities and the loss is sustained in a transaction made in the ordinary course of such business. For purposes of this section, the term “stock or securities” shall, except as provided in regulations, include contracts or options to acquire or sell stock or securities.|Primary paragraph from 26 U.S. Code § 1091&lt;ref name="code1091" /&gt;}}

==Examples of 'substantially identical'==
The following examples were pulled from a white paper from G2FinTech.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20190225084932/http://g2ft.com/papers/G2FTAdvancedTopicsinWashSales_SubstantiallyIdenticalBonds.pdf Advanced Topics in Wash Sales: Substantially Identical Bonds], G2FinTech, Viewed 25 October 2022.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Substantially identical===

Commissioner, 38 B.T.A. 811 (B.T.A. 1938)], United States Board of Tax Appeals, Viewed 25 October 2022.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/1478038/hanlin-v-commissioner-of-internal-revenue/ Hanlin v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 108 F.2d 429 (3rd Cir. 1939)], Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, Viewed 25 October 2022.&lt;/ref&gt; found the following pairs of bonds to be substantially identical, where the only difference between the bonds is as noted:
# City of Philadelphia bonds, issued in 1918, maturing in May and November, 1948.
# City of Philadelphia bonds, issued in 1919, maturing on March 1, 1949.

# Federal Land Bank of Omaha bonds maturing July 1, 1953, redeemable after July 1, 1933.
# Federal Land Bank of Omaha bonds maturing January 1, 1956, also redeemable after July 1, 1933.

* IRS Revenue Ruling 1958-211 found the following bonds to be substantially identical:
# U.S. Treasury 2 1/4 percent coupon (bearer) bonds maturing December 15, 1962, but callable on and after December 15, 1959
# U.S. Treasury 2 1/4 percent registered bonds, maturing June 15, 1962, but callable on and after June 15, 1959

===Not substantially identical===

* Hanlin v Commissioner (1938, 1939) also found the following bonds to be not substantially identical:
# Federal Land Bank of Louisville bonds maturing July 1, 1953, redeemable after July 1, 1933
# Federal Land Bank of St. Louis bonds maturing January 1, 1954, of which $10,000 par value were redeemable after July 1, 1934
# Federal Land Bank of Wichita bonds maturing January 1, 1954, and carrying no advance redemption date

* IRS Revenue Ruling 1958-210 found the following bonds to be not substantially identical, where one of the bonds is redeemable for application to the taxpayer’s tax obligation due from a deceased owner’s estate and the other is not. Also, one bond is available for investment by commercial banks at the time the bonds were purchased and sold, and the other bond does not become so until 14 years later.:
# 2 1/2 percent treasury bonds maturing in September of 1972
# 2 1/2 percent treasury bonds maturing in December of 1972

* IRS Revenue Ruling 1959-44 found that bonds from different local housing authorities, issued under agreement with the federal government, were determined to be not substantially identical, even though they were both backstopped by the federal government and would be substantially identical if issued by the same local housing authority. 

* IRS Revenue Ruling 1960-195 found the following bonds to be not substantially identical:
# Richmond-Petersburg Turnpike Authority 3.45 percent Revenue Bonds.
# Richmond-Petersburg Turnpike Authority 4.5 percent Revenue Bonds.

* IRS Revenue Ruling 1976-346 found the following bonds to be not substantially identical:
# U.S. Treasury 63/8 (7 7/8) percent bonds maturing in 1982 and not redeemable at par.
# U.S. Treasury 41/4 (10 1/4) percent bonds maturing in 1992 and redeemable at par.

The '''ACA''' (Affordable Care Act) 3.8% surtax on Net Investment Income (NII) is imposed on threshold income amounts that are dependent upon filing status and the make-up of a taxpayer's income.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The NIIT applies at a rate of 3.8 percent to certain net investment income of individuals, estates and trusts that have income above the statutory threshold amounts. Estates and Trusts will be subject to the Net Investment Income Tax if they have undistributed Net Investment Income and also have adjusted gross income over the dollar amount at which the highest tax bracket for an estate or trust begins for such taxable year (this threshold amount is $12,500 for 2017 and $12,700 for 2018). See: [http://www.irs.gov/uac/Newsroom/Net-Investment-Income-Tax-FAQs Net Investment Income Tax FAQs]&lt;/ref&gt; For individual taxpayers, the 3.8% surtax applies to the lesser of (1) the modified adjusted gross income above the threshold or (2) the net investment income. These income categories break down as follows:

+ Rent and royalty income &lt;br&gt;
+ Nonqualified annuities &lt;br&gt;
+ Income from businesses that are passive activities to the taxpayer &lt;br&gt;
– Expenses directly allocated to the production of these income sources
|}

Interest from tax-exempt municipal bonds is not included in net investment income.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Also not included are wages, unemployment compensation; operating income from a nonpassive business, Social Security Benefits, alimony, tax-exempt interest, self-employment income, Alaska Permanent Fund Dividends, and distributions from qualified plans: 401(a), 403(a), 403(b), 408, 408A, or 457(b). See: [http://www.irs.gov/uac/Newsroom/Net-Investment-Income-Tax-FAQs Net Investment Income Tax FAQs]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tables==
The tables below show the levels of investment income/ adjusted gross income that taxpayers can recognize without triggering the surtax for given levels of investment income or other earnings. The threshold amounts reflect the tax filing differences ($250,000 for married filing jointly/surviving spouse with dependents; $200,000 for single/head of household; and $125,000 for married filing separately). The threshold amounts are not indexed to inflation.

Keep in mind that gross income&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/61| title=26 U.S. Code § 61 - Gross income defined| publisher=Legal Information Institute| accessdate=June 27, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt; and adjusted gross income&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/62| title=26 U.S. Code § 62 - Adjusted gross income defined| publisher=Legal Information Institute| accessdate=June 27, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt; are not always equivalent. Some common ways taxpayers reduce gross income include:

*Contributions to [[Employer Retirement Plans Overview|employer provided retirement plans]];
*Contributions to [[Traditional IRA|traditional IRA]] plans;
*Pre-tax contributions to [[Flexible spending arrangement | flexible spending arrangements]], [[Health savings account| health savings accounts]], and health, dental, and disability insurance programs;
*Up to $3,000 a year of long-term capital losses.

Special areas of taxpayer caution involve spikes in income that can push the taxpayer beyond the surtax threshold. Examples of such income spikes include:&lt;ref name="CCH"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.cchgroup.com/media/wk/taa/pdfs/news-and-insights/federal-tax-legislation/2014_year-end-planning.pdf| title=CCH Tax Briefing 2014 Year-end Tax Planning| publisher=CCH Incorporated| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141114024338/http://www.cchgroup.com/media/wk/taa/pdfs/news-and-insights/federal-tax-legislation/2014_year-end-planning.pdf| archive-date=November 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* A taxable inheritance distribution from an estate;
* Rollover IRA [[Roth IRA conversion|conversions]] to a Roth IRA.

Trusts and estates should distribute income to beneficiaries rather than retain the income in the trust or estate and incur the ACA surtax at the low trust and estate threshold ($12,950 for 2019 and $13,150 for 2020).&lt;ref name="CCH"/&gt;

Tax is one of the biggest expenses to you as an investor. You might need several of the techniques outlined below to get the best after-tax return from your investments. This list is not exhaustive.

== General overview==
===Withholding===
{{See also|Payroll deductions|Estimated tax}}
If you are employed and receive a salary, it is important to set your tax withholding on your salary so that is about right; that is, close to what you would owe. (Otherwise, where you do not have tax withheld from a salary, you want to be sure to pay the right amount of [[estimated tax]].)

If you significantly &lt;u&gt;underpay&lt;/u&gt; your tax, you might face in an underpayment penalty. The IRS applies this if you pay less than 90% of what you owe, and less than 100% (or 110%, depending on income), of your tax liability for the previous year.

On the other hand, you do not want to significantly &lt;u&gt;overpay&lt;/u&gt; your tax and receive a large refund. This is effectively an interest-free loan to the government, and it might take a while to get your money back, in particular if something goes wrong.

IRS [https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-w-4 Form W-4] is the way you adjust your employer's tax withholding. You give this to your employer, not to the IRS. (If your employer does not withhold tax from your salary, you can choose how much to pay in [[estimated tax]].)

===Withholding safe harbors===
[[Estimated tax#Safe harbors|Safe harbors]] are another way to avoid underpayment penalties. From IRS [https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-1040-es Form 1040-ES, Estimated Tax for Individuals]:

{{blockquote|... you can ''avoid'' a federal underpayment penalty if ''either'' 
1. You owe less than $1,000 in tax, after subtracting your withholding and refundable credits, ''or''&lt;br&gt;
2. Your withholding and refundable credits are greater than the ''smaller'' of:
:a) 90% of the tax for this year's return, or
:b) 100% of the tax on your previous year's return (only if the previous year's return is for 12 months).}}
The "100%" applies to most people, but can be higher or lower for others. See IRS [https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-1040-es Form 1040-ES] for details. Rules are more complicated when you make estimated tax payments. For more, see IRS [https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-2210 Form 2210, Underpayment of Estimated Tax].

===State tax withholding===
If your state has an [[State income taxes|income tax]], check your employer's state tax withholding as well as your federal tax withholding.

If you do not give your employer a state withholding form, most states will default to using the numbers you supplied for federal withholding. However, this often leads to the wrong amount of state tax withheld, either over or under, because state and federal deductions may differ, or because of different tax or other allowances.

A state's income tax withholding "safe harbors" may also differ from those for federal income tax.

===Deductions and credits===
Claim all deductions and credits that you can legally claim. For example, [[saver's credit]] and [[foreign tax credit]]. (There are many others that are unrelated to investment.)

===Tax-efficient fund placement===
{{See also|Principles of tax-efficient fund placement}}
Put tax-inefficient investments in your tax-advantaged accounts. Some fund types, like total market stock index funds, are extremely tax-efficient, because they produce low dividends (that are mostly qualified) and capital gains. By contrast, bond funds can be extremely tax-inefficient.

For more, see: [[Principles of tax-efficient fund placement]]

===Other notes===
Paying the lowest tax does not necessarily mean the highest after-tax return; a better return can overcome a higher tax rate. You could hold a tax-exempt bond fund in a taxable account and a stock fund in a tax-advantaged account, but that may not necessarily be better than holding a taxable bond fund in a tax-advantaged account and a stock fund in a taxable account.

Keep up with tax laws. See [[Tax news sources]] for more details.

Look closely at your own individual situation. The ideas in this article apply to many investors, but they may not work for you specifically. For example, perhaps your employer's [[401(k)]] offers only very expensive funds. If you plan to stay with this employer for many years, then unless your employer offers a generous match on your contributions, it may be better to opt out of that plan.

== Tax-advantaged accounts ==
Tax-advantaged accounts either [[#Tax_deferral|defer taxes]] to the future, or let you grow your investments entirely tax-free.

===Tax-deferred accounts===
Make as much use as possible of tax-advantaged accounts such as [[Roth IRA]], [[Traditional IRA]], [[401(k)]], [[403(b)]], [[457(b)]], [[Health savings account]], and [[:Category:529 plans | 529]] plans. If you are self employed, you might consider a [[SEP | SEP IRA]] or solo 401(k).

You may or may not want to make non-deductible contributions to a Traditional IRA. For more, see: [[Non-deductible Traditional IRA]].

===Roth IRA vs. traditional IRA===
Hold funds with high growth potential in a Roth IRA, and hold other funds in a Traditional IRA, and in other pre-tax accounts like 401(k)s. This means you make the best use of your Roth IRA space.

===Roth conversion during a low-income period===
{{See also|Roth conversion}}
If you are retired with a sizable taxable account, you may be selling shares that you recently bought in your taxable account just before you retired. That generates low taxable income, because the proceeds from selling recently purchased shares are mostly non-taxable return of capital.

Where your income is currently low, gradual Roth conversions might be useful, at least provided you can stay in the lower tax brackets. Roth conversions will help to reduce your tax later from [[Required Minimum Distribution vs annuitization|Required Minimum Distribution]]s.

Whether a tax bracket is high or not depends somewhat on your situation, and in particular what you estimate or expect your tax rates might be in future.

If you are between jobs, or at school or college, you might also consider Roth conversions, provided that you have enough money to pay for your living expenses and the tax for the Roth conversion. See [https://web.archive.org/web/20210125163202/https://fairmark.com/retirement/roth-accounts/roth-conversions/post-retirement-roth-conversion/ Post-Retirement Roth Conversion] from Fairmark.com (archive copy).

===Saver's credit===
The government offers [[saver's credit]] to low-income investors saving into retirement plans such as IRAs or 401(k)s. For this to apply, you need to meet some age and income eligibility criteria.

==Tax deferral==
{{anchor|Tax deferment}}
Several of the tax-advantaged accounts mentioned above are tax-deferred. Tax deferral means that you pay the taxes you owe on an investment in a future year, rather than in the current year. 

You might be unclear about why deferring taxes is a good idea, in particular if you expect to be in the same tax bracket in the future. The table below shows a hypothetical example, comparing annual tax to deferring it for five years.

This example compares $10,000 invested with a 6% annual return over five years. It assumes a 25% tax bracket, both during investment on withdrawal. In a tax-deferred account (such as a [[Traditional IRA]]) tax is paid when the investor withdraws the funds, but on the entire, cumulative, amount of gains. In a taxable account, the investor pays 25% tax each year on the gains for that year.

Start with $10,000. After year 1, there is $150 less total return after taxes (compared to the non-taxed amount of $10,600). The effect of annual tax compounds, so that by the end of year 5, the value is higher ($12,462) where tax was deferred than where not ($12,537). Tax was 25% in both cases, but deferring it produced a better investor result.

Having a tax-deferred account has returned $75 more than a taxable account ($12,537 - $12,462).

==Taxable accounts==
Taxable accounts are those where you pay taxes in the current year. There are several ways that you might be able to reduce your tax on these:
* [[Specific identification of shares]] allows you to sell least appreciated shares first. This can reduce your tax liability, especially just after retiring.
* [[Tax loss harvesting]] improves your after-tax return, letting you use a limited amount of capital losses to offset (generally higher) income tax.
* You can take a [[foreign tax credit]] if you invest in an international fund that pays tax in foreign countries.
* In a taxable account, [[Rebalancing|rebalance]] with new money. Taking dividends and capital gains in cash can make this easier.
* If you [[Donating appreciated securities|donate appreciated securities]] you may be able to deduct their full value, including a long-term capital gain. This give a better result than where you face capital gains tax if you sold them before donating.
* Try to avoid buying a fund [[Timing of transactions to reduce taxes|immediately before]] it makes a significant distribution, because you will pay tax on that distribution. However, holding cash comes with an opportunity cost as well as non-qualified dividends. Where a fund distributes dividends annually, you might want to avoid buying it about one month before a distribution or ex-dividend date. Do not worry about the cost for a stock index fund which makes quarterly distributions, as each distribution is usually very small (in the order of 0.5% of the fund asset for a fund with 2% dividend yield).
* You may be able to improve your tax efficiency by [[placing cash needs in a tax-advantaged account]]. This could include your [[emergency fund]] or a home downpayment.

==Hierarchy of tax authority==
The IRS publications are ''not'' the defining authoritative source of information. Authority is based in US law, specifically the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) in [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26 Title 26] of the United States Code (26 U.S.C.).&lt;ref name="IRS"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/privacy-disclosure/tax-code-regulations-and-official-guidance| title=Tax Code, Regulations, and Official Guidance| publisher=IRS| accessdate=August 25, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The official (electronic) source is located here: [https://uscode.house.gov/browse/prelim@title26&amp;edition=prelim Title 26], Office of the Law Revision Counsel of the United States House of Representatives.&lt;br&gt;
The Electronic Code of Federal Regulations [https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title26/26tab_02.tpl Title 26 Internal Revenue (e-CFR)], by the US Government Printing Office, represents codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the departments and agencies of the Federal Government.&lt;/ref&gt;

Treasury regulations ([https://www.govinfo.gov/app/details/CFR-2022-title26-vol1/CFR-2022-title26-vol1-toc-id2 26 C.F.R.]), commonly referred to as ''Federal tax regulations'', pick up where the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) leaves off by providing the official interpretation of the IRC by the U.S. Department of the Treasury.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The US Department of the Treasury's ''Office of Tax Policy'' assists the Secretary and is responsible for developing and implementing tax policies and programs; providing the official estimates of all Government receipts for the President's budget, fiscal policy decisions, and Treasury cash management decisions; establishing policy criteria reflected in regulations and rulings and guiding their preparation with the Internal Revenue Service; negotiating tax treaties for the United States and representing the United States in meetings and work of multilateral organizations dealing with tax policy matters; and providing economic and legal policy analysis for domestic and international tax policy decisions. See: [https://www.treasury.gov/about/organizational-structure/offices/Pages/Tax-Policy.aspx Tax Policy], from the US Department of the Treasury.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to participating in the promulgation of Treasury (Tax) Regulations, the IRS publishes a regular series of other forms of official tax guidance, including revenue rulings, revenue procedures, notices, and announcements. See [https://www.irs.gov/uac/Understanding-IRS-Guidance-A-Brief-Primer Understanding IRS Guidance - A Brief Primer] for more information about official IRS guidance versus non-precedential rulings or advice.&lt;ref name="IRS" /&gt;

The authoritative instrument for the distribution of all forms of official IRS tax guidance is the ''[https://apps.irs.gov/app/picklist/list/internalRevenueBulletins.html Internal Revenue Bulletin] (IRB)'', a weekly collection of these and other items of general interest to the tax professional community.&lt;ref name="IRS" /&gt;

As implied earlier, forms of taxpayer assistance — IRS Publications, forms and form instructions — are provided for guidance only. Taxpayers should not rely solely on such documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.cchgroup.com/media/wk/taa/pdfs/accounting-firms/tax/understanding-irs-rulings-pronouncements-fact-sheet.pdf| title=Tax Research: Understanding Sources of Tax Law (Why my IRC beats your Rev Proc!)

A portion of your [[ordinary dividend]]s may be '''non-qualified dividends''' because they can include items like these:
*'''Taxable interest'''. When a mutual fund receives taxable interest, the income gets paid out as a dividend. It is a dividend when it goes out of the [[mutual fund]], but it was not a dividend when it came into the mutual fund, so it cannot be a qualified dividend.
*'''Non-qualified dividends'''. A mutual fund or [[Exchange-traded fund|ETF]] may distribute dividends that are non-qualified. A fund must hold the security for at least 61 days out of the 121-day period that began 60 days before the security’s [[Dividend#Dates and Timing|ex-dividend date]]. If this requirement is not met, the dividends do not qualify for the long-term [[Capital gains distribution|capital gains]] rate and are treated as ordinary income.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Qualified dividends|url=https://www.fidelity.com/tax-information/tax-topics/qualified-dividends|access-date=July 9, 2025|publisher=Fidelity}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Do ETFs pay dividends?|url=https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/investment-products/etf/dividends-on-etfs|access-date=July 9, 2025|publisher=Fidelity}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note" name=":0"&gt;Certain preferred stock must be held for 91 days out of the 181-day period, beginning 90 days before the ex-dividend date.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Short-term capital gain'''. When a mutual fund or ETF has a short-term capital gain, it pays this amount to the shareholders as an ordinary dividend.
*'''Time period to hold shares'''. To qualify for the long-term capital gains rate, you must own those shares for at least 61 days out of the 121-day period that began 60 days before the security’s ex-dividend date (the same requirement as a fund or stock). Otherwise, the dividend is non-qualified. This requirement applies even if the event is reported to you as a qualified dividend. You do not have to buy the shares 61 days before the dividend is paid, but the total amount of time you hold the shares (including time before and after the dividend) has to be at least 61 days.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" group="note" /&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Stock shares must be held unhedged for at least 61 days out of the 121-day period that began 60 days before the ex-dividend date. "Unhedged" means that no puts, calls, or short sales were associated with the shares during the holding period.&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost all of the dividends distributed by [[REIT |equity REITS]] come in the form of non-qualified dividends. You pay tax on non-qualified dividends at marginal income tax rates.

If you have a sizable taxable account, it is possible to '''place a cash needs requirement''', such as an [[Emergency fund | emergency fund]] or home down payment, '''in a tax-advantaged account''' and improve the overall tax efficiency of an investment portfolio.

{{Notice|
Placing emergency funds in volatile accounts can be risky. Consider that the stock market may drop 50% when you need the money the most, forcing you to withdraw from the tax-advantaged account.&lt;ref&gt;{{forum link| t=65387| title=Emergency funds| date=December 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the taxable account should be twice as large as your cash needs. If it is smaller, keep a proportional portion of your cash needs in cash.
}}

==How it works==

Suppose you have $15,000 in your portfolio with additional $5,000 as an emergency fund. Then you could have:

* Taxable&lt;br&gt;$10,000 tax-efficient stock index funds
* Tax-advantaged account, such as [[401(k)]]&lt;br&gt;$5,000 money market fund (your emergency fund)&lt;br&gt;$5,000 bond fund

Now, suppose you need $5,000 in an emergency. You sell $5,000 from the stock index funds in your taxable account and exchange the money market fund for similar stock funds in your tax-advantaged account. You are left with:

* Taxable&lt;br&gt;$5,000 tax-efficient stock index funds
* Tax-advantaged account, such as 401(k)&lt;br&gt;$5,000 stock funds&lt;br&gt;$5,000 bond fund

Notice that you have not changed the asset allocation at all.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;
''White Coat Investor'' commented in this {{Forum link| p=2686420| title=Buying a house in 2-4 years; what do I do with my mutual funds?}} on the transfer from an existing investment in equity to a safer option for a house down payment:
{{blockquote|The main thing is to consider your options in the event of a huge bear market. If the market drops 50%, what will you do? Here are some choices:

# Don't buy the house and just keep renting until the stocks recover and future savings gets you back to where you want to be.
# Maybe houses will be cheaper in an economic downturn and you can still buy it with your decreased amount.
# Maybe houses will be cheaper and you can use a mortgage with &lt; 20% down, leaving your investments intact.
# Maybe you won't buy a house at all.

For some people, for whom these options aren't good choices, should sell their stocks now and put the money in CDs. But there are many people for whom these other options are very realistic alternatives. For them, keeping some or all of the money in stocks is probably okay. The expected return is higher, even if the actual return may not be.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Why it works==
 
The tax efficiency of holding your cash needs in a tax-advantaged account comes in two forms.

===While you do not need the cash===
While you do not need the cash, tax-efficient stock index funds generally yield 2% or so, which are all or mostly qualified dividends; most of the return is from capital gains which are not taxed until you sell. Depending on the interest rate, a typical money market fund yields anywhere from 2% to 5%, and the dividends are all non-qualified dividends. In addition, you can [[Tax loss harvesting | tax loss harvest]] the stock funds.

===When you need the cash===
When you sell a part of the tax-efficient stock index funds, you realize either losses or long-term capital gains. You can deduct losses on your tax return after offsetting capital gains, if any. Long-term capital gains are taxed more favorably than non-qualified dividends.

==Candidates for tax-efficient stock index funds==
The following funds are good candidates in which to invest cash needs, but there are others that are just as good.

US Domestic:
* Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund
* Vanguard Large-Cap Index Fund

International:
* Vanguard Total International Stock Market Index Fund
* Vanguard FTSE All-World ex-US Index Fund

The [[Principles of tax-efficient fund placement]] article prefers placing international stocks in the taxable account. Each pair is suitable for [[Tax loss harvesting | tax loss harvesting]] and avoiding [[wash sale | wash sales]].

==Fine points==

Use [[Specific identification of shares]]. Sell tax lots with losses or tax lots with the highest cost basis that have long-term capital gains. If you do not use [[Specific identification of shares]], it is difficult to minimize tax. In some cases, you might pay more tax on short-term capital gains than on ordinary income, which negates the benefit of placing cash needs in a tax-advantaged account. For this reason, you may want to wait for twelve months before you place cash needs in a tax-advantaged account if you are starting a taxable account now.

Avoid a [[wash sale]]. If you sell shares of the tax-efficient stock index funds with losses and buy "substantially identical" securities in your tax-advantaged account (within 30 days before or after the sale), that is a wash sale. You cannot deduct losses at all in this case. Therefore, you need to find a fund which is not substantially identical to purchase in your tax-advantaged account; preferably, it should be similar, such as an active fund in the same asset class as the index, or a fund tracking a different index. If you prefer to hold the original fund in your tax-advantaged account, you may switch after 31 days.

Make sure your taxable account is large enough. Keep in mind that the stock market tanking by 50% is not uncommon. If your taxable account is not large enough, say twice as large as the cash needs, then you may not have enough money in your taxable account during a market downturn. The market could actually go down by '''more''' than 50%, and that is a risk of this technique if the taxable account does not provide enough cushion. For this reason, you may be able to keep a small amount of cash needs (for example, enough for an emergency) in tax-efficient stock index funds, but you may not want to keep a large amount of cash needs (for example, a home down payment fund) in such potentially volatile investments, unless you have a very large taxable retirement portfolio.

A '''return of capital distribution''' (IRS terminology refers to these distributions as "nondividend distributions") differ from ordinary dividends in that they are not made out of earnings, but are made out of capital. Mutual funds are one of the business entities which can make a return of capital distribution.  When an investment is held in a taxable account, these distributions are, under most circumstances, non-taxable. The distribution reduces the tax basis of the fund. Thus, the distribution is taxed at capital gains tax rates when an investor sells fund shares. If the return of capital distributions are larger than the tax basis of shares, the distribution is taxed as a capital gain. 

:''Example'': An investor holds a stock with a $10 basis. The investor receives a $2 return of capital dividend. The $2 dividend is not taxable income. The investor reduces the basis of the stock to $8 dollars. If the investor sells the stock for $10, the $2 profit will be reported as a taxable gain and will be taxed as either a short term or long term gain depending on how long the investor has held the stock.

==Adjusting basis==
When you receive a return of capital distribution it will be reported on line 3 of the 1099-DIV. According to Fairmark, take the following steps to adjust basis:

*If you're using the single-category averaging method to determine your basis.  Find the amount in box 3 of Form 1099-DIV and subtract that amount from the total basis of your shares.
*If you're using any other method to determine your basis:
#Start with the amount in box 3 of Form 1099-DIV.
#Divide that figure by the number of shares to which it applies. This tells you the amount of the adjustment per share.
#Use this per-share basis adjustment to decrease the basis of each separate group of shares you hold. &lt;ref&gt; [http://fairmark.com/mutual/nontax.htm Nondividend Distributions], Fairmark &lt;/ref&gt;

==Vanguard funds making return of capital distributions==
Vanguard has a number of funds which are prone to make return of capital distributions.
* '''Real Estate funds''': The Vanguard REIT Index Fund and Vanguard Global ex-U.S. Real Estate Index Fund. In the case of equity REIT funds, the return of capital distribution mainly reflects the  accounting value of real estate depreciation (operating earnings are in excess of earnings including depreciation). As most dividends distributed by equity REITS are [[Non-qualified dividends | non-qualified]] dividends, taxed at marginal rates, the return  of capital dividend serves, for taxable account investors, to both defer taxation and to switch the taxation of the distribution from marginal rates to usually lower capital gains rates.
* '''Managed Payout Fund''': As a part of the Vanguard Managed Payout Fund's managed distribution policy, monthly income distributions can come from dividends, realized capital gains, and return of capital.
* '''Inflation-Protected Securities Fund''': Mutual funds which hold [[TIPS]] are required to distribute as dividends both the coupon on the bond and the inflation adjustment. In some quarters, deflation is more than the bond yield, and thus the amount Vanguard Inflation-Protected Securities Fund needs to distribute for the year is less after the fourth quarter than after preceding quarters. The fund makes no distribution, and recharacterizes part of the dividend as a return of capital so that the dividends for the full year are the correct amount. Historically, the fund has made return of capital distributions in the 2007 and 2016 fiscal years.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' do not always work the same way as Federal taxes. Understanding the differences specific to your state may be useful in making investment plans, and people giving advice to investors in other states need to know other state-specific issues. This page is a summary of the major differences between state and federal taxes, with links to each state's tax page. If your state is not listed on this page and you know something about the state tax, please add it.

==All states==
In most states with an income tax, the tax works essentially the same as the Federal tax. You compute your total income, subtract itemized deductions or a standard deduction. subtract personal exemptions (or, in some states, take a dollar credit for personal exemptions), and pay a tax based on the tax rate; the only difference is that certain items are taxed differently. States in which the tax works in a very different way (for example, no standard deduction and only limited itemized deductions, or only some types of income taxed) will be indicated below.

Massachusetts has added a surtax to very high incomes on top of their otherwise flat tax.&lt;ref name="MassSurtax"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.mass.gov/news/4-surtax-on-taxable-income-over-1000000-the-basics#:~:text=What%20is%20the%204%25%20surtax,for%20the%20tax%20year%202023.| title=4% Surtax on Taxable Income Over $1,000,000: The Basics| publisher=Massachusetts Department of Revenue| date=January 26, 2024| accessdate=August 20, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interest and dividends===
States cannot tax the Federal Government; therefore, interest on Government obligations, such as [[Treasury bonds]] and [[TIPS]] (but not [[GNMA]]s), is exempt from state tax. On the other hand, most states do tax obligations of other states, so income from [[municipal bonds]] from other states is exempt from Federal tax but subject to state tax. In most states, if a fund contains a mixture of taxable and tax-exempt income (for example, a bond fund holding both Treasury and corporate bonds), the tax-exempt income is not taxed by the state; some states require a minimum percentage of the fund to be tax-exempt to get any tax benefit.

===Deductions===
Most states do not allow an itemized deduction for state and local taxes, although some allow the deduction for taxes paid to other states or out-of-state localities, some allow deduction for their own state, and some do allows a deduction for taxes paid to all states. A few states allow a deduction for Federal taxes, which significantly reduces the effective tax rate.

===Multiple state tax issues===
States that impose a personal income tax generally require that tax be paid on all income earned in that state, as well as all income earned by residents of the state. This may result in the need to pay taxes to multiple states, but there are provisions to reduce both the tax and the paperwork burden.

====Reciprocity with neighboring states====
For employees who work in one state but live in another, a tax return must be filed in both states. To alleviate this double filing burden, many neighboring states have agreements not to tax salaries earned by each other's residents. This makes taxes easier to handle for commuters, as most commuters have no income earned in the other state except for salaries.

Generally, under these agreements, one state will not tax a resident of the other state on compensation that is subject to employer withholding. These agreements apply to most types of W-2 compensation earned while a resident of the reciprocal compensation agreement state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.revenue.pa.gov/TaxTypes/PIT/Pages/Determining-Residency.aspx#:~:text=What%20are%20reciprocal%20tax%20agreements,compensation%20subject%20to%20employer%20withholding| title=Determining Residency for PA Personal Income Tax Purposes| publisher=Pennsylvania Department of Revenue| accessdate=August 20, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.nj.gov/treasury/taxation/njit25.shtml| title=NJ Income Tax - PA/NJ Reciprocal Income Tax Agreement| publisher=NJ Treasury| accessdate=August 20, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt; For convenience, an employer ''may'' withhold taxes at the employee's resident state tax rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://revenue-pa.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/270/related/1/session/L2F2LzQvdGltZS8xMjk2NDIxMTM5L3NpZC9LVzZPaG9saw%3D%3D| title=Is there any thing I can do if my reciprocal state employer refuses to withhold PA Personal Income Tax?| quote=It is not mandatory for an employer to withhold out of state taxes for non-residents.| date=November 14, 2022| accessdate=August 20, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, a Pennsylvania resident working in New Jersey (Pennsylvania has reciprocal agreements with New Jersey and five other states) could have taxes withheld for Pennsylvania at the Pennsylvania rate. Only a Pennsylvania state tax form is needed; no additional forms are to be filed for New Jersey unless the resident owes New Jersey tax for some other reason (for example, property sold in New Jersey).

====Credit for taxes paid to another state====
If you pay taxes to two states on the same income (because both consider you to be a resident, or because you are a resident of one but earned income in the other), the states allow a credit analogous to the [[foreign tax credit]]. The credit is usually the lesser of the amount you paid to the other state, or a prorated share of the tax you paid to the state where you took the credit. 

For example, if you are a resident of State X with income of $100,000, of which $20,000 was taxable in State Y, and you paid $6,000 in tax to State X, then you are entitled to a $1,200 credit if you paid $1,200 or more to State Y, and otherwise only a credit of the amount you paid to State Y.

====Nonresidents and part-year residents====
Nonresident tax is normally computed on a prorated basis. If you are a nonresident of state Y and have total income of $100,000, of which $20,000 is taxable in State Y, then you compute the State Y tax on the full $100,000, and 20% of the total is your State Y tax.

Some states tax part-year residents the same as non-residents, prorating full-year income. Other states do not prorate. In the example above, if you moved to State Y during the year and earned a total of $100,000, of which $20,000 was earned while you were a resident, and State Y does not prorate, then you would owe the tax on $20,000 rather than 20% of the tax on $100,000. If the tax in State Y is flat, this would not matter, but if the tax is progressive, you would owe much less tax because of the lack of proration.

===Withholding===
If you do not fill out a state withholding form, most states will withhold income tax using the same number of allowances as on the Federal [https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-w-4 W-4 form]. This is often incorrect, either because your itemized deductions and credits are different (since state taxes are not deductible on the state form, and most Federal tax credits do not apply to the states) or because the amount a state assigns to an allowance is different (if a state has a $1,000 personal exemption, then $20,000 of extra itemized deductions is 20 state allowances). Check your state withholding when you file your federal W-4 to avoid getting a large refund or a penalty.

===Use tax===
All states with sales taxes also impose a use tax on goods purchased out of state for use in the state by state residents; sales tax paid to another state can be taken as a credit against that tax. This tax is not part of the income tax, but in many states, there is a line on the income tax form for use tax payments to encourage compliance, and some states provide a formula for estimating the tax due if the taxpayer does not keep records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.house.mn.gov/hrd/pubs/usetax.pdf| title=Use Tax Collection on Income Tax Returns in Other States| publisher=Research Department, Minnesota House of Representatives| date=April 2015| accessdate=August 20, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This section is not intended to be a comprehensive guide to the details of state taxes, just a summary of the most important issues. Go to the state web site or check with a tax advisor for details.

===Specific issues for investors===
This section is a summary of investment strategies which may be affected by state tax issues. See the following section for a more complete summary.

*'''Any state with no income tax''' — Minor preference for Roth over traditional accounts (you may pay tax on traditional account withdrawals if you retire in another state). More attractive to pay down a mortgage (interest not deductible). More attractive to invest in corporate bonds rather than Treasury bonds in a taxable account.

*[https://www.revenue.alabama.gov/tax-types/individual-income-tax/ Alabama] — The first $6,000 per year of 401k or IRA withdrawals is exempt from state income tax for taxpayers 65 and older. 

*[https://www.azdor.gov/ Arizona] — Foreign investments in a taxable account are more attractive, because of a foreign tax credit against state as well as federal tax.

*[https://www.dfa.arkansas.gov/income-tax/individual-income-tax Arkansas] — First $6,000 of retirement plan distributions (per spouse if married) are tax exempt, which may factor into traditional vs Roth decisions. 

*[https://www.ftb.ca.gov/index.shtml California] — Prefer Treasury bonds in a Health Savings Account. Other investments are taxed.

*[https://tax.colorado.gov Colorado] — A slight preference for traditional contributions during working years; some retirement account withdrawals are excludable from income starting at age 55. For the same reason, small Roth conversions after age 55 may be beneficial. 

*[https://revenue.delaware.gov/ Delaware] — A minor advantage for foreign investments in a taxable account, because foreign tax is deductible.

*[https://dor.georgia.gov Georgia] — All except high-income taxpayers should prefer traditional to Roth accounts. Contributions are deductible, and the huge exclusion means that only high-income taxpayers will owe any Georgia tax on the income after age 65. Tax efficiency for middle-income taxpayers while they are still working is more important — capital gains are taxed by Georgia while they are working, but are unlikely to be taxed after 65.

*[https://tax.illinois.gov/questionsandanswers/answer.99.html Illinois] — Illinois does not tax retirement account distributions, which can factor into traditional vs Roth decisions. 

*[https://www.in.gov/dor/ Indiana] — It is more attractive to pay down a mortgage (interest not deductible).

*[https://revenue.louisiana.gov/individualincometax Louisiana] — Louisiana has a small retirement income distribution exemption that may be a factor in traditional vs Roth decisions. 

*[https://www.marylandtaxes.gov/ Maryland] — Prefer not to roll an entire retirement plan into an IRA. Some pension income is excluded from tax but this is lost in an IRA.

*[https://www.mass.gov/dor Massachusetts] — Use banks in Massachusetts in preference to other banks (some Massachusetts interest is not taxed). Prefer Roth to traditional IRA even if traditional would be federally deductible, because there is no state deduction. It is more attractive to pay down a mortgage, since interest is not deductible.

*[https://www.michigan.gov/taxes Michigan] — It is more attractive to pay down a mortgage, since interest not deductible. For taxpayers without pensions, prefer traditional to Roth accounts, as a large amount of retirement income is not taxed. 

*[https://www.dor.ms.gov/individual/individual-income-tax-faqs Mississippi] — Retirement income, including qualified distributions from retirement accounts is not taxed in Mississippi, which is a consideration in traditional vs Roth decisions. 

*[https://www.revenue.nh.gov/taxes-glance/interest-dividends-tax New Hampshire] — Interest and dividend tax phase out after 2024.

*[https://www.state.nj.us/treasury/taxation/ New Jersey] — High-income investors, or investors who might retire in another state, should prefer Roth to traditional accounts except for 401(k)s. Traditional IRA, 403(b), 457, Thrift Savings Plans are not deductible; moderate-income New Jersey investors may be able to exclude the entire income in retirement. All except high-income investors should prefer traditional to Roth 401(k) (deductible, and may not be taxed in retirement). Prefer Treasury bonds in a traditional IRA (not taxed; it is not clear from the instructions whether this applies to other traditional accounts). It is more attractive to pay down a mortgage, because interest is not deductible. Prefer Treasury bonds in a Health Savings Account (other investments are taxed).

*[https://www.tax.ny.gov/pit/ New York] — Prefer to have at least some traditional rather than Roth accounts. Moderate-income taxpayers should prefer traditional to Roth for most retirement income ($20,000 per person excluded).

The [https://www.ncdor.gov/bailey-decision-concerning-federal-state-and-local-retirement-benefits Bailey court decision] limits how much the state can tax certain retirees, including federal pensioners with 5 or more years of creditable service as of August 12, 1989.

*[https://www.oregon.gov/dor/programs/individuals/pages/pit.aspx/ Oregon] — Oregon has one of the highest income tax rates in the nation, up to 9.9% over $125,000.

*[https://www.revenue.pa.gov/TaxTypes/PIT/Pages/default.aspx Pennsylvania] — Minor preference for Roth over traditional accounts. Neither is deductible or taxable in Pennsylvania, but you may pay tax on traditional account withdrawals if you retire in another state. It is more attractive to pay down a mortgage, because interest is not deductible.

*[https://tax.ri.gov/tax-sections/personal-income-tax Rhode Island]  — Those with low or moderate incomes may prefer traditional vs Roth contributions to employer retirement plans (not including IRAs) as some withdrawals are tax exempt. 

*[https://dor.sc.gov/tax/individual-income South Carolina] — modest tax deduction for retirement plan distributions, potentially affecting traditional vs Roth decisions. 

*[https://tax.vermont.gov/individuals/personal-income-tax Vermont]  — Vermont offers a modest retirement account distributions exemption, subject to AGI constraints, that should be considered in traditional vs Roth decisions. 

*[https://www.tax.virginia.gov/ Virginia] — No special issues.

*[https://dor.wa.gov/taxes-rates/other-taxes/capital-gains-tax Washington] — while Washington has no income tax there is currently an excise capital gains tax for very high amounts of capital gains ($262,000 in 2023).

===Tax details===

====Alabama====
[https://www.revenue.alabama.gov/tax-types/individual-income-tax/ Alabama] — Alabama has three income tax brackets, but the brackets are low and most taxpayers reach the top bracket. Capital losses are deducted against income in the year realized, with no limitation and thus no need for carryover.

The first $6,000 of 401k or IRA withdrawals are tax exempt for those 65 years and older. 

Social Security and income from defined-benefit pension plans are not taxed.

$5,000 of contributions to the Alabama 529 Plan is subtracted from income per taxpayer and $10,000 for married filing jointly if both spouses contribute. 

Federal tax is deducted from taxable income in addition to the standard or itemized deductions.

Taxpayers below certain income limits with health insurance through small employers may deduct 100% of their health insurance premiums. 

All federal taxes other than income tax are deductible as itemized deductions; this includes Social Security, Medicare, self-employment tax, and gift tax if paid by the giver. Tax paid to a city or county is deductible from state tax (most states do not allow this).

Qualified long-term care premiums are fully deductible, and other medical expenses in excess of 4% of adjusted gross income are deductible (compared to 7.5% for federal tax).

Part-year resident taxes are not prorated, but this has little effect because the tax rate is almost flat.

Capital gains on Treasury bonds are not taxed; capital gains from funds holding these bonds are taxable. There is a homestead property tax credit for low-income homeowners and renters. 6% of the federal earned income credit is available as a state credit. Michigan House Bill 4001 (signed March 9, 2023) has changed the taxation of retirement income.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.michigan.gov/taxes/iit/retirement-and-pension-benefits| title=Retirement and Pension Benefits| publisher=Michigan Department of Treasury| accessdate=August 20, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The previous law created three retirement income tax systems depending on year of birth. For married couples the controlling year of birth is that of the older spouse. The 2023 law creates a phase-in of the rules for the oldest retirees; by 2026, the tiers will be gone. 

In 2023, 2024, and 2025, retirees born in or before 1958. 1962, and 1966 respectively have the choice of 25%, 50%, or 75% of the benefits from pre-1946 retirees, or the benefits under the previous law. In 2026, all taxpayers 67 or older can use the full pre-1946 exclusion.

Most future retirees (born after 1952) will be able to reduce their Michigan taxable income by the larger of (1) a Personal Exemption plus their federally taxable Social Security income, or (2) an Income Deduction of $20,000 per person starting at age 67. However this Income Deduction is not inflation indexed, while the Personal Exemption and Social Security benefits are increased for inflation. Consequently the Income Deduction will become negligible over time. 

People born between 1946 and 1952 get all three of the above income reductions (Personal Exemption, taxable Social Security, and Income Deduction starting at age 67). Before age 67, they can also use a partial Retirement Income Deduction (RID) of $20,000 per person, which is not inflation adjusted. The RID covers all income from pensions and traditional IRAs. Only a portion of the income from 401(k) and 403(b) plan withdrawals qualifies for the RID: 
* Employer contributions qualify
* Employee contributions made to earn employer matching contributions also qualify.

People born before 1946 are not eligible for the $20,000 per person Income Deduction. Instead, they receive a full Retirement Income Deduction of $56,961 per person (in 2012 dollars), doubled for married filing jointly, which is increased with inflation. They also receive the Personal Exemption and taxable Social Security reduction to their Michigan taxable income.

==Notes==
===For wiki editors - issues to check when adding a state to the list===
Here are some of the more common issues which should be mentioned:
*No income tax, or tax applied only to some types of income (investments but not salary).
*Municipal bonds from other states not taxed.
*State taxes some income excluded from Federal income on W-2 (for example, 401(k) or 403(b) contributions).
*Tax exemptions for Social Security or retirement income.
*Taxation of [[Health savings account]]s.
*Minimum fraction of income or assets in tax-exempt assets for mutual funds to be exempt from state taxes.
*No standard deduction.
*Only specific items may be deducted, rather than most Federal itemized deductions.
*Significant additional deductions such as Federal tax.
*Taxpayers must itemize state deductions if they itemize Federal deductions, or must take state standard deduction if they take Federal standard deduction.
*Different types of income taxed at different rates.
*Credit for taxes paid to foreign countries or localities in those countries.
*Earned income credit.
*Part-year resident income is not prorated, in states with progressive tax rates. (If the tax rate is flat, proration is irrelevant, as the tax on $20,000 is 20% of the tax on $100,000.)

Keep the [[#Specific issues for investors|Specific issues for investors]] section short. Include only issues relevant to a large number of investors, such as non-deductibility of mortgage interest or taxability of different types of investment income. The [[#Tax details|Tax details]] section, which is the last section, can be long if there are important details. For simplicity and to reduce the number of changes needed annually, avoid listing specific numbers (such as the amount of a personal exemption, or the tax rate) unless they are very large or otherwise significant.

A '''capital gains distribution''' occurs when [[mutual fund]]s, [[closed-end funds]], and [[exchange-traded fund]]s (ETFs) distribute the capital gains realized in their investment portfolios to shareholders.

If you hold funds in taxable accounts, these distributions are taxable. Your tax rate depends on how long the fund has held the investment, and also on your own marginal tax rate. The two types of distributions from stock and bond funds are termed short-term gains and long-term gains.{{#tag:ref|Special tax considerations apply to commodity asset classes and fund structures:
*Precious metals and grantor's trusts: the IRS considers precious metals to be collectibles.
*Commodity futures are subject to a 60/40 long term/short term blended tax obligation. Limited partnership ETFs are considered pass-through investments. Each year gains are marked-to-market and passed through to investors as a potential taxable obligation, regardless of whether the shares are sold or held.
* Exchange traded notes based on equity investments are subject to marginal long term capital gains rate or marginal short term income tax rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.indexuniverse.com/docs/110411IU_ETF_Taxation_v5A_%20j9.pdf| title=The Complete Guide to ETF Taxation| publisher=indexuniverse.com| date=November 2011| accessdate=October 31, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group="note"}}

*Short-term capital gains distributions are from gains realized on securities the fund held for one year or less. You pay tax on short-term gains at ordinary income tax rates. Funds usually include short-term gain distributions in their [[Ordinary dividend | ordinary dividend]] distribution. This means that you cannot use capital losses to offset your tax on these distributions.
*Long-term capital gains distributions are from gains realized on securities the fund held for more than one year. You report these on your tax return's Schedule D, along with any other capital gains, and you can reduce them with capital losses.

Typically, funds distribute capital gains near the end of the year, often in December. If you hold funds in taxable accounts, it is usually best to invest in new funds ''after'' a fund has distributed any capital gains. This avoids an unnecessary tax liability.

If you sell shares of a [[stock]], [[bond basics|bond]], [[exchange-traded funds|exchange-traded fund]] (ETF), or [[mutual fund]] in a taxable account, you pay a capital-gains tax on the difference between the ''basis'' (what you paid, with adjustments) and the ''sales price'' (what you sold it for). These transactions are reported in IRS Form 8949: ''basis'' is reported in Column (f), ''Cost or other basis''; ''sales price'' is reported in Column (e), ''Sales price''. 

You must choose an accounting method for each fund you hold in order to determine the basis. [http://www.irs.gov/publications/p550/index.html IRS Publication 550]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irs.gov/publications/p550/index.html IRS Publication 550 Investment Income and Expenses] (direct link: [http://www.irs.gov/publications/p550/ch04.html#en_US_2010_publink100010383 Stocks and Bonds]), has incorporated IRS Publication 564, Mutual Fund Distributions.&lt;br&gt;See [http://www.irs.gov/taxpros/article/0,,id=237099,00.html Cost Basis Reporting Overview and FAQs] for reporting methods starting in 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; describes the three allowed methods for mutual funds.  The methods are of one of two types: cost basis methods and average basis methods. In a cost basis method, every share has its own basis, and the accounting method determines which share you sell.  In an average basis method, the basis of a group of shares is averaged over all the shares.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Average cost can be applied only to mutual funds, stocks that have been designated for the Vanguard Brokerage Services dividend reinvestment program (DRIP), and most ETFs structured as regulated investment companies (RICs). All Vanguard ETFs are registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Ref: [https://personal.vanguard.com/pdf/c103.pdf Cost Basis Method Election Form], Vanguard, viewed December 3, 2017. and {{cite web |url= https://personal.vanguard.com/us/insights/guide/calculating-cost-basis|title= The basics of calculating cost basis|last= |first= |date= |website= Vanguard|publisher= Vanguard|access-date=Dec 3, 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For stocks purchased in 2011 or later, and mutual funds and most ETFs purchased in 2012 or later, the brokerage or mutual fund company is required to do the accounting according to one of these methods, and report data to the IRS; for earlier purchases, the brokerage will not report to the IRS, but you still need to keep your own records in order to report the data on your own tax form. Mutual fund shares bought before 2012 are called noncovered shares, while those bought in 2012 or later are called covered shares.&lt;ref&gt;[https://personal.vanguard.com/us/help/FAQCostBasisContent.jsp FAQs - Cost Basis], from Vanguard.&lt;/ref&gt;

The examples in this page show the different tax effects in the following sample situation:

*Ten years ago, you bought 100 shares at $30.
*Five years ago, you bought 100 shares at $40.
*Six months ago, you bought 100 shares at $50.
*Two months ago, you bought 100 shares at $60.
*Today, you want to sell 100 shares at $60.

==FIFO (first in, first out)==
In this method, the first shares purchased are assumed to be the shares sold.  In the example above, you sell the shares bought ten years ago; since you bought them for $3,000, your basis is $3,000, and your capital gain is $3,000.

This is the default accounting method; the IRS assumes that you used it unless you have records to support another method.  If you have not given your brokerage other instructions and you say "Sell 100 shares" without identifying which 100 shares, the shares will be FIFO.  This method is the simplest, but it usually leads to the largest tax bills if you use it for stock funds, because shares tend to rise in value and the oldest shares will usually be the ones bought for the lowest price.

==Specific share identification==
In this method, you may choose which shares to sell.  You must be able to adequately identify the shares sold.  You may have a standing order such as "Sell highest-cost shares first" or "Sell lowest-cost shares first"; Vanguard, for example, allows you to specify HIFO (highest-in-first-out) for an account.  You may also provide specific identification with every transaction.  If you identify a specific transaction, the IRS says that you can do this if you specify the shares sold to the agent (the broker or mutual fund company) when you make the sale (up to the settlement date, which is two days after the sale date for most stocks), and receive written confirmation from the agent selling the shares.  In the example above, you could choose to sell the 100 shares bought two months ago; your basis in those shares is $6,000, so you have a zero capital gain.

If you hold stock certificates (very rare for mutual funds, and no longer common even for individual stocks), then you specify which shares to sell by which certificate you give to the broker for the sale.  

This method requires the most record-keeping (particularly if your brokerage doesn't make it easy, and Vanguard did not make it easy until the new IRS requirements came into effect), but it allows you to minimize your tax bills, and the tax savings can be very large.  See [[Specific identification of shares]] for more information about the advantages, and details of how to use this method with Vanguard.

==Average basis==
In this method, all of your shares in a mutual fund have the same basis, which is the average cost (or other basis) of all shares at the time they were purchased (adjusted for previous sales followed by subsequent purchases).  Shares are still sold in the order purchased.  In the example above, you paid $18,000 for 400 shares, so your average basis is $45 a share; when you sell 100 shares at $60, your basis is $4500, your sales price is $6000, and the capital gain is $1,500.  It is a long-term gain since you sold the shares you bought ten years ago.  

Once you have averaged shares, they remain averaged for future transactions.  In the example above, your basis is $45 in all 300 remaining shares; if you change to specific identification in the future, you cannot sell shares with a $30 or $60 basis.

For mutual fund shares bought before 2012, and as an option in the future, Vanguard provides the records for using this method.  If you use another method, you need to ignore Vanguard's reported gains on the confirmations you receive.  Vanguard considers covered and noncovered shares as being in "separate accounts" and computes the average for covered shares independently from the average for noncovered shares.&lt;ref&gt;[https://personal.vanguard.com/jumppage/costbasis/CostBasisMethod.html Cost basis methods available at Vanguard] - Under "Average cost (AvgCost)," select "Learn more."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;See detailed explanation in forum discussion thread: [http://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=1959301#p1959301 1099-B and Vanguard's Cost Basis Amount], direct link to post.&lt;/ref&gt;

There was a double-category method which allowed you to separate short-term and long-term gains, but the IRS eliminated that method on April 1, 2011.

==Choosing a method==
You must tell your custodian (the brokerage or fund company which holds the assets) which accounting method to use.  The brokerage can allow you to use a choice other than the standard choices, such as highest-in-first-out; if you use such a choice, you are effectively using specific identification, but giving a standing order to the brokerage, "Always sell the shares with the highest cost."  (This option usually minimizes taxes, but you may need to override the decision to minimize taxes in some situations; for example, you might have a $2,000 short-term gain on the highest-cost shares and a $3,000 long-term gain on the lowest-cost shares.)  Vanguard's default choice is average basis for mutual funds and FIFO for stocks.  

If you owned mutual funds before Vanguard was required to keep track of the basis, your old shares will be assigned an average basis in Vanguard's records; Vanguard does not allow you to specify a basis in its records, but you can specify it when you sell.  If you owned stocks which were not bought at Vanguard Brokerage (including ETF shares converted from Vanguard funds), you can enter the basis yourself.

==Changing methods==
In 2011, you were required to use the same method for each fund even if the fund is held in multiple accounts.  Starting in 2012, you are allowed to use average basis and other methods for different accounts even in the same fund.  You may also change accounting methods at any time.  Thus, if you made your first sale as FIFO, you may specifically identify another sale as long as you do not sell the shares already sold.  If you change to another method from average-basis, all shares keep their average basis (i.e., they retain the basis computed prior to the change).

You may also choose to use different methods for different funds held in the same account; for example, you might use FIFO or average basis for a bond fund (for which the methods make little difference) and specific identification for a stock fund.

==Cautions==
There are some complications to the computation of basis and some restrictions on taking of losses.  See the links below for more information, and do not treat this wiki page as tax advice.

Suppose that you have a fund in a taxable account, and you have an alternative fund with lower costs or lower taxes.  You would like to switch, but you have capital gains in the old fund, and would need to pay taxes if you switch.  Usually, the long-term advantage of the lower-cost fund will outweigh the short-term cost of switching.  There is a link below to a [[#External links|spreadsheet]] which you can use to estimate the comparison.

If you decide not to switch, or will take some time deciding, do not reinvest any dividends or capital gains in the old fund; you do not want to buy more shares of a fund which is costing you in taxes.  

==Rules of thumb==
If the annual difference in taxes and costs is more than 10% of the tax you would pay, you should almost always switch.  If the difference is less but it is mostly an expense difference, multiply the amount saved per year by the number of years you expect to hold the fund, and if that is equal to, or even close to, the tax cost, then you should come out ahead by switching.  If the difference is less but it is mostly caused by the higher-expense fund having more long-term gains, you'll have to work out the difference more carefully.  

==The potential gains from switching==
While the cost of switching is easy to measure, the potential gains include an indirect gain from a higher tax basis as well as the direct gain from lower costs.  If you keep the old fund, you will still sell it eventually and pay taxes on your capital gains, and thus keeping the fund does not save you the full value of the taxes, as it only delays the payment.  For example, if you sell $20,000 of the old fund with a $10,000 basis and pay $1,500 in tax, you will have a new fund with $18,500 invested and an $18,500 basis.  Thus you will avoid re-paying tax on $8,500 of gains when you sell the new fund.

This explains the 10% rule of thumb.  In the example above, suppose that you hold the new fund for one year and one day (so that the gains are taxed at the long-term rate), the new fund gains 10% after tax, and the old fund gains 9.25% after tax, a difference of 10% of the capital-gains tax cost.  The new fund will be worth $20,350, and if you sell it then, you will pay $278 tax on the $1,850 gain, so your after-tax value is $20,072.  The old fund would be worth $21,850, and if you sold it then, you would pay $1,778 tax on the $11,850 gain, also ending with $20,072.  If the market returns are less than 10%, the new fund is better even after one year.

The higher tax basis is also the reason for the "close" in the second rule of thumb; if the new fund grows to be worth almost as much as the old fund would have been worth, then the tax savings will cause it to come out ahead after you sell.

==Examples==
Here are some examples worked out with the spreadsheet in the [[#Links|Links]] section.

In all of these examples, Fund B returns 8% annually, with 2% in [[Qualified dividend | qualified dividends ]]giving it a 7.7% after-tax return, and your basis in Fund A is half the current value (7.5% tax if you sell).  It is also assumed that the current (2008) tax rates will not change, with long-term gains and qualified dividends taxed at 15%.

If Fund A costs an extra 0.50% over Fund B with the same distributions, for a 7.2% after-tax return, then it takes eight years to break even if you switch, assuming you reinvest all dividends in Fund B if you keep Fund A. 

If Fund A costs an extra 0.50% over Fund B and the extra cost comes out of the [[Qualified dividend | qualified dividend]] yield (giving Fund A a 7.27% after-tax return), then it takes nine years to break even.

If Fund A and Fund B have the same costs but Fund B has 2% distributions with 0.30% in tax (all qualified dividends) while Fund A has 4% distributions with 0.80% in tax (a mixture of short-term and long-term gains in addition to the dividends), then it takes 27 years to break even.  Thus the effective cost is just 0.28%; 0.20% is completely lost because it is the tax difference between short-term and long-term gains, while the other 0.30% of taxes on gains has an effective cost of only 0.08% because the lower turnover of Fund B allows your gains to grow longer before being taxed but does not avoid the tax.

==Clear indications for switching==
This discussion assumes that the only reason you want to switch funds is the cost savings.  If you hold a fund which is no longer appropriate for you (for example, you hold too much stock for your current asset allocation), you should pay the tax cost even if it might represent a net dollar loss.

If the cost for switching is a deferred load (shares in such funds are often called B shares), you should ignore the deferred load when selling, and sell now if that is the only cost.  The reason is that you will have to pay the deferred load whether you sell or not, so you should treat it as money which you have already lost but which has not been deducted on your statement.  For example, a typical B share fund might charge a 5% load which goes away gradually if you hold the fund for six years, but charge a 1% annual 12b(1) fee which, like a load, goes to compensate the broker.  Thus, if you have held the fund for less than one year and sell, you will lose 5% of your investment to the sale; if you hold it until the load goes away, you will lose 5% in the 12b(1) fee by holding the fund five years.  (Vanguard funds do not have such deferred loads; if you are considering switching out of a Vanguard fund which has a [[redemption fee]], or switching into a fund which has a [[purchase fee]], add the fees to any tax cost in your decision whether to switch.)

==Another way to get rid of the fund==
If you have long-term gains in a fund you do not want to keep, you can avoid paying the capital-gains tax entirely by [[Donating appreciated securities|donating it to charity]].  The charity won't owe any tax on the gains, and you can usually get a tax deduction for the full value of the fund.

==Notes==
All of the computations above assume that the only difference in fund performance is based on the known expenses and costs.  While this may be the best estimate you can make, it is subject to the usual disclaimer that past performance is not an indication of future results; if you switch from an actively managed fund to an index fund with 1% lower expenses, you may expect it to underperform the index by 1%, but it could easily outperform by 3% or underperform by 5%.  Even switching between two index funds in the same class may lead to a performance difference other than the expense difference, due to differences in index construction or tracking error of the two funds.

Vanguard offers three '''mutual funds which are explicitly tax-managed'''.  However, [[indexing|index]] funds and [[exchange-traded funds]] (ETFs) are inherently tax-efficient, and are sometimes less expensive; therefore, the tax-managed [[mutual fund]]s may not always be the best options even for taxable investors. 

==General recommendations==

[https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/mutual-funds/profile/vtmsx Vanguard Tax-Managed Small-Cap Fund] is worth holding if your taxable account needs a separate [[small cap]] fund; it is less expensive than the corresponding ETF, and provides stronger small-cap exposure and almost no cost compared to Small-Cap Index.  [https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/mutual-funds/profile/vtclx Vanguard Tax-Managed Capital Appreciation Fund] is no longer worthwhile in most situations; it is about break-even in total cost in the top bracket, and could come out slightly ahead if your marginal tax rate is unusually high because of state taxes or phase-outs in the tax code.  Likewise, Total Stock Market is better than a combination of the two tax-managed funds; it is about break-even in the top bracket and slightly ahead at an unusually high rate.

[https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/mutual-funds/profile/vtmfx Vanguard Tax-Managed Balanced Fund] has no tax advantage over the individual funds, just the simplicity; it has slightly lower expenses if your investment is less than $100,000.  Even that benefit may be lost because of extra tax costs if you need to sell the fund to change your bond allocation.

Vanguard also used to have a Tax-Managed International Fund; it merged with the Developed Markets Index fund in 2014.  If you previously had TM International, you should keep these shares rather than selling for a capital gain because the additional cost is trivial.  The core of a taxable international portfolio could either be 80% Developed Markets and 20% Emerging Markets Index, or 100% Total International.

==Comparisons==

{{Notice|All of these calculations depend on assumptions about [[tax basics|taxes]] and [[dividend]]s, and may not represent the actual taxes or dividends of any fund.  (Dividend yields are based on SEC yields as of June 12, 2023.) Consult your tax advisor for tax advice.}}

These comparisons are based on the total costs, including both taxes and expenses.  Calculations will be done with three tax assumptions: 12%/24%/top tax brackets. In the 12% tax bracket, [[qualified dividend]]s and long-term gains are taxed at 0%. In the 24% tax bracket, qualified dividends and long-term gains are taxed at 15%. In the top tax bracket, investment income is taxed at 40.8% (including the 3.8% Affordable Care Act surcharge) and qualified dividends and long-term gains are taxed at 23.8% (including the surcharge).

Your actual tax cost will be higher if you owe state taxes (add your state tax rate on the dividend yield, reduced by your federal tax rate if you itemize deductions and are not over the limit for deducting state taxes) or are in the phase-out range for some tax benefit such as the child tax credit (add 5% to all tax rates) or the personal exemption phase-out for the Alternative Minimum Tax (add 7% to all tax rates, but your overall tax on non-qualified dividends is 28% plus that 7%).

===Tax-Managed Small-Cap===
TM Small-Cap tracks the same index as the S&amp;P 600 ETF, with 0.01% lower expenses, and a comparable yield.  Neither fund is likely to distribute a capital gain. The advantage of TM Small-Cap is from more qualified dividends, but the difference has decreased since 2020, only 5-7% more than for the S&amp;P 600 ETF and 2-3% more than Small-Cap Index.  The table reports the 2018-2022 averages.

If you do not use ETFs, Small-Cap Index has an expense ratio 0.03% less than TM Small-Cap, and could give a slightly lower tax cost, but a higher cap range, so you need more of Small-Cap Index to get the same small-cap exposure.

| 0.06% || 1.65% || 79% || 0.10% || 0.33% || 0.51%
|-
|}

===Tax-Managed Capital Appreciation===
TM Capital Appreciation tracks the Russell 1000 index, with 0.03% lower expenses than the ETF but a lower yield because it selects stocks to reduce dividend yields. 

Large-Cap Index is an alternative fund, and the alternative you would use if you do not use ETFs. It is a similar index with 0.03% lower expenses.  500 Index misses most of the mid-caps, but if you don't need mid-caps, it is a comparable alternative.  At a 23.8% marginal tax rate, the tax savings from TM Capital Appreciation do not cover the cost difference, but adding about another 10% in state tax and in phase-outs in federal tax would cause TM Capital Appreciation to have the lowest total cost.

All of these index funds should have close to 100% qualified dividends; the reported numbers are the 2018-2022 averages.

|}

===Tax-managed funds versus Total Stock Market===

90% TM Capital Appreciation and 10% TM Small-Cap approximates the allocation of Total Stock Market.  However, Total Stock Market saves 0.05% in expenses, has almost 100% qualified dividends, should never distribute a capital gain, and eliminates your own potential capital gains from rebalancing the large-cap and small-cap funds.  Total Stock Market thus comes out ahead of the TM combination, even in the top bracket, unless your marginal tax rate on qualified dividends is well above 23.8%; it also avoids the need to realize your own capital gains if you rebalance between large-cap and small-cap funds.

{| class="wikitable sortable" style="margin: 1em auto 1em auto; text-align:center"
|-
! Fund !! Expense !! Dividends !! Qualified !! Cost in 12% bracket || Cost in 24% bracket !! Cost in top bracket

| 0.09% || 1.40% ||  99% || 0.09% || 0.29% || 0.43%
|-
! Total Stock Market
| 0.04% || 1.55% ||  95% || 0.05% || 0.26% || 0.42%
|-
|}

===Tax-Managed Balanced===
TM Balanced is essentially the same as 49% TM Capital Appreciation and 51% Intermediate-Term Tax-Exempt.  The expenses are 0.09% for both the balanced fund and the two individual funds (assuming Admiral shares of the municipal-bond fund with a $50,000 minimum; the expense difference is 0.05% if you have Investor shares).   However, it isn't really suitable for a single-fund portfolio because it lacks international stocks.  In addition, it has the usual disadvantage of a balanced fund in a taxable account: you cannot sell bonds without paying a capital gain on your stock sales.  In particular, if you move to a high-tax state, you may want to sell your national municipal-bond fund and buy a fund for that state, but you will have to pay a capital-gains tax if your municipal bonds are in a balanced fund.

===Total international===

To get the same allocation as Total International, you need 80% Developed Markets (nee TM International), and 20% Emerging Markets.  Developed Markets and Emerging Markets started to include small-caps in 2015, so there is no longer a need for the FTSE All-World Ex-US Small-Cap fund unless you want to overweight small-caps.  The two-fund combination has 0.08% expenses, compared to 0.11% for Total International; both are 0.07% expenses for ETFs.  If there is a cost advantage, you would not lose it to rebalancing costs, because Total International does not effectively rebalance to the 80/20 ratio; if emerging markets become 25% of the total international market, either Total International or an unrebalanced two-fund combination will be 25% emerging.

These funds are not a perfect match, as Emerging Markets Index includes China A-Shares, which causes it to have a larger weight in China than the emerging portion of Total International.

{{Notice |This page was created prior to the 2018 TCJA tax law. The examples below use tax rates applicable in 2017.}}

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a way to improve the after-tax return of your taxable investments.

One advantage of taxable accounts is that you can use losses that inevitably occur in some years to lower your tax bill. This is called tax loss harvesting. There are three benefits.

First, tax losses are effectively an interest-free loan which defers capital gains taxes you would otherwise owe into the distant future, and can even eliminate them entirely when you die.

Second, after offsetting realized gains, you can use any remaining tax losses to deduct $3,000 from your ordinary income each year. This can mean an extra $750 or more in your pocket if you are in the 25 percent federal tax bracket.

Third, you can roll over any remaining losses into later years, so that you can defer your capital gains and deduct up to $3,000 from your income, each year until you have used up your losses.

== Overview ==
Suppose that you had invested $10,000 into a [[mutual fund]] in a taxable account, but after a steep decline your holdings are now worth only $6,000. Because you plan to continue holding that fund, you might consider ignoring the losses and waiting for the fund to eventually recover.

Instead, using tax loss harvesting, you would sell the fund, and then buy it back [[Wash sale|31 days later]]. In the meantime, you can either hold the cash in a [[Money markets|money market]] fund, or invest it in a similar but not substantially identical fund. This realizes a $4,000 capital loss, but putting you back in your original position 31 days later.

This $4,000 capital loss is valuable in several ways.

Before you pay any capital gains taxes each year, you must use your capital losses to offset any capital gains, and pay taxes only if you have more gains than losses. Short term losses first offset short term gains and long term losses first offset long term gains. If there are any losses left, short term losses offset remaining long term gains or long term losses offset remaining short term gains. If there are any losses left, you must apply up to $3,000 of your remaining capital losses against your regular income. And whatever capital losses are still left over (in this case, $1,000, which is the $4,000 in losses minus the $3,000 deduction) you must carry forward indefinitely into future years.

Each year, you must first apply the carried forward losses against capital gains, and then use any remainder (up to $3,000) to reduce your ordinary income.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Tax loss carryover to the following year is mandatory. See this {{Forum link | t= 318312 | title = If you TLH, do you have to apply it that tax year? | author = geospatial | date = June 22, 2020 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Using tax loss harvesting to offset capital gains does not eliminate the capital gains taxes you would have paid. Instead, it defers those taxes into the future. In this example, you will owe more capital gains taxes in the future because you bought back the fund at a cost basis that is $4,000 lower.

However, because future money is worth less than money today, there is a saying in public finance that "a tax deferred is a tax avoided". Using tax loss harvesting to defer capital gains taxes is like receiving an interest-free loan from the IRS.

Also, if you (and your spouse) are still holding the shares when you die, your heirs will receive a stepped-up basis, and you will have had the up-front benefit from tax loss harvesting while avoiding the taxes on the back end entirely.

Finally, the extra capital gains you owe in the (possibly distant) future will be at the (lower) capital gains rate, while the benefit you receive today of the $3,000 deduction is at your (higher) marginal income tax rate.

==How it works==

Tax loss harvesting works in several different ways. Some examples are shown below.

===Investing a single sum===

* '''January 2008:''' You invest $10,000 in Total Stock Market.
* '''February 2008:''' The balance drops to $9,000. You sell it.
* '''March 2008:''' You put $9,000 back into Total Stock Market. (Suppose that the share price is the same as in February, 2008 for simplicity.)
* '''February 2009:''' You do your 2008 tax return. Because you have lost $1,000, you can reduce your ordinary income by $1,000, assuming you do not have any capital gains. If you are in the 25% bracket for example, you reduce your tax liability by $250. So, you invest the saving, $250, in Total Stock Market.

Suppose Total Stock Market keeps growing 8% year for 10 years after February, 2008.

* '''January 2018:''' $10,000, which dropped to $9,000 in 2008, becomes $19,430.32 (= $9,000 * 1.08^10). $250 becomes $499.75 (= 250 * 1.08^9). Both of these combined, you have $19,930.07. You sell all shares and pay 15% tax on long-term capital gains. You end up with:

 $9,000+($19,430.32-$9,000)*85%+$250+($499.75-$250)*85% = $18,328.05

What if you did not sell Total Stock Market in February, 2008? Note that you do not get $250 back in your 2008 tax return in 2009, so you end up with:

 $10,000+($19,430.32-$10,000)*85% = $18,015.77

Notice the $312.29 difference. This is what you get by investing $250 doing a tax loss harvesting. Obviously, the longer you hold shares you purchased with the $250 refund, the more benefit you get.

In this example, you got two types of benefits; you paid less in total tax, and the tax which you did owe was paid much later. When you deducted the $1,000 loss at a 25% rate, you created an additional $1,000 in capital gains to be taxed when you sold later (2018 in this example), but only at 15%. Essentially, the IRS paid you $100 of free money, and gave you an interest-free loan of another $150 in 2009 to be paid back only when you sold the stock. You benefited both from investing the $100 for its full value, and from the interest-free loan which allowed you to invest the $150 for ten years and pay back only the original $150.

In reality, things are a bit more complicated. In the above example, we completely ignored dividends from Total Stock Market. Also, the share price may change between February 2008 and March 2008.

===Using a loss from one tax lot to offset the capital gains from another===

Suppose the following:

* '''January 2008:''' You invest $1,000,000 in Total Stock Market.
* '''February 2008:''' You tax loss harvest after losing $100,000.
* '''January 2010:''' You invest additional $50,000 in Total Stock Market.
* '''January 2011:''' You retire. You sell the shares purchased in January 2010, which has grown to $60,000.

In 2011, you have not used up the loss realized in February 2008 as you can only deduct $3,000/year, so you can use a part of the remaining loss to offset the capital gain realized in January 2011.

If $60,000 is enough for your living expenses, you may have little or no taxable income because the gain is offset by the realized loss carryforward, and the return of capital, $50,000, is tax free. If this is the case, you might consider [http://www.fairmark.com/rothira/post.htm Post-Retirement Roth Conversion] to take advantage of the standard/itemized deduction and low tax brackets.

===Donating low basis shares to a charity===

Suppose the following:

* '''January 2008:''' You invest $10,000 in Total Stock Market.
* '''February 2008:''' You tax loss harvest after losing $1,000.
* '''March 2008:''' You reinvest $9,000 in Total Stock Market.
* '''January 2009 and on:''' You make many purchases of shares of Total Stock Market.
* '''January 2020:''' You donate the shares purchased in March 2008 to a charity.

If you donate the shares purchased in March 2008 to a charity, you do not have to pay tax on the capital gains. That is, you keep the full tax savings in 2008 and never "pay back" the savings to the IRS. See [[Donating appreciated securities]] for more details.

===Stepped up cost basis upon death===
{{Main |Step-up in basis}}

Suppose the following:

* '''January 2008:''' You invest $10,000 in Total Stock Market.
* '''February 2008:''' You tax loss harvest after losing $1,000.
* '''March 2008:''' You reinvest $9,000 in Total Stock Market.
* '''January 2009 and on:''' You make many purchases of shares of Total Stock Market.
* '''January 2020:''' You retire and start withdrawing from your taxable account, highest cost basis first.

Perhaps do not sell shares purchased in your life time, in which case, the shares purchased in March 2008 receive stepped up cost basis upon your death. That is, you keep the full tax savings in 2008 and never "pay back" the savings to the IRS.

==What if the tax rates go up in the future?==

Some people speculate that the tax rates may go up in the future. Tax loss harvesting still works as long as the increase is reasonable. Specifically, you benefit from tax loss harvesting as long as the tax you pay on the $1,000 extra capital gains ($10,000 - $9,000) in the first example above is less than the after-tax amount that $250 grows to.

Suppose the long-term capital gain tax rate goes up to 30%. Then you would pay $300 on the $1,000 extra capital gains. However, $250 grows to $499.75 with the after-tax amount being $424.83, so you are not losing money yet.

==Fine points about tax loss harvesting==

===Regulatory===

* '''[[Wash sale]]'''. If you sell Total Stock Market for a loss, while still holding other shares of the same fund purchased within the past 30 days, or purchase shares of the same fund within 30 days after the sale, that would be called a wash sale, and you cannot claim the losses on your tax return. The definition of a wash sale is a bit more complicated than that. Before you tax loss harvest, be sure to familiarize yourself with the [http://www.fairmark.com/capgain/wash/ wash sale rule].
* '''[[Qualified dividend|Qualified dividends]]'''. If you hold shares for fewer than 61 days and receive qualified dividends from those shares, you cannot take them as qualified dividends, even though the fund company may state that they are qualified. Receiving dividends that are not qualified may outweigh the benefit of tax loss harvesting.
* '''Loss on mutual fund shares held 6 months or less'''. If you sell shares of a mutual fund at a loss, and you have held those shares for 6 months or less, special rules may alter the loss you claim. First, if those shares produced any tax-exempt interest, your loss is reduced, dollar for dollar, by that interest. Second, if you held those shares while the fund distributed (long term) capital gains, you have to treat this loss as a long term loss up to the dollar amount of the distribution those shares produced.&lt;ref name="pub550"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/publications/p550| title=Publication 550, Investment Income and Expenses| publisher=IRS| accessdate=August 29, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{forum link| t=173117| title=Corrections for the wiki article on TLH| date=September 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vanguard (and probably most other brokerages) will not adjust your IRS Form 1099-B, so you will have to correct it yourself by filing Form 8949 and changing the type of capital loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{forum link| t=273200| title=TLH holding period not met for LTCG distributions; how to report?| date=February 17, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:Most Vanguard Tax Exempt funds (and others like them) avoid this six-month rule because of the way they accrue and pay out interest (dividends).{{#tag:ref|The six-month rule for tax exempt interest comes from 26 U.S. Code § 852(b)(4)(B), but there is an exception in 852(b)(4)(E) for funds that declare dividends daily and pay them monthly or more frequently.&lt;ref&gt;{{forum link| p=2634098| title=Re: Yield on Vanguard Int. Term Tax Exempt Fund| date=September 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/852| title=26 U.S. Code § 852 - Taxation of regulated investment companies and their shareholders| publisher=Legal Information Institute| accessdate=August 29, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=note}}
:However, [[Exchange-traded funds | ETF]]s and the [{{Vf|vteax}} Tax-Exempt Bond Index Fund] (which is the mutual fund class of an ETF) ''are'' subject to the six-month rule, because they declare dividends monthly, not daily. To see whether a fund is exempt from the six-month rule, check its prospectus for "dividends are declared daily and paid monthly". If it says "dividends are declared monthly" (or quarterly), the six-month rule applies.
*'''Death of taxpayer'''. Capital losses cannot be carried over after a taxpayer's death. You deduct them only on the final income tax return filed on the decedent's behalf.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/publications/p544| title=Publication 544 (2022), Sales and Other Dispositions of Assets| publisher=IRS| accessdate=August 29, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Operational===

* '''Reinvesting dividends and capital gains'''. If you automatically reinvest dividends and capital gains, you may accidentally trigger a [[wash sale]]. If you plan to tax loss harvest, it is generally safer to take dividends and capital gain distributions in cash.
* '''Cost basis accounting'''. Use [[Specific identification of shares]] instead of average cost basis to sell shares with losses.
* '''Put volatile investments in your taxable account'''. For example, an international fund is more volatile because of political and currency risks. This makes it more likely you will be able to tax loss harvest.
* '''Commissions and [[bid/ask spread]]s'''. If you are tax loss harvesting ETFs or individual stocks, you may have to pay commissions and bid/ask spreads, and these erode the tax loss harvesting benefits. Compare the amount of tax you save to trading costs, and tax loss harvest only when the trading costs are minimal compared to your tax saving.
* '''Mutual funds'''. You do not face commissions or bid-ask spreads. However, some mutual funds have [[Redemption fee | redemptions fees]] for a certain period after the purchase. Another problem is that you could try to realize a small loss in a mutual fund position, but the loss may disappear by the time the redemption completes. Consider tax loss harvesting on a sizable loss that is unlikely to disappear in one day.
* '''Frequent-trading restrictions'''. Vanguard does not allow you to sell most funds and buy back into the same fund electronically within 30 days.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;There are some exceptions. For details, see [https://investor.vanguard.com/investor-resources-education/online-trading/trading-violations-penalties Trading violations and penalties] from Vanguard.&lt;/ref&gt; If you plan to buy the fund back within 31 days, do one of the two transactions by mail.
* '''Investment volatility'''. If you wait 31 days to reinvest you will usually see volatility in the investment. If the price of the investment goes up while you are in cash you lose, but if it goes down you gain. You might expect that over a long period of tax harvesting these volatility effects might wash out (if random) or perhaps, if there is a short term momentum effect, a slight advantage to tax loss harvesting over the long haul. You can however mitigate this if you immediately purchase a similar, but not substantially identical investment. However doing this makes your investing more complicated, especially if you are swapping fractional lots of the original fund.

==Should I tax loss harvest before or after a distribution?==
The general rule is to sell before and buy after a [[dividend]] and [[capital gains distribution]].
More important is to buy after the distribution; if you sell Fund A to buy Fund B, you want to wait until after Fund B makes a large distribution, even if you receive a distribution from Fund A.

The reason is that you pay tax on any distribution, but every dollar of distribution reduces the fund's NAV by one dollar, so you get a tax benefit from this dollar as a capital loss (or reduced gain) if you sell. When you are selling Fund A to tax loss harvest, you will always get the capital loss. If you buy Fund B, you do not get any benefit from the capital loss until you sell. Even if you intend to switch back immediately, if Fund B pays a [[qualified dividend]], you need to hold Fund B for 61 days rather than 31 or else the dividend loses its qualified status, and waiting 61 days increases the potential cost of switching back.

You usually want to tax loss harvest before a distribution as long as you need not buy the replacement fund before its distribution, but it depends on the type of distribution.

If the distribution is a capital-gains distribution, then it is exactly canceled by the capital loss, so there is no net tax effect. If the distribution is an [[ordinary dividend]] then it has increased taxes at the marginal tax rate, and the capital loss is likely to give less in tax savings. If the distribution is a qualified dividend and the capital loss offsets long-term gains, this is break-even because the qualified dividend and reduced capital gain are taxed at the same rate. If the distribution is a qualified dividend and the capital loss offsets short-term gains or ordinary income, there is a benefit for waiting. And if the distribution is a mostly qualified dividend with [[foreign tax credit]], you may pay tax at less than the long-term gains rate, and should wait for the distribution before harvesting the loss.

==When not to harvest losses==
When you sell at a loss you will either offset capital gains which would have otherwise been taxed at your capital gains rate or you will offset income (up to $3,000 maximum per year) which would have otherwise been taxed at your marginal income tax rate, or both.

If you offset capital gains that would have otherwise not been taxed at all (because your capital gains tax rate is 0%) then this part of the tax loss harvest may be an outright loss. Here is why:

You can think of tax loss harvesting as a loan from the IRS in the following sense. If you reinvest the funds from the the sale in the same or similar securities (after waiting 31 days if necessary to avoid a wash sale), then the transactions give you a lower basis. Ultimately, if the asset price of that security increases you will pay taxes on capital gains when you sell. As a result, the tax loss harvesting tax benefit may ultimately result in a higher capital gains tax rate in a future year than you might have otherwise faced. So, if tax loss harvesting offsets capital gains that would have been taxed at 0% but your future capital gains rate is not 0% then it has created a loss. Put simply, you get no benefit from offsetting capital gains that are not taxed anyway.

Bottom line: know your tax rates before you tax loss harvest.

==What if the stock is worthless?==
If a company fails, the IRS imposes different rules.&lt;ref name="pub550" /&gt;

Stocks, stock rights, and bonds (other than those held for sale by a securities dealer) that became completely worthless during the tax year are treated as though they were sold on the last day of the tax year. This affects whether your capital loss is long term or short term.

Report worthless securities on IRS [https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-8949 Form 8949], Part I or Part II, whichever applies. You may need to file an amended return to report a stock which became worthless in a prior year.&lt;ref&gt;{{forum link| p=2058878| title=Re: How to Recognize Capital Loss| date=May 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If you are holding your employer's [[stock basics|stock]] in your employer provided  [[Qualified retirement plan|qualified plan]], '''{{PAGENAME}}''' uses a special favorable section of the tax law that allows you to to pay capital gains tax rates on the stock if you are separating from service with your employer, the plan is distributed in a lump sum, and the stock was purchased by your contributions and employer matches.

==Net unrealised appreciation==
The Net unrealised appreciation (NUA) of the stock is not taxed when distributed, and is taxed at capital gains tax rates when sold. Only the taxable cost basis of the stock is recognized as a taxable distribution.

{| class="wikitable" width="100%"
|
&lt;u&gt;Example&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Chris is set to retire from his job with Coca-Cola,Inc. His 401(k) contains $1.1 million dollars of Coca-Cola stock. The 401(k) administrator informs Chris that he has a basis of $300,000 in the stock and $800,000 of NUA. Instead of rolling the 401(k) over into an IRA, Chris elects to take out the stock under the NUA tax rules. The $300,000 basis is deemed a distribution from the 401(k) and is subject to income tax, and if Chris is less than 55, a 10% early withdrawal penalty tax. The $800,000 NUA is not taxed upon distribution. If Chris sells the stock upon distribution, it will be taxed as a long term capital gain. If Chris holds on to the stock, he can defer tax until he sells. Any further realized short term gain on the stock will be taxed as a short term capital gain; any further realized gain held for more than a year is taxed as a long term gain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Natalie Choate| title=Life and Death Planning for Retirement Benefits| edition=6th| date=2006| isbn=978-0-9649440-7-7| pp=138-139| ref={{SfnRef|Choate|2006}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|}

Note that it is the employer or the plan that determines the basis and NUA.

Beneficiaries of a retirement plan can also take advantage of the NUA rules. The IRS considers this to be [[Income in respect of a decedent|income in respect of a decedent]] (IRD). The NUA is taxed at capital gains tax rates when sold, and the beneficiaries get to take a deduction on any estate tax attributable to the NUA.

If the NUA is distributed and held until death, the beneficiaries do not receive step up valuation of the NUA (it still retains its character as NUA and becomes [[Income in respect of a decedent| income in respect of a decedent]] taxed as a long term capital gain). Any appreciation in the stock beyond the NUA does qualify for stepped up valuation.

Qualified plan participants often hold a mixture of company stock and other investments. In this instance, the lump sum distribution would rollover the non NUA assets and not rollover the NUA.

&lt;u&gt;Example&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Mary takes a lump sum distribution from her company 401(k) plan. Her $450,000 plan balance includes $80,000 of her employer's stock. The balance of her assets are in mutual funds. Her plan informs her that she has a basis of $30,000 in the stock. Mary rolls over (in a trustee-to-trustee transfer) the $370,000 of mutual fund investments and takes a distribution of the stock. She will pay income tax (and any applicable early withdrawal penalty taxes) on the $30,000 basis. Her $50,000 NUA will be taxed at capital gains tax rates when sold.{{sfn|Choate|2006|pp=143-144}}
|}

When taking a distribution of NUA stock, it is advisable to not commingle the NUA stock with employer stock already held in a taxable account. You should set up a separate account for holding the NUA stock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.investopedia.com/investing/rolling-over-company-stock/| title=Rolling Over Company Stock from a 401(k): When It Does—and Doesn't—Make Sense| publisher=Investopedia| date=January 16, 2023| accessdate=May 14, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The decision as to whether to rollover employer stock or take the NUA distribution is a quantifiable decision. In general, a young employee changing jobs and having a small NUA would likely decide to roll the stock over to a rollover [[IRA rollovers and transfers|IRA]], whereas a 70 year old retiree facing imminent [[Required Minimum Distribution vs annuitization|Required Minimum Distribution]]  would likely take the NUA distribution. Obviously, if the amount of NUA in a plan is large, taking the NUA distribution would be appealing.

The following advanced considerations concerning NUA require the aid of a professional retirement plan specialist:
* Rolling over the employer's basis in the plan and taking distribution of only the NUA.
* Contributing the NUA distribution to a Charitable Remainder Trust (private letter IRS authorization will be necessary.{{sfn|Choate|2006|pp=138-145}}

One of the most frequently asked questions on the forum is whether to '''reinvest dividends in a ''taxable account.''''' This article discusses the pros and cons of taking dividends in cash in the taxable account. Below, the term "dividends" is used for brevity, but it should be understood as "dividend and capital gain distributions" to be precise.

==Pros of taking dividends in cash==

It is a good idea to take dividends in cash in several cases:

* If you are planning to use [[Specific Identification of Shares | specific identification of shares]], taking dividends in cash avoids creating a lot of small tax lots. You can invest dividends along with new money.
* If you are planning to [[Tax loss harvesting | tax loss harvest]], automatically reinvesting dividends may accidentally trigger a [[wash sale]].
* If you are investing a relatively small amount of new money compared to the dividends you receive, taking dividends in cash may make rebalancing easier, because you can choose not to put any new money (including dividends) into an outperforming fund.
* If you have difficulty maxing out tax-advantaged accounts from your paycheck, and taking dividends from your taxable account would allow you to max out your tax-advantaged accounts, you may want to take dividends in cash and use the cash to max out your tax-advantaged accounts. (This situation may apply if you have inherited a large taxable account, or have built a large taxable account after ignoring the benefits of tax-advantaged accounts for many years.)
* If your taxable account has a fund that is less than ideal but remains a suitable holding, you might want to take dividends in cash from that fund. For example, if you have Vanguard 500 Index Fund with a large amount of unrealized capital gains, and your asset allocation calls for Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund for domestic stocks, you may want to take dividends from Vanguard 500 Index Fund in cash to avoid investing more money into Vanguard 500 Index Fund.
* If you are retired and drawing income from taxable accounts, taking dividends and capital gains distributions in cash simplifies your tax accounting.{{#tag:ref|Vanguard lists the following common sources of retirement income:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://c.ymcdn.com/sites/www.planningforafuture.com/resource/resmgr/docs/spending_from_a_portfolio.pdf| title= Spending from a Portfolio: Implications of Withdrawal Order on Taxable Investor| author1=Colleen M.

*Social security
*Pensions
*Part-time employment
*Trust income
*Rental income
*Required minimum distributions
*Dividend, interest, and capital gains from taxable accounts

If these sources of income are more than enough for your needs, you can take income distributions from the taxable account in cash and reinvest in your taxable portfolio, just as you might do during the accumulation stage. If these income sources do not provide you with enough income, consider additional sales from the taxable account.|group="note"}}

==Cons of taking dividends in cash==

Although taking dividends and capital gain in cash generally simplifies cost basis accounting, there are several caveats.

* If you have your mutual fund or brokerage automatically reinvest distributions back into a fund with a purchase fee, shares purchased with the distributions are not subject to the purchase fee (at Vanguard, the Vanguard Global Ex-US Real Estate Index Fund imposes a purchase fee). However, the savings with automatic reinvestment are extremely small. If you assume 2% distributions from a fund with a 0.75% [[purchase fee]], the purchase fee is 0.02% of the fund balance.
* If you have your mutual fund or brokerage automatically reinvest distributions back into a fund with a permanent redemption fee (such as, for example, the Vanguard Global Ex-US Real Estate Index Fund), shares purchased with distributions are subject to the fee. However, if the fund imposes a short-term [[redemption fee]], shares purchased with distributions are usually not subject to a redemption fee if you redeem them within the short-term redemption fee period. This feature is specific to a fund.
* There is a small opportunity cost for not investing dividends immediately. See [[Delaying reinvestment of dividends]] for more details.

==Observations==
* There is no extra tax cost for reinvesting dividends, compared to receiving cash and buying shares. Either way, the newly-added shares have a basis which you subtract from the sale price of those shares to compute the capital gain when you sell.
* Taking dividends in cash does not require you to use [[Specific Identification of Shares | specific identification of shares]] or do [[Tax loss harvesting | tax loss harvesting]].
* If you are planning to use average cost basis, the reinvested shares will have the same average basis as all previous shares. If your next transaction in the fund is to sell shares, you will probably have a taxable capital gain, which you could have avoiding by taking the dividend in cash. Therefore, you will have an extra tax cost if you reinvest the dividend when you are likely to need to sell shares, either to spend money or to rebalance out of the fund.
* The share price in a bond fund does not vary significantly, so there is little potential tax cost to reinvesting dividends and selling those shares later. (However, because most bond funds distribute dividends monthly, you will always have a [[wash sale]] if you sell any shares for a capital loss, which is an accounting complication even if it does not cost you a significant amount in taxes.)

{{Warning|Adjusting your asset allocation based on taxation may have significant unintended consequences. Tax rates change, tax brackets change, or your tax preferences may change. What was a logical tax location one year may turn out to be a poor choice a few years later. Consider the implications carefully.}}

If you have accounts with different tax treatment (taxable, [[IRA | traditional IRA]] or [[401(k)]], [[Roth IRA]] or 401(k)), equal dollar amounts in those accounts have different after-tax values.  Therefore, if you want to optimize the after-tax value of your portfolio, you should base your [[asset allocation]] on the after-tax value of the accounts.

==Why to adjust==
The purpose of asset allocation is to design a portfolio with the desired level of expected [[Risk and return: an introduction|return and risk]].  Returns and mathematical definitions of risk should be based on after-tax values, since the after-tax value is what you will be able to spend.  Emotional definitions of risk should be based on how you perceive the risk.

===Returns===
The goal of returns is to get the money you will spend to achieve your goal.  If you have $100K in stock in a Roth and the stock market doubles in value, you have $100K more to spend in retirement.  If you have $100K in stock in a traditional IRA, you have $100K more pre-tax but will lose some of the value to taxes upon withdrawal.  If you have $100K in stock in a taxable account, the account will be worth less than $200K after the stock market doubles in value, because of taxes on dividends, and you will have even less to spend because you will pay tax on your capital gains.

===Mathematical risk===
Mathematical risk is based on your need and ability to take risk.  Your need to take risk is determined by the returns you require; if you need your portfolio to double in order to provide an adequate standard of living, you actually need it to double in after-tax value.  Your ability to take risk is determined by the consequences of losses; losing $100K in your Roth IRA will reduce your standard of living (or require more additional savings to keep the same standard) by more than losing $100K in your traditional IRA or taxable account does.

===Emotional risk===
Emotional risk is determined by how you will react to losses.  If you pull out of the stock market after it falls, or you cannot sleep during a bear market, then your portfolio is too risky.  In theory, the best way to handle emotional risk is the same as any other risk; if your portfolio software is set up to only present the after-tax value of your portfolio, then a $100K loss in an account taxed at 24% is only a $76K decrease in your bottom line.  In practice, most investors will not be able to make these adjustments, particularly because the investment statements show dollar values.

==How much to adjust==
There are two reasonable formulas for adjustment, based on the marginal and overall tax rates.  The marginal rate is the correct rate to use for considering changes in the asset allocation (and thus for most tax-adjusted asset allocation), while the overall rate is correct for estimating the portfolio value or expected returns.

===Adjusting by the marginal rate=== 
You should value your Roth at its full value, and reduce the value of your traditional IRA or 401(k) by your expected tax bracket at retirement (including state taxes if your state taxes these withdrawals, which varies by state).  You should also reduce the value of your taxable account by a smaller percent, to account for future capital gains and dividend taxes; estimated values are necessary because the tax cost depends on how much you will have in actual capital gains.

If all of your IRA or 401(k) withdrawals will be in a 24% marginal rate when you retire, then 24% of your withdrawals from a traditional IRA or 401(k) will be lost to taxes.  Therefore, it makes sense to assume that the IRS owns 24% of the account; whatever the gain or loss in nominal dollars, 76% will go to you and 24% to the IRS.  In contrast, the IRS owns none of your Roth, which is tax-free.

If your IRA or 401(k) is large enough that the withdrawals will span multiple tax brackets each year, the marginal tax rate is the rate which affects the risk and return of any marginal decisions you might make, such as a change in your asset allocation.  For example, if you expect that half your withdrawals will be taxed at 12% and half at 22%, you will lose only 17% of the total to taxes.  However, if you increase the risk of your IRA investments and earn an extra $1,000, you will pay an extra $220 in taxes, not $170; if the risk works out badly and you lose $1,000, you will pay $220 less in taxes.  Thus, in this situation, the IRS owns 22% of the part of the IRA in which your decision will make a difference.

The IRS also owns part of your taxable account, representing the difference between what you earn on it and what you could have earned in a tax-free account.  If your taxable account is invested in stocks, you will lose some money every year you hold it to the tax on the dividends, and more to the capital gains tax when you sell.  If it is invested in municipal bonds, you effectively lose the difference between yields on municipal bonds and corporate bonds of comparable risk every year.  The calculation is more complicated (and depends on assumptions about future returns and tax rates), but the adjustment usually comes out about the same for a taxable account and an IRA; [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1E28C1YTb1jzi3hSKK3ABGvWgTmjSlO5W/edit?usp=sharing&amp;ouid=103809420707053067543&amp;rtpof=true&amp;sd=true this spreadsheet] can make an estimated calculation.  The spreadsheet calculates the marginal tax rate, for the same reason as above.

===Adjusting for the overall tax rate===
The overall tax rate, averaged over all your withdrawals, determines the actual after-tax value of your accounts, and thus affects the after-tax returns.  A 401(k) or traditional IRA loses less to tax adjustment from the overall tax rate; a taxable account loses about the same amount because its taxes are at a mostly-flat rate on capital gains and qualified dividends.

A natural assumption for the overall tax rate is that you will have some taxable income independent of your retirement accounts (such as 85% of [[Social Security]], which is taxable for higher-income retirees), and your IRA or 401(k) will be taxed on top of that.  Estimate your other income and deductions, and then compute the tax on the difference between that income and the retirement accounts.  This will be somewhat less than your marginal tax rate if your IRA or 401(k) spans multiple brackets.

If you have a taxable account, you will probably still need to adjust based on your marginal tax rate, because the tax on qualified dividends and long-term gains is effectively a flat 15% (plus state tax) in most tax brackets.  If your total taxable income in retirement is in a 15% tax bracket, you will not owe any federal tax on qualified dividends and capital gains in retirement.  If you hold munis, the tax cost is unaffected by your retirement tax bracket, since it is an effective cost equal to the difference between taxable and tax-exempt bonds of comparable risk.

==Why to make these adjustments==
It is easiest to see why the adjustment is necessary by comparing traditional and Roth accounts.  For example, suppose you have $4,000 in a 401(k) and $3,000 in a Roth IRA, and you will be in a hypothetical (for simplicity) 25% marginal rate when you retire.  You might choose to invest the entire 401(k) in stock and the entire Roth in bonds.  If you do this, and the stock market gains 10% while the bond market gains 5%, your 401(k) would be worth $4,400, and your Roth would be worth $3,150.  The IRS will take 25% of your 401(k) when you withdraw it, so you could now withdraw your investments for $6,450.  Similarly, if you invested the 401(k) in bonds and the Roth in stock, your 401(k) would be worth $4,200, and your Roth would be worth $3,300.  After taxes, you would have the same $6,450.  Since both portfolios give you the same 7.5% return that you would expect from a portfolio which was 50% stock and 50% bonds, it is reasonable to treat both portfolios as having a 50/50 asset allocation, rather than the 57/43 and 43/57 which would result from the nominal values.

The tax adjustment also adjusts for the effective difference in risk between the two accounts.  In the example above, suppose that the stock market loses half its value.  If your 401(k) was entirely in stock, it would drop from $4,000 to $2,000, which would cost you $1,500 in after-tax value; if your Roth was entirely in stock, it would drop from $3,000 to $1,500.  Either way, you lose 25% of the value of your portfolio, so your portfolio has the risk of a portfolio which is 50% stock.

==Consequences==
===Asset location===
Once you adjust for the after-tax value, it does not matter which assets you put in a traditional IRA or 401(k) and which you put in a Roth.  If you are in a hypothetical 25% marginal tax rate range, investing $4,000 in the 401(k) or $3,000 in the Roth in the same investment will give you the same after-tax value.

If all else is equal (and it often isn't because of limited 401(k) options), it is slightly better to put assets with higher expected returns in the Roth.  If your traditional account has lower than expected returns and you fall into a lower tax bracket, the IRS will not give back the same share of the losses; if your traditional account has higher than expected returns, the IRS will take a larger share of the gains.  In the Roth, you get the same percentage (100%) of all gains and losses.  In addition, the Roth is protected against potential changes in tax rates, has more flexible rules for [[Required Minimum Distribution vs annuitization | required minimum distributions]], and is not counted as income for making Social Security taxable.

It still does matter which assets you put in your taxable accounts; see [[Tax-efficient fund placement]] for details.

===Roth conversions===
You can evaluate a conversion of a traditional IRA to a Roth by its effect on your after-tax asset allocation.  If you are in the same tax bracket now that you expect to be in at retirement, and you pay taxes on the conversion with IRA money (or with money you would have otherwise contributed to a 401(k) or IRA), the conversion is break-even.  For example, if you are at a hypothetical 25% tax marginal rate and convert a $40,000 IRA, you will have $30,000 in the Roth after paying taxes.  Previously, you owned $30,000 of the IRA and the IRS owned the other $10,000; after conversion, you own the entire $30,000 in the Roth.

In contrast, if you pay the taxes with taxable money, you have a net gain, and it may even be worth making the conversion if you are going to be in a slightly lower tax bracket at retirement.  If you are in a hypothetical 28% marginal rate now but expect to retire at a 25% marginal rate, and have $11,200 in a taxable account and $40,000 in an IRA, you own 75% of the IRA and probably about 75% of the taxable account, a total of $38,400.  If you convert to a Roth, paying the taxes with the taxable $11,200, you will have a Roth worth $40,000.

===The advantage of a Roth===
If you can max out either a traditional or a Roth IRA or 401(k), you effectively get more tax-advantaged money with the Roth.  You can contribute the same number of dollars either way, but you own all of the Roth and not all of the traditional account.  See [[Traditional versus Roth#"Traditional plus taxable" vs. Roth|"Traditional plus taxable" vs. Roth]] for details.   

Investing in the Roth in this situation is equivalent to investing in a traditional IRA and immediately converting it to a Roth, paying the tax with after-tax dollars.  Therefore, if you are in a much higher tax bracket now than you will be in at retirement, the "traditional plus taxable"  accounts will be better, but if the brackets will be equal or close, you should prefer the Roth.  What constitutes "much higher" and "close" is situation-dependent, and the wiki section mentioned in the paragraph above suggests some tools to help evaluate that.

An [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/estatetax.asp estate tax] is assessed on the deceased’s estate on the value of applicable estate assets prior to passing to heirs. An [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inheritancetax.asp inheritance tax] is assessed on inherited assets and payable by the heirs. There is no federal inheritance tax, only a federal estate tax. At the state level, some states have estate taxes and a smaller number have inheritance taxes. As of 2025 only one state has both. 

Because of the high exemptions and state taxes only existing in some states, most investors will not pay any estate or inheritance tax. However, on large estates, the estate taxes owed can be very high, well into the millions of dollars. Fortunately, estate taxes can be reduced or eliminated through planning.

In the U.S. a person's '''gross estate''' consists of the total fair market dollar value of all property and assets in which a person had an interest at the time of their death. The gross estate figure is the gross value of a person's estate before liabilities such as debt and taxes are deducted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/grossestate.asp#ixzz23MnA38kE| title=Gross Estate: What It Is, How It Works, and Benefits| publisher=Investopedia| accessdate=July 4, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to assets included in a person's [[Net worth|net worth]], the gross estate includes assets such as the death benefit value of life insurance (owned or controlled by that person) as well as certain additional property interests. In addition, how property is titled, for example, as sole property or the variations of joint property, determine what needs to be included in the gross estate. The table below shows how many types of commonly held property are valued in the gross estate.

===529 plan estate benefits===
529 Plans confer a potential estate tax benefit to donors. Contributions to a 529 Plan are removed from the donor's estate and are transferred to the estate of the beneficiary. All yearly contributions below the $19,000 (2025 and 2026) per recipient gift tax provision are removed from a donor's estate, and a special tax provision allows donors to donate up to five years' gifts (currently $95,000) to a 529 plan in a single year without incurring gift tax. The donation is, for gift tax purposes, spread over the ensuing five years. The donations (prorated) are only brought back into the donor's estate if the donor dies or terminates the account within the five year extended period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://finaid.org/savings/529plans/#Contributions| title=Section 529 Plans| publisher=Finaid| accessdate=July 4, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If married, you and your spouse can "split gifts" and give $38,000 per recipient, and $190,000 for spreading the gift over five years. If you select the five year program you must elect it by filing IRS Form 790&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-709| title=About Form 709, United States Gift (and Generation-Skipping Transfer) Tax Return| publisher=IRS| accessdate=July 4, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt; You must also file this return for any year your gift to a beneficiary exceeds the annual gift tax exclusion limit. You must also file the 709 for any year in the five year spread period if you make any additional gift to the beneficiary.

==Federal estate tax==

===Federal exemptions and tax rates===

Each U.S. citizen has a lifetime estate tax exemption that allows a tax-free transfer of a set dollar amount to beneficiaries. The exclusion amount is $13.99&amp;nbsp;million in 2025&lt;ref name="Est"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-releases-tax-inflation-adjustments-for-tax-year-2025| title=IRS releases tax inflation adjustments for tax year 2025| publisher=IRS| accessdate=July 4, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/estate-tax-will-estate-have-29802.html| title=Estate Tax: Will Your Estate Have to Pay?| publisher=Nolo| accessdate=July 4, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt; and $15&amp;nbsp;million in 2026,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.thetaxadviser.com/news/2025/jun/details-of-tax-changes-in-senate-reconciliation-bill/| title=Tax provisions in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act| publisher=AICPA| accessdate=July 28, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt; and these amounts are indexed to inflation by law for future years. 

If you have given any taxable gifts during your lifetime, your estate tax exemption will be reduced by the amount of these taxable gifts. Usually, a taxable gift is a gift to another person over the [[Gift_tax#Annual_exclusion|annual gift tax exclusion]] ($19,000 per person per year, as of 2025) and to which one of the other exclusions don't apply. Taxable gifts are required to be reported in the year they are made on [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f709.pdf IRS Form 709]. See: [[Gift tax]] for more details.

The current federal estate tax rate is 40% for all taxable assets above the exclusion.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The IRS form that calculates estate taxes, [https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-706 Form 706], has an estate tax rate bracket structure analogous to the [[Progressive tax|income tax brackets]]. These brackets would make it seem as though assets less than $1&amp;nbsp;million over the exclusion would be taxed at graduated rates less than 40%. However, this is not the case because of the way the exclusion is applied. The exclusion is used to calculate an estate tax credit that is applied against the tentative tax owed on the estate without an exclusion. Because the top bracket is less than the exclusion amount, estate taxes are owed at 40% starting with the first dollar over the exclusion.&lt;/ref&gt; For historical context, past exclusions and maximum rates are shown in the following table:

===Portability for married couples===

A surviving spouse can retain use of any unused portion of a deceased spouse's individual tax exemption. This feature is known as ''portability''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.actec.org/resource-center/video/what-is-portability-for-estate-and-gift-tax/| title=What is Portability for Estate and Gift Tax?| publisher=The American College of Trust and Estate Counsel| author1=Jean Gordon Carter| author2=Stephen W. Murphy |accessdate=July 27, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.schwab.com/learn/story/how-portability-helps-couples-reduce-estate-taxes| title=How Portability Can Help Minimize Estate Taxes| publisher=Charles Schwab| accessdate=July 4, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt; Married couples can transfer an unlimited amount of assets to each other during life or at death entirely gift and estate tax-free. Using portability, when one spouse dies, the surviving spouse can add the unused portion of their deceased spouse's exemption to their own lifetime exemption. This gives the couple a total of $27.98&amp;nbsp;million in 2025 and $30&amp;nbsp;million in 2026,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.thetaxadviser.com/news/2025/jun/details-of-tax-changes-in-senate-reconciliation-bill/| title=Tax provisions in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act| publisher=The Tax Advisor| author=Alistair M. Nevius, J.D. |accessdate=July 27, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt; split between them in any way that provides the greatest tax benefit. 

Portability is '''not automatic.''' You must elect to port over your deceased spouse's remaining exemption by filing a U.S. Estate, Gift, and Generation-Skipping Return ([https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-706 Form 706]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Forum link|title=‪ Filing Federal Estate Tax Return to Get Portability‬.|p= 6756481 |author=Bruce Steiner|date=July 2, 2022}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Before portability became permanent,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.barrattorneys.com/blog/estate-tax-changes-portability-becomes-permanent/| title=Estate Tax Law Changes: How Portability Became Permanent| publisher=Barr &amp; Douds Attorneys| accessdate=July 4, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt; estates could accomplish this using [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditsheltertrust.asp credit shelter trusts], [[Trusts#Revocable_Living_Trusts_(RLTs)|bypass trusts]], and similar. 

Even if you don’t expect to end up with anywhere near the current estate tax threshold amount of wealth, it is generally a good idea for any material estate to file a form 706 as a form of insurance.&lt;ref&gt;[Https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=381048 Filing Federal Estate Tax Return to Get Portability]&lt;/ref&gt;  Estate tax limits frequently change, or you may live longer and experience more wealth appreciation than expected.  In addition, particular care is recommended in filling the form out, as mistakes can be costly&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/personal-finance/taxes/estate-taxes-portability-planning-mistakes-26111632?mod=taxes_trendingnow_article_pos1 The Estate Tax Mistake That Can Cost Families Millions]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=459507 wsj: the estate tax mistake that can cost families millions]&lt;/ref&gt;.  In most cases it is advisable to have an estate planning attorney to complete this task. 

Most states that levy a [[#State_estate_and_inheritance_taxes|state estate tax]] '''do not''' have portability. If you expect your estate to owe state estate tax in a non-portability state and portability would be a benefit, consider the use of trusts to achieve the same effect. 

====Example====

This example assumes the $15&amp;nbsp;million exemption for deaths occurring during 2026. Dr. Smith leaves $9&amp;nbsp;million to his widow; no estate tax is owed because property left to a spouse is tax-free. The widow then dies, leaving $28&amp;nbsp;million (her own $19&amp;nbsp;million plus the $9&amp;nbsp;million she inherited from her husband) to their children. Her estate will not owe any estate tax, even though the estate is over the exemption amount, because the estate can use $6&amp;nbsp;million of the husband's unused exemption. To take advantage of this provision, an estate tax return must be filed when the first spouse dies—even if no tax will be due.

===The taxable estate===

If the gross estate is subject to estate tax, the following deductions are allowable for determining the taxable estate:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/statistics/soi-tax-stats-estate-tax-study-terms-and-concepts#T| title=SOI Tax Stats - Estate tax study terms and concepts| publisher=IRS| accessdate=July 4, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Marital Deduction''': One of the primary deductions for married decedents is the Marital Deduction. All property that is included in the gross estate and passes to the surviving spouse is eligible for the marital deduction. The property must pass "outright." In some cases, certain life estates also qualify for the marital deduction. The marital deduction is not allowed to non-citizen spouses. (I.R.C. § 2056(a)){{#tag:ref|A non-citizen spouse can gain the benefits of the marital deduction by becoming a citizen of the United States. Estate values exceeding the personal exemption can also be left to a non-citizen spouse in a special type of trust, known as a Q-DOT ( "qualified domestic trust"). These trusts have special rules regarding beneficiary restrictions, estate tax obligations on distributions of trust principal, and are complex legal documents that must be created by an experienced estate lawyer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/estate-planning-when-you-re-married-noncitizen.html| title=Estate Planning for Noncitizen Spouses| publisher=Nolo| accessdate=July 4, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group="note"}}
*'''Charitable Deduction''': If the decedent leaves property to a [[Charity selection links|qualifying charity]], it is deductible from the gross estate. (I.R.C. § 2055(a))
*'''Mortgages and Debt'''.
*'''Funeral Expenses.'''
*'''Administration expenses of the estate.'''
*'''Losses during estate administration.'''
*'''State Death Taxes.'''

===When to file===
You must file Form 706 to report estate and/or Generation-Skipping Transfer (GST) tax within 9 months after the date of the decedent's death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-706| title=About Form 706, United States Estate (and Generation-Skipping Transfer) Tax Return| publisher=IRS| accessdate=July 4, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonresident aliens do not use Form 706, but instead use Form 706-NA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-706-na| title=About Form 706-NA, United States Estate (and Generation-Skipping Transfer) Tax Return| publisher=IRS| accessdate=July 4, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==State estate and inheritance taxes==

===State estate taxes===

For U.S. citizens, the federal estate tax applies only to very large estates (above $13.99&amp;nbsp;million in 2025). But many estates that do not owe federal tax ''do'' owe a separate state estate tax. It depends on where the deceased person lived and owned property.&lt;ref name="EstTax"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/state-estate-taxes.html| title=States With Estate Taxes| publisher=Nolo| accessdate=July 4, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2025, thirteen states have an estate tax.

Although the rules can vary by state, typically the following assets are included in the gross estate on which state estate taxes are calculated:

*For residents of the state, their taxable estate includes all intangible property (bank accounts, investments, life insurance, etc.) and all real and tangible property located in the state. Out-of-state real and tangible property is typically excluded from taxation.
*For non-residents, their taxable estate includes only real and tangible property located in the state, but not intangible property.

Note that even if you do not reside in a state that assesses an estate tax, you might need to file an estate tax return and even owe estate taxes if you own real or tangible property in a state that does.

In most states with an estate tax, the exemption is '''not''' [[#Portability_for_married_couples|portable]] between spouses like the federal exemption. If you expect to owe state estate taxes in a state without portability, consider additional planning, such as with [[trusts]].

The states imposing estate taxes are summarized in the tables below. Because estate and inheritance taxes are subject to frequent change, a link to each state's most relevant estate tax website is provided. Also included are links to a summary of each state's estate and inheritance tax, courtesy of the Nolo legal site. Note that there are nuances to how these taxes are applied, such as how the exact calculation is made, whether the exemption is portable between spouses, exclusions for certain types of property, and how states handle [[gift tax]].

===State inheritance taxes===

The estate tax gets a lot more attention, but people who inherit property may also have to pay a separate inheritance tax, which is imposed by five states (Maryland has both estate and inheritance taxes). Typically, inheritance taxes are based on where the ''decedent'' lived, not where the heir lives. If you inherit property from someone who lived in one of these states, you may end up paying some of your inheritance in taxes.&lt;ref name="InhTax"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/state-inheritance-taxes.html| title=Inheritance Tax: Which States Impose an Inheritance Tax| publisher=Nolo| accessdate=July 4, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt; But, if you live in a state with an inheritance tax and inherit assets from someone in a state with no inheritance tax, you will not owe inheritance tax except on real or tangible property they left you in your state.

Inheritance tax is a state tax only; the federal government does not have an inheritance tax. Inheritance tax is imposed in addition to the federal estate tax and any state estate tax.&lt;ref name="InhTax" /&gt;

Whether or not you will owe inheritance tax depends on how closely related you were to the person who left you money. It does not matter, in most states, how big the whole estate is or how much you inherit. You might owe state inheritance tax even if you inherit a small amount of property.&lt;ref name="InhTax" /&gt;

If you inherit from your spouse (or registered domestic partner or civil union partner), you are exempt from inheritance tax in all states. Charitable beneficiaries may also be exempt from the tax. Depending on state law, children who inherit either pay nothing or pay low rates. Certain types of assets (for example, life insurance) may also be excluded from taxation.&lt;ref name="InhTax" /&gt;

Although inheritance taxes are technically owed by the heir, not the estate, the estate executor is typically responsible for calculating and paying inheritance taxes before money is paid out to heirs. And, it is based on the decedent's residence, not the heirs. In these regards, estate and inheritance taxes are very similar, the main difference being:

*Estate taxes get a large exemption, but the rate on assets above the exemption does not depend on who receives the inheritance - except that transfers to a surviving spouse and charitable bequests are typically excluded from taxation
*Inheritance taxes get only a small exemption, or no exemption, but the rate depends on ''who'' inherits the assets, with close family members paying a low rate or being completely excluded from taxation

Like state estate taxes, the details of state inheritance taxes vary by the state and can change frequently, so if you live in a state with an inheritance tax, consult that state's taxing authority for details. The table below summarizes states that currently assess an inheritance tax:

===When to file===
Check with the relevant state, but they generally require a return filed within nine months from the date of death.

Also check for a tax discount. For example, Kentucky and Pennsylvania offer a 5% discount if taxes are paid within 9 and 3 months (respectively) of the decedent's death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://apps.legislature.ky.gov/law/statutes/statute.aspx?id=29001| title=Kentucky Revised Statute Section 140.160 (2025)| accessdate=July 27, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.pa.gov/services/revenue/make-an-inheritance-tax-payment.html#:~:text=Inheritance%20Tax%20payments%20need%20to%20be%20directed%20to%20the%20Pennsylvania,5%20percent%20discount%20is%20allowed.| title=Make an Inheritance Tax Payment| publisher=Commonwealth of Pennsylvania| accessdate=July 4, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Estate tax planning==

Although the federal estate tax exemption is large, the rate for assets above the exemption is high - 40%. When federal estate taxes are owed, it is likely millions of dollars. Some states also assess estate tax, and some have lower exclusions, as low as $1&amp;nbsp;million. State estate tax rates are typically around 16%. For those who will possibly or likely owe estate tax, additional planning is necessary. Estate tax planning typically has two goals: minimizing the tax owed, and ensuring any tax owed can be paid easily. 

The most obvious estate tax avoidance strategy is the use of [[#Portability_for_married_couples|portability]]. If there is a chance the surviving spouse could owe federal estate taxes, make sure to file [https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-706 IRS Form 706] to elect to port the deceased spouse's remaining exemption to the surviving spouse. This might be a good idea even if you doesn't expect to pay estate taxes, because the exemption could be lowered, you could have very good investment returns, you could receive an inheritance, and so on. Likewise, if the surviving spouse might owe state estate taxes in a state with a portable exemption, make sure to file the appropriate forms to transfer the unused exemption from the surviving spouse for that state. If you live in a state without a portable exemption, consider the use of [[trusts]], such as [https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/credit_shelter_trust credit shelter trusts] or [[trusts#Disclaimer Trusts|disclaimer trusts]], or other more sophisticated estate planning techniques to achieve a similar effect.

Another common estate tax avoidance strategy is to gift money while you are alive. The federal gift tax exclusion is $19,000 per person per year as of 2025, meaning gifts of up to this amount are not reportable and not potentially subject to [[gift tax]]. When the giver is married, this amount doubles, because both spouses get their own limit, and when the recipient is married, the amount doubles again because gifts can be given to both spouses. Tuition or medical expenses paid directly to the institution or provider are also exempt from gift taxes regardless of the amount. Beyond simple gifts, a competent estate planning attorney with experience planning for estate taxes in your state may be able to suggest additional, more complex, strategies to avoid estate tax. For high levels of assets, placing assets in [[trusts]], including [[trusts#Spousal Lifetime Access Trusts (SLATs)|Spousal Lifetime Access Trusts (SLATs)]], [https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/grantor-retained_annuity_trust Grantor Retained Annuity Trusts (GRATs)]  and/or [[trusts#Intentionally Defective Grantor Trusts (IDGTs)|Intentionally Defective Grantor Trusts (IDGTs)]], where future growth will occur outside your future estate, is often part of the plan.

If you will owe estate tax, make sure there will be enough cash inside your estate to pay the bill. For example, if most of your assets are taxable investments and retirement accounts, and these are left directly to beneficiaries, your executor may need to recover some of these assets from your beneficiaries to pay the estate tax. If your beneficiaries do not cooperate, your executor will need to sue them to recover money, creating expense and hassle for all parties. 

If you do not have enough assets that will be left directly to your estate to pay the estate tax, you can designate your estate to be a partial or total beneficiary of taxable accounts or life insurance policies. Inherited retirement accounts get more favorable tax treatment by beneficiaries (spouses can treat them as their own, other beneficiaries get some type of [[Stretch IRA|stretch]]), so these should be a lower priority than taxable assets and life insurance, but they can be partly left to the estate if necessary. 

Several factors make estate tax planning especially difficult. Estate taxes are a highly political issue, so tax laws change frequently (there was no estate tax at all in 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/information-for-executors| title=Information for Executors| publisher=IRS| accessdate=June 18, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;); they are likely to change again before you die. You could move to or from a state with a low estate tax exemption. And the exemption amounts are, and have historically been, indexed to inflation, so your net worth could exceed the exemption when you retire, but 30 years of spending and inflation could mean your estate ends up being far smaller than the exemption.

On the other hand, with modest spending and good investments you could die with many times ''more'' money than you retired with. In the [[Safe withdrawal rates|Trinity study]], retirees ''on average'' died with 2.7 times the portfolio size they had at retirement. Make the most reasonable assumptions you can given your situation, periodically check your plan, and adjust as needed.

==Non-US residents==
{{main|Nonresident alien taxation#Are nonresident aliens at risk from US estate taxes?}}
The estate tax exemption for U.S. citizens is not available to nonresident aliens. For these people, the U.S. estate tax exemption is just $60 thousand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/some-nonresidents-with-us-assets-must-file-estate-tax-returns| title=Some nonresidents with U.S. assets must file estate tax returns| publisher=IRS| accessdate=July 4, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt; Investors domiciled in Canada&lt;ref group="note&gt;Canada does not have a separate estate tax treaty with the US. Instead, the US maintains a single treaty with Canada that combines both income taxes and estate taxes. Under this combined treaty, Canadians receive protection up to the level of the US estate tax exemption allowed to US citizens, the same as generally provided by the separate US estate tax treaties for other countries. See: {{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/businesses/international-businesses/canada-tax-treaty-documents| title=Canada - Tax Treaty Documents| publisher=IRS| accessdate=August 9, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; or in one of the few countries with a [https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/estate-gift-tax-treaties-international US estate tax treaty] may be able to use a higher exemption, one that is pro-rated to that allowed to U.S. citizens, but check the treaty carefully. It is important to note that an investor's country of ''[[domicile]]'' is not necessarily the same as their country of ''residence''.

The following is a selection of nations (in addition to the U.S.) that impose an estate or inheritance tax:
* Belgium - '''''Droits de succession''''' or '''''successierechten''''' (Inheritance tax). Collected at the federal level but distributed to the regional level.
* Bermuda - '''Stamp duty'''
* Czech Republic - '''''Daň dědická''''' (Inheritance tax)
* Finland - '''''Perintövero''''' (Finnish) or '''''arvskatt''''' (Swedish) (Inheritance tax)
* France - '''''Droits de succession''''' (Inheritance tax)
* Germany - '''''Erbschaftssteuer''''' (Inheritance tax)
* Republic of Ireland - '''Inheritance tax''' (''Cáin Oidhreachta'')
* Italy - '''''Tassa di successione''''' (Inheritance tax)
* Netherlands - '''''Successierecht''''' (Inheritance tax)
* Norway - '''''Arveavgift''''' (inheritance and gift tax)
* Switzerland - Switzerland has no national inheritance tax. Some cantons impose estate taxes or inheritance taxes.
* United Kingdom - '''Capital Transfer Tax''' (inheritance tax)

If you have appreciated stock or mutual funds in your taxable account, you will have to pay capital-gains tax if you sell them.  However, by '''donating appreciated securities''' directly to a charity you can forgo paying tax as long as you have held the securities for more than one year.  (The deduction is limited to 30% of your adjusted gross income for most charities, rather than the usual 50% limit; consult your tax advisor or see [http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p526.pdf IRS Publication 526, Charitable Contributions] for details.)

The benefit of this type of donation is equal to the value of the tax deduction. If you donate $10,000 worth of a mutual fund and you paid $5,000 for the shares, you avoid a $5,000 long-term gain, saving $750 at the 15% tax rate.  The charity, since it is tax-exempt, can sell the shares itself and pay no tax.

Note that if you have shares with a loss, you should not donate them to charity; instead, you should sell them, claiming the capital loss which will reduce your taxable income, and then donate the sale proceeds to the charity.

==Donating securities at Vanguard==

To donate mutual funds with Vanguard, go to [https://personal.vanguard.com/us/literature Forms], then under "Change of Ownership", select "Giving Fund Shares to Organizations" to give shares of mutual funds; fill out the start of the form yourself and have the charity fill out the rest of the form.  If the charity does not wish to hold the fund, one of the options allows the charity to ask Vanguard to sell the fund and give it the proceeds in cash.  

To donate securities from a Vanguard brokerage account, select the form "Letter of Instruction for Gifts of Securities".  The charity must already have a brokerage account (not necessarily with Vanguard); you can get this information from the charity and fill out the form yourself.  If the charity also has a Vanguard brokerage account, you may need to use the "Change of Ownership between Nonretirement Accounts" form.

Since you pay no tax on the donation, you would usually want to donate your lowest-basis shares which have a long-term gain.  If you donate non-covered mutual fund shares, Vanguard will only provide average-cost information.  If you are using [[Specific identification of shares| specific identification of shares]] for tax purposes, you need to identify which shares are being donated in the same way; send Vanguard a secure E-mail, or enclose a letter with the form, which says, "Please donate $10,000 (or 123.456 shares) from the shares purchased on 1/2/04."   If you donate covered mutual fund shares, Vanguard will use your preferred lot identification method; if this is specific identification, you will have to include a similar letter because there is nowhere to select lots on the form.  If you donate securities from your brokerage account, you can specify lots on the form itself, and you can use specific identification even if this is not your default method.  (For example, you might want to sell shares automatically as highest-in-first-out, which usually minimizes taxes; when you donate, you would specify your lowest-basis shares.)

You cannot deduct the charitable contribution until the securities are transferred from your account; if you are donating mutual funds, you have to wait for the charity to fill out the paperwork after you send the form.  Therefore, if you want to get a deduction on this year's taxes, don't make the contribution very late in the year.  (In contrast, if you mail a check on December 31, it is deductible this year even if the charity deposits the check in January.)

These phaseouts were temporarily repealed by the 2018 tax law. The repeal was made permanent by the 2025 tax law.}}

The American Taxpayers Relief Act ('''ATRA''') imposes phaseouts of itemized deductions (known as Pease limitations)&lt;ref group="note"&gt; [[Wikipedia:Donald J. Pease | Donald J. Pease]], congressman from Ohio, drafted the limitations on itemized deductions which bear his name in 1990. See [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/68 26 USC § 68 - Overall limitation on itemized deductions], for the original law. &lt;/ref&gt; and for personal exemption phaseouts (known as PEP) for taxpayers whose adjusted gross incomes surpass threshold levels. The threshold levels were the same for both phaseouts. The thresholds took effect in 2013 and were scheduled to be adjusted for future inflation.

The TCJA passed in 2017 temporarily eliminated the Pease limitation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/how-did-tcja-change-standard-deduction-and-itemized-deductions| title=How did the TCJA change the standard deduction and itemized deductions?| publisher=Tax Policy Center| accessdate=July 5, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the elimination was made permanent in 2025.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.thetaxadviser.com/news/2025/jun/details-of-tax-changes-in-senate-reconciliation-bill/| title=Tax provisions in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act| publisher=AICPA| accessdate=July 5, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the [[wikipedia:One Big Beautiful Bill Act|OBBBA]]. This 2025 bill permanently removes the Sec. 68 overall limitation on itemized deductions (known as the Pease limitation) and replaces it with a new overall limitation on the tax benefit of itemized deductions. The amount of itemized deductions otherwise allowable would be reduced by 2/37 of the lesser of (1) the amount of the itemized deductions or (2) the amount of the taxpayer’s taxable income that exceeds the start of the 37% tax rate bracket.

==Pease limitations on itemized deductions (repealed)==
The Pease limitation, revived by the ATRA, reduces the amount of a higher income taxpayer's itemized deductions by 3% of the amount by which the taxpayer's adjusted gross income exceeds an applicable threshold (see above table). The amount of itemized deductions reduced is limited to no more than 80%. Not all itemized deductions are subject to reduction. The following deductible expenses are excluded from the limitation:&lt;ref name= "CHH"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://tax.cchgroup.com/downloads/files/pdfs/legislation/ATPR.pdf| title=CHH Tax Briefing: American Tax Relief Act of 2013| publisher=CCH Group| date=January 3, 2013| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170627085748/https://tax.cchgroup.com/downloads/files/pdfs/legislation/ATPR.pdf| archive-date=June 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From National Council of Nonprofits:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.councilofnonprofits.org/public-policy/pease-limitation| title=American Taxpayer Relief Act - The Pease Limitation to Itemized Deductions| publisher=National Council of Nonprofits| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130208032720/http://www.councilofnonprofits.org/public-policy/pease-limitation| archive-date=February 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{blockquote|For example, an individual with an adjusted gross income of $350,000 &lt;nowiki&gt;[in 2013; the current limit is higher]&lt;/nowiki&gt; would be required to subtract $3,000 from their itemized deductions ($350,000 - $250,000 threshold equals $100,000 x 0.03 equals $3,000). The amount under the limit would be reduced in the example even further in the event that this taxpayer has itemized deductions of less than $15,000 because the 80 percent rule would apply.}}

Most taxpayers subject to the Pease limitation have enough itemized deductions that they take the full reduction; in particular, if they pay state income taxes, 80% of the state income tax alone is likely to be more than 3% of the excess amount.  Thus the usual effect of the Pease limitation is to increase the taxpayer's [[marginal tax rate]] by about 1%.  For example, in the 33% tax bracket, an extra $100 of income increases taxable income by $103, and the tax on $103 is $33.99, for a 33.99% marginal tax rate.

==PEP limitations on personal exemption==
The ATRA also revives the phaseout on personal exemptions. Under the law, the total exemptions that may be claimed by a taxpayer is reduced 2% for each $2,500 ($1,250 for married filing separate) by which the taxpayer's adjusted gross income exceeds an applicable threshold.&lt;ref name="CHH"/&gt; For example, the 2017 personal exemption of $4050 will be reduced by 10% to $3645 if the taxpayer is $12,500 above the threshold, and will go away completely if the taxpayer is $125,000 above the threshold.  Since every $10,000 of income reduces exemptions by $332 each, and increases the tax bill by $110 in a 33% bracket, the taxpayer's marginal tax rate increases by about 1% per exemption; with four exemptions, the 33% tax bracket becomes about a 37% marginal rate (and 38% with Pease).

Since the passage of the 1983 Amendments to the Social Security Act&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ssa.gov/history/1983amend.html|title=SUMMARY of P.L. 98-21, (H.R. 1900) Social Security Amendments of 1983-Signed on April 20, 1983|website=Social Security|accessdate=31 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social Security benefits are subject to taxation.  

The amount of [[Social Security]] income which is taxable depends on your Social Security income and your other income.  Most high-income retirees will have 85% of Social Security benefits taxable.  For lower-income retirees, less than 85% will be taxable, but many retirees in a 12% tax bracket will face a [[marginal tax rate]] much higher than 12%. Social security benefits are also taxable in some states (see Figure 1).

For social security taxes imposed on earned wages, see the [[Payroll tax]] article.

==The formula==
{{See also|Tax analysis#Derivation of tax rate boundaries for Social Security taxation| label 1=Derivation of tax rate boundaries for Social Security taxation}}

The full rules are in IRS Publication 915.&lt;ref name="pub915"&gt;[https://www.irs.gov/publications/p915 IRS Publication 915]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Calculation of taxable benefits is done in two steps. First, ''Worksheet A'' is used to determine if your benefits are taxable. If so, ''Worksheet 1 through 4'' (select one based on filing method) is used to calculate the tax.&lt;/ref&gt; This simplification covers most cases; there are special rules if you contribute to a [[Traditional IRA]], receive retroactive payments for prior years, or file forms to exempt other income from taxation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bogleheads%27 Guide to Retirement Planning]], Chapter 11; this is the main reference for the formulas above, as it is much easier to follow than the IRS guide.&lt;/ref&gt;

The relevant income for Social Security taxation includes all items which are normally part of your adjusted gross income, plus tax-exempt interest income, plus 50% of your Social Security benefits. (Historically, the 50% represents the fact that half of your Social Security contributions were made by your employer and thus not taxed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p915.pdf IRS Publication 915, Social Security and Equivalent Railroad Retirement Benefits]&lt;/ref&gt;)

There are two relevant base amounts; unlike most income limits in the tax code, they are not adjusted for inflation.  The lower base is $25,000 if you are single, $32,000 if married filing jointly.  The upper base is $34,000 if you are single, $44,000 if married filing jointly.&lt;ref name="pub915" /&gt;

If your relevant income is below the lower base, none of your benefits are taxable.  For every $1 of relevant income between the lower and upper bases, 50 cents of your Social Security benefits become taxable, up to 50% of your total benefits.  For every $1 of relevant income above the upper bases, 85 cents of your Social Security benefits become taxable, up to a total taxable amount of 85% of your benefits.&lt;ref name="pub915" /&gt;

==Examples==
{{Notice|See: [[Tools_and_calculators#Personal_finance_toolbox |Personal finance toolbox]] - the tool used to generate charts below - for your own situation.}}
The examples below are based on tax numbers for 2025.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Tax bracket is based on Taxable income from {{Cite web| title=IRS releases tax inflation adjustments for tax year 2026, including amendments from the One, Big, Beautiful Bill|url=https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-releases-tax-inflation-adjustments-for-tax-year-2026-including-amendments-from-the-one-big-beautiful-bill|access-date=November 27, 2025|website=Internal Revenue Service}}&lt;/ref&gt; They illustrate how tax brackets and Social Security taxation interact, creating a 22.2% marginal tax rate for most taxpayers in the 12% tax bracket, and a 40.7% marginal tax rate (or slightly higher in the phase-out of the senior deduction) for
* Single taxpayers 65 and older with SS benefits above $33,959; at that SS, the marginal tax rate begins at ordinary income of $45,685;
* Married taxpayers 65 and older with SS benefits above $82,488; at that SS, the marginal tax rate begins at ordinary income above $78,185.

===Single taxpayers===

If you are single and receive $36,000 in Social Security benefits:
*None of your benefits are taxable if your other income is less than $7,000.
*For every dollar between $7,000 and $16,000, an additional 50 cents becomes taxable (although the tax is zero in this whole range; taxpayers with lower benefits may owe tax) 
*For every dollar over $19,000, an additional 85 cents becomes taxable, up to a total other income of $46,706, which makes the maximum $30,600 taxable.  

The table below assumes that you take the 2026 standard deduction ($24,150 for a taxpayer over 65, phases out by 6% of adjusted gross income over $75,000 to create an effective 23.32% tax bracket)

===Married taxpayers===

If you are a married couple, receive $72,000 in Social Security benefits and no other income except as described below:
*You are already in the 50% phase-in and $2000 of your benefits are taxable even with no other income (but the tax is zero)
*For every dollar up to $8,000, an additional 50 cents becomes taxable.  
*For every dollar over $8,000, an additional 85 cents becomes taxable, up to a total other income of $72,941, which makes the maximum $61,200 taxable. 

The table below assumes that you take the 2026 standard deduction ($47,500 for a married couple over 65, phases out by 12% of adjusted gross income over $150,000 to create an effective 24.44% bracket but it is not reached in this example)

With very high benefits and qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, it is possible to have an even higher marginal tax rate.  Here is an example of a married couple with $90,000 in Social Security and $20,000 in qualified dividends.  The qualified dividends are not taxed until their taxable income reaches $98,900.  But when that happens, each dollar of taxable income increases tax by 27 cents, as it is taxed at 12% and causes a dollar of qualified dividends to be taxed at 15% rather than 0%.  This creates a marginal tax rate of 49.95%, increasing to 54.83% when they also hit the phase-out of the senior deduction, then decreasing back to 29.64% once the maximum 85% of Social security is taxed.

In graphical form,&lt;ref name="MrMoney"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; assuming the OI comes from taxable IRA withdrawals/conversions, and starting the marginal rate calculations at $0 withdrawn/converted:&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:SS Married marginal rates chart1.png|alt=]]&lt;br /&gt;

If you have already made a $48.7K taxable IRA withdrawal (converted to Roth or not) and are considering a larger amount for the year, the marginal rates for amounts between $48.7K and $70K are shown here:

[[File:SS Married marginal rates chart2.png]]

There is no 40.7% rate in either of the above situations because the example couple reaches the maximum taxable SS benefit amount well before reaching the 22% tax bracket.

==Heat map representation==

Plotting marginal tax rates as a function of Social Security income (horizontal axis) and non-Social Security income (vertical access) gives the following "heat map" style plots.

[[File:SSHeatMapSingle2023.png|thumb|right|Marginal Tax Rate vs. Social Security and non-Social Security Income, 2025 Single Filers]]

[[File:SSHeatMapMFJ2023.png|thumb|right|Marginal Tax Rate vs. Social Security and non-Social Security Income, 2025 Married Joint Filers]]

The central point on each plot above which 40.7% marginal rates become possible can be calculated directly the formulas that describe taxation of Social Security, described above. As of 2026, these values are:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Filing Status !! 22% Threshold !! Standard Deduction !! Social Security !! Other Income
|-
| Single || $50,400 || $24,150 || $33,959 || $45,685
|-
| Married Joint || $100,800|| $47,500 || $82,488 || $78,185
|}

Taxpayers earning less Social Security income than these values are possibly affected by the 22.2% bump. As a function of annual Social Security benefit (SS), the 22.2% bump begins and ends at the following levels of income from other sources:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Filing Status !! 22.2% Bump Begins !! 22.2% Bump Ends
|-
| Single || $34,000 - 0.5 * SS || $28,706 + 0.5 * SS
|-
| Married Joint || $56,054 - 0.2297 * SS || $36,941 + 0.5 * SS
|}

Taxpayers earning more Social Security income than the above values are possibly affected by the 40.7% bump. As a function of annual Social Security benefit (SS), the 40.7% bump begins and ends at the following levels of income from other sources:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Filing Status !! 40.7% Bump Begins !! 40.7% Bump Ends
|-
| Single || $53,486 - 0.2297 * SS || $28,706 + 0.5 * SS
|-
| Married Joint || $97,135 - 0.2297 * SS || $36,941 + 0.5 * SS
|}

See the [[Tax_analysis#Derivation_of_tax_rate_boundaries_for_Social_Security_taxation|Tax analysis]] page for a derivation of these formulas.

===Examples===

A single taxpayer receiving $36,000 of Social Security benefits would be possibly affected by the 40.7% bump because the amount is more than $33,959. The 40.7% bump begins at '''$45,217''' ($53,486 - 0.2297 * $36,000) and ends at '''$46,706''' ($28,706 + 0.5 * $360,000). These values agree with the above charts except for a $1 rounding difference.

Married taxpayers receiving $72,000 of Social Security benefits would be possibly affected by the 22.2% bump, but not the 40.7% bump, because the amount is less than $82,488. The 22.2% bump begins at '''$39,516''' ($56,054 - 0.2297 * $72,000) and ends at '''$72,941''' ($36,941 + 0.5 * $72,000). These values also agree with the above charts except for a $2 rounding difference.

==State taxation==
[[File:State ssc tax large.png|thumb|right|300px|Figure 1.]]
While most states do not tax social security benefits (as of 2021, shaded blue in figure; along with gray shaded states which do not impose income tax; Missouri, Nebraska,&lt;ref&gt;[https://governor.nebraska.gov/press/governor-pillen-signs-historic-tax-cuts-package Governor Pillen Signs Historic Tax Cuts Package]&lt;/ref&gt; North Dakota,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.tax.nd.gov/news/tax-legislative-changes/updates-office-state-tax-commissioner-newsletters/income-tax-update Income Tax Update - Special Session 2021]&lt;/ref&gt; and West Virginia have eliminated the tax since this figure), eleven states (shaded pink or light blue) do tax them.

These states that tax benefits to the extent they are taxed at the federal level:&lt;ref name="taxesbystate"&gt; [https://www.retirementliving.com/taxes-by-state Retirementliving.com taxes by state]&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Minnesota'''
*'''Rhode Island'''

These states tax Social Security normally, but exempt all qualifying retirement income, including both Social Security and pensions, for retirees at a lower income level:&lt;ref name="taxesbystate" /&gt;
*'''Colorado'''
*'''Montana'''
*'''Utah'''

These states tax Social Security benefits only partially, or only at certain income levels:&lt;ref name="taxesbystate" /&gt;
*'''Connecticut''': Allows taxpayers to totally exempt Social Security from state income tax if income is less than $75,000 single, $100,000 married; above that, only 25% of federally taxed Social Security is taxed in CT.
*'''Kansas''': Exempts Social Security benefits from state taxation if federal adjusted income is less than $75,000.
*'''New Mexico''' : Benefits are exempt for a taxpayer 65 years of age or older, with income up to $100,000 single, $150,000 married filing jointly.
*'''Vermont''': Social Security is taxed only for income above $45,000 single, $60,000 married.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' involves special considerations for individual taxpayers. If you are a US citizen or resident alien, the rules for filing income, estate, and gift tax returns and paying estimated tax are generally the same whether you are in the United States or abroad. Your worldwide income is subject to US income tax, regardless of where you reside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/us-citizens-and-resident-aliens-abroad| title=U.S. Citizens and Resident Aliens Abroad| publisher=IRS| accessdate=July 25, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the tax issues confronting you are additional reporting requirements for foreign bank and investment accounts, along with a number of applicable exclusions, deductions, and tax credits. If you have a non-citizen spouse you face potential limitations on inheritance and gifting. If you renounce or relinquish citizenship, or abandon permanent residency, you may face additional special taxes.

==Definitions==
===US person===
For US tax purposes, US citizens and permanent residents (green card holders) living outside the US face the same filing requirements as US residents. Collectively, these are all 'US persons'.

If you hold a green card, you must formally surrender your status to free yourself from US tax filing requirements as a resident alien. The most common way to do this is to file Form I-407&lt;ref name="i-407"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.uscis.gov/i-407| title=I-407, Record of Abandonment of Lawful Permanent Resident Status| publisher=USCIS| accessdate=July 25, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; with USCIS, and then filing ''Form 8854, "Initial and Annual Expatriation Statement."'' with the IRS. See "[[#Expatriation tax for losing citizenship or permanent residency |Expatriation tax]]" below for further details.

:'''Warning''': If you are a green card holder, even living outside the US long enough that the card expires or that US immigration authorities consider it no longer valid for immigration ''does not change'' your tax and filing status for the IRS.

===Expatriate===
The IRS code defines "expatriate" as someone who has given up US citizenship or Permanent Resident (green card) status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/frequently-asked-questions-about-international-individual-tax-matters| title=Frequently Asked Questions About International Individual Tax Matters| publisher=IRS| accessdate=May 11, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; Take care not to confuse this with the more normal English meaning of the term "expatriate," which refers to a citizen of one country residing in another country, and is generally shortened to "expat."

For clarity, this article uses the terms "expatriate" and "expatriation" only in the specific IRS sense. It avoids the term "expat" and uses "US person living outside the US" or "US person living abroad" to mean US citizens and green card holders living in countries other than the US.

==Filing requirements==
===Form 1040===
If you are a US person living outside the US, you must still file tax returns with the IRS. You receive an automatic two month extension to the filing deadline.

===Report of foreign bank and financial accounts (FBAR)===
If the aggregate contents of ''all'' your financial accounts located outside the US exceeds $10,000 at any point in the year, you must file ''FinCEN Form 114, Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts (FBAR)''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.fincen.gov/report-foreign-bank-and-financial-accounts| title=FinCEN Form 114, Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts| publisher=US Treasury| accessdate=July 25, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.fincen.gov/news/news-releases/fincen-introduces-new-form-authorizing-fbar-filing-spouses-and-third-parties| title=FinCEN Introduces New Form for Authorizing FBAR Filing by Spouses and Third Parties| publisher=US Treasury| accessdate=July 25, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; (formerly ''Form TD F 90-22.1'') by April 15 of the following year, with automatic extension to October 15 for all filers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.fincen.gov/news/news-releases/new-due-date-fbars-0| title=New Due Date for FBARs| publisher=US Treasury| accessdate=July 25, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; This form goes to the Treasury Department, but '''not''' to the IRS — it goes to a different branch of the Treasury. As of 2013, you '''must''' file this form electronically; no other options are available. The BSA E-Filing System site&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://bsaefiling.fincen.treas.gov/main.html| title=BSA E-Filing System| publisher=US Treasury| accessdate=July 25, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; handles electronic filing.

:'''Warning''': For FinCEN Form 114 you must report not only accounts belonging to yourself but also any accounts over which you have signature authority, such as company or other organizational accounts.

===Statement of specified foreign financial assets (FATCA)===

''Form 8938, Statement of Specified Foreign Financial Assets'' (often referred to as the FATCA form),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-8938| title=Form 8938, Statement of Specified Foreign Financial Assets| publisher=IRS| accessdate=July 25, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; is similar to the FBAR, and reports almost the same information, but you file this form with the IRS along with your tax return.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Details are in [https://www.irs.gov/businesses/corporations/fatca-information-for-individuals FATCA Information for Individuals], from the IRS.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Form 8938 filing requirement does not replace or otherwise affect your obligation to file FinCEN Form 114 (FBAR,[[#Report of foreign bank and financial accounts (FBAR) | above]]). You have to file each form for which you meet the relevant reporting threshold. A comprehensive FAQ detailing requirements for each form can be found at the IRS: Comparison of Form 8938 and FBAR Requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Comparison-of-Form-8938-and-FBAR-Requirements| title=Comparison of Form 8938 and FBAR Requirements| publisher=IRS| accessdate=July 25, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foreign Earned Income Exclusion (FEIE)==

The IRS sums up the Foreign Earned Income Exclusion (FEIE):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/foreign-earned-income-exclusion| title=Foreign Earned Income Exclusion| publisher=IRS| accessdate=April 22, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quotation|If you are a U.S. citizen or a resident alien of the United States and you live abroad, you are taxed on your worldwide income. However, you may qualify to exclude from income up to an amount of your foreign earnings that is adjusted annually for inflation ($107,600 for 2020, $108,700 for 2021, $112,000 for 2022, and $120,000 for 2023 [$126,500 for 2024, $130,000 for 2025, $132,900 for 2026]).|IRS on the Foreign Earned Income Exclusion}}

You use ''Form 2555, Foreign Earned Income''&lt;ref name="Form 2555"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-2555| title=Form 2555, Foreign Earned Income| publisher=IRS| accessdate=July 25, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; to figure your FEIE.

The FEIE only applies to ''earned'' income (wages and salary), not to passive income (rent, interest, [[dividend]]s, capital gains). Where the work was performed determines where the income is deemed to have been earned, NOT where the money comes from. For example, if you live and work abroad and are paid by a US employer, it is foreign earned income (with exceptions for some government employees). If you live abroad and work for a foreign employer, and they send you to the US on business, the US considers all wages earned while physically in the US as US-source income. Also, income earned in international airspace, international waters, Antarctica, and even outer space, are all treated as US-source income.

Tax treaties&lt;ref name="Tax Treaties"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/Individuals/International-Taxpayers/Tax-Treaties|title=Tax Treaties| publisher=IRS| accessdate=July 25, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; may have the effect of returning the right of first taxation to a foreign government even for work performed in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/foreign-tax-credit-special-issues| title=Foreign Tax Credit — Special Issues (IRS)| publisher=IRS| accessdate=July 25, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; You may need to use a [[foreign tax credit]] for this case. For example, if you are a full-time resident of Japan, and your Japanese employer sends you to the US on a business trip, the US-Japan tax treaty&lt;ref name="US-Japan Tax Treaty"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/businesses/international-businesses/japan-tax-treaty-documents| title=US-Japan Tax Treaty Documents| publisher=IRS| accessdate=July 25, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; specifies that the income you earned while in the US is to be treated as though you earned it in Japan. You cannot, however, exclude this income from US taxation using the FEIE. Instead, you need to pay whatever Japanese taxes are due on the income, and then use the Additional Foreign Tax Credit worksheet&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/publications/p514/ar02.html#en_US_2012_publink1000244962| title=Additional Foreign Tax Credit Worksheet| publisher=IRS| accessdate=July 25, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the back of Pub. 514&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/publications/p514/index.html| title=IRS Pub. 514| publisher=IRS| accessdate=July 25, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; to calculate the foreign tax credit that you can take against the US taxes levied on that same income.

==Foreign Tax Credit (FTC)==
{{Main article|Foreign tax credit}}

You can take a Foreign Tax Credit (FTC) for foreign taxes paid on income that is not excluded using the FEIE. In some cases, where the foreign tax rate is high enough to more than cancel any US taxes due, it may be more advantageous to use only the FTC and forgo the FEIE — for example, to keep you eligible to make IRA contributions.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;You claim the foreign tax credit by filing [https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-1116 Form 1116 Foreign Tax Credit].&lt;/ref&gt;

There are significant limitations on your ability to switch back and forth between using the FTC and the FEIE. Regarding the FEIE, the IRS states:&lt;ref name="Instructions 2555"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/instructions/i2555/ch01.html#d0e181| title=Instructions for Form 2555| publisher=IRS| accessdate=July 25, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quotation|Once you choose to claim an exclusion, that choice remains in effect for that year and all future years unless it is revoked. To revoke your choice, you must attach a statement to your return for the first year you do not wish to claim the exclusion(s). If you revoke your choice, you cannot claim the exclusion(s) for your next 5 tax years without the approval of the Internal Revenue Service. See Pub. 54 for more information."|IRS on the Foreign Earned Income Exclusion}}

==Foreign housing exclusion or deduction==
You can take an exclusion or deduction for certain foreign housing-related expenses, to the extent that they exceed a certain threshold ($19,200/year in 2022). There is a cap on the amount that you can claim that varies by location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/instructions/i2555#limitonhousingexpensesworksheetline-eae47989| title=Instructions for Form 2555, Limits on Housing Expenses| publisher=IRS| accessdate=November 14, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; You use ''Form 2555, Foreign Earned Income''&lt;ref name="Form 2555"/&gt; to figure the exclusion or deduction.

The IRS describes what expenses are eligible:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/instructions/i2555#limitonhousingexpensesworksheetline-eae47989| title=Instructions for Form 2555, Limits on Housing Expenses| publisher=IRS| accessdate=November 14, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quotation|Line 28. Enter the total reasonable expenses paid or incurred during the tax year by you, or on your behalf, for your foreign housing and the housing of your spouse and dependents if they lived with you. You can also include the reasonable expenses of a second foreign household (defined later). Housing expenses are considered reasonable to the extent they are not lavish or extravagant under the circumstances.

Housing expenses include rent, utilities (other than telephone charges), real and personal property insurance, nonrefundable fees paid to obtain a lease, rental of furniture and accessories, residential parking, and household repairs. You can also include the fair rental value of housing provided by, or on behalf of, your employer if you have not excluded it on line 25.

Do not include deductible interest and taxes, any amount deductible by a tenant-stockholder in connection with cooperative housing, the cost of buying or improving a house, principal payments on a mortgage, or depreciation on the house. Also, do not include the cost of domestic labor, pay television, or the cost of buying furniture or accessories.|IRS Form 2555 instructions}}

US territories and possessions include American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, the US Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico.

{{quotation|American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico have their own independent tax departments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/publications/p570/ch03.html| title=Filing Information for Individuals in Certain U.S. Possessions| publisher=IRS| accessdate=July 25, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; If you have income from one of these US territories, you may have to file a US tax return only, a territory tax return only, or both returns. This generally depends on whether you are considered a resident of one of the US territories. In some cases, you may have to file a US return, but be able to exclude income earned in a territory from US tax. Filing requirements for specific US territories are explained in Publication 570.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/publications/p570/index.html| title=Publication 570, Tax Guide for Individuals With Income From U.S. Possessions| publisher=IRS| accessdate=July 25, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;|IRS}}

==Non-citizen spouses==
===Choosing a filing status===
If your spouse is a non-resident alien, and you wish to file as Married Filing Jointly, you will need to choose to treat your spouse as a US resident for tax purposes as noted in Publication 54:&lt;ref name="Publication 54: Nonresident Alien Spouse Treated as a Resident"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/publications/p54#idm140719117359312| title=Publication 54: Tax Guide for U.S. Citizens and Resident Aliens Abroad| publisher=IRS| accessdate=July 25, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quotation|If, at the end of your tax year, you are married and one spouse is a U.S. citizen or a resident alien and the other is a nonresident alien, you can choose to treat the nonresident as a U.S. resident. This includes situations in which one of you is a nonresident alien at the beginning of the tax year and a resident alien at the end of the year and the other is a nonresident alien at the end of the year.

If you make this choice, the following two rules apply.

* You and your spouse are treated, for income tax purposes, as residents for all tax years that the choice is in effect.
* You must file a joint income tax return for the year you make the choice.

This means that neither of you can claim under any tax treaty not to be a US resident for a tax year for which the choice is in effect.

You can file joint or separate returns in years after the year in which you make the choice.|IRS Publication 54}}

Once you make this election, it continues for all subsequent years. If you revoke it, you generally cannot ever choose it again.

:'''Warning''': Choosing to treat a nonresident alien spouse as a US resident creates US reporting requirements for all of that spouse's income and assets.

Publication 54 also notes:
{{quotation|If you do not choose to treat your nonresident alien spouse as a U.S. resident, you may be able to use head of household filing status. To use this status, you must pay more than half the cost of maintaining a household for certain dependents or relatives other than your nonresident alien spouse. For more information, see Publication 501.|IRS Publication 54}}

For further details, see Publications 54&lt;ref name="Publication 54: Nonresident Alien Spouse Treated as a Resident"/&gt; and 501.&lt;ref name="Publication 501: Head of Household"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/publications/p501| title=Publication 501: Head of Household| publisher=IRS| accessdate=July 25, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Special conditions on spousal inheritance and gift taxes===
Nolo provides a short summary of inheritance and gift tax issues with a non-US citizen spouse:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/estate-planning-when-you-re-married-noncitizen.html| title=Estate Planning When You’re Married to a Noncitizen| publisher=Nolo| accessdate=July 25, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quotation|'''Assets Left at Death'''

Assets left to a surviving spouse are not subject to federal estate tax, no matter how much they are worth, provided that the surviving spouse is a U.S. citizen. This rule is called the unlimited marital deduction. It is in addition to the individual exemption (currently $11.2 million) that everyone gets.

The marital deduction, however, does not apply when the spouse who inherits isn’t a U.S. citizen, even if the spouse is a permanent U.S. resident. The federal government doesn’t want someone who isn’t a citizen to inherit a large amount of money, pay no estate tax, and then leave the country to return to his or her native land.

Still, keep in mind you can leave assets worth up to the exempt amount (again, $11.2 million for deaths in 2018) to anyone, including your non-citizen spouse, without owing any federal estate tax. And if the non-citizen spouse dies first, assets left to the spouse who is a U.S. citizen do qualify for the unlimited marital deduction.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;There are two common strategies employed to allow a non-citizen spouse to receive the unlimited marital deduction.
# Get citizenship by the time the estate tax return is due.
# A non-citizen spouse can inherit free of estate tax through the use a special trust, called a "qualified domestic trust" or QDOT. Property is placed in the trust, instead of directly to your spouse. Your spouse is the beneficiary of the trust; there can’t be any other beneficiaries while your spouse is alive. Your spouse receives income that the trust property generates; these amounts are not subject to estate tax. The trust must be established prior to the filing of the estate tax return. The trustee of the trust must be a US citizen or US corporation. See [https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/using-qdots-plan-noncitizen-spouses.html A Qualified Domestic Trust (QDOT)], nolo.com. A QDOT requires expert professional guidance. It is important to realise that a QDOT does not avoid US estate tax, but only defers it until withdrawals of principal or the death of the surviving spouse.&lt;/ref&gt; 

'''Gifts Given During Life'''

If your spouse is a citizen, any gifts you give to him or her during your life are free of federal gift tax. If your spouse is not a U.S. citizen, however, the special tax-free treatment for spouses is limited to $152,000 a year (2018). This amount is indexed for inflation. That’s in addition to the $11.2 million you can give away or leave to anyone without owing federal gift/estate tax.|NOLO}}

These problems apply not only to US persons abroad, but to any US person who is married to a non-US citizen.

=== Establishing permanent residency in US===

It is possible for the foreign spouse (or other immediate relative) of a US citizen to apply for US permanent residency while still outside the US. According to the US Citizenship and Immigration Services:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.uscis.gov/green-card/green-card-through-family/green-card-immediate-relative-us-citizen| title=Green Card for an Immediate Relative of a U.S. Citizen| publisher=USCIS| accessdate=July 25, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quotation|If you are currently outside the United States and are an immediate relative of a U.S. citizen, you can become a permanent resident through consular processing. Consular processing is when USCIS works with the Department of State to issue a visa on an approved Form I-130 petition when a visa is available. You may then travel on the visa and will officially become a permanent resident when admitted at a U.S. port of entry.|USCIS}}

For details, see the USCIS "Consular Processing" page.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.uscis.gov/green-card/green-card-processes-and-procedures/consular-processing| title=Consular Processing| publisher=USCIS| accessdate=July 25, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Expatriation tax for losing citizenship or permanent residency==
===Loss of status===
====US Citizens====
The two primary ways to lose US citizenship are:
* '''Relinquishing US citizenship:''' If you take the citizenship of another country with the intent of relinquishing US citizenship, you are considered to have "relinquished" US citizenship. You still have to notify your local US embassy in person for the loss to be recognized by the US government, however. On November 9, 2015, the consular processing fee for relinquishment rose from zero to $2,350.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2015/09/08/2015-22054/schedule-of-fees-for-consular-services-department-of-state-and-overseas-embassies-and| title=Schedule of Fees for Consular Services, Department of State and Overseas Embassies and Consulates-Passport and Citizenship Services Fee Changes| date=September 8, 2015| publisher=Federal Register| accessdate=July 25, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Renouncing US citizenship:''' You can also "renounce" US citizenship, which requires you to take an oath of renunciation at a US embassy or consulate. This costs a $2,350 processing fee as of September 12, 2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2014/08/28/2014-20516/schedule-of-fees-for-consular-services-department-of-state-and-overseas-embassies-and| title=Schedule of Fees for Consular Services, Department of State and Overseas Embassies and Consulates-Visa and Citizenship Services Fee Changes| date=August 28, 2014| publisher=Federal Register| accessdate=July 25, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; and potentially subjects you to application of the [[wikipedia:Reed_Amendment_(immigration)|Reed Amendment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1182#a_10_E| title=Reed Amendment| publisher=Cornell Law School| accessdate=July 25, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For tax purposes, relinquishment and renunciation are identical, with your tax filing obligation continuing up until the date of the appointment at the embassy or consulate. For other purposes (such as transmitting US citizenship to your children), your effective date of loss of citizenship is the date of the relinquishing act (such as acquiring another citizenship with intent to relinquish US citizenship), or if renouncing, the date you take the renunciation oath at the embassy or consulate.

:'''Warning''': Even if you take another citizenship intending to relinquish, if you then travel on your US passport, vote in a US election, or do anything else that indicates that you still consider yourself a US citizen after the presumed expatriating act, you will be deemed not to have relinquished after all, at which point renouncing may become the only recognized way for you to lose US citizenship.

====Green card holders====
The elective ways to lose a US green card are:
* '''Abandoning US permanent residency:''' This is similar to relinquishing US citizenship. You need to file ''Form I-407, Abandonment of Lawful Permanent Resident Status''.&lt;ref name="i-407" /&gt;
* '''Claiming US tax treaty benefits:''' A long-term permanent resident claiming treatment as a resident of another country and not waiving tax treaty treatment for that country is deemed to have lost permanent resident status.&lt;ref name="expatriation_tax"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/Individuals/International-Taxpayers/Expatriation-Tax| title=Expatriation Tax| publisher=IRS| accessdate=July 25, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first of these is the cleanest, and by far the most common. Prior to July 1, 2019, you could file Form I-407 with the USCIS field office in the local US embassy. After this date, you have to file this form directly with the USCIS in Vermont,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.uscis.gov/news/alerts/uscis-will-no-longer-accept-i-407-at-international-field-offices| title=USCIS Will No Longer Accept I-407 at International Field Offices| publisher=USCIS| accessdate=November 1, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; although a rare exception may be possible. The estimated processing time is 60 days, so you need to take this into account in any planning.

:'''Warning''': If you hold a green card you must formally surrender your status to free yourself from US tax filing requirements as a resident alien. Allowing the physical card to expire so that US immigration authorities consider it no longer valid for immigration ''does not change'' your tax and filing status for the IRS.

===Tax consequences===
In either case of losing citizenship, or in the case of losing permanent residency if you have been a lawful permanent resident of the US in at least eight of the past fifteen years, the tax implications are similar. You need to file ''IRS Form 8854, Initial and Annual Expatriation Statement'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-8854| title=IRS Form 8854 Initial and Annual Expatriation Statement| publisher=IRS| accessdate=July 25, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; and potentially pay exit taxes based on a deemed disposition of assets and a deemed ''immediate distribution of all pension and retirement savings''.

The cases described above are the most common ones, but there are many special cases and exceptions, and different rules apply for those who lost citizenship or residency in previous years. For details, see ''Instructions for Form 8854'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/instructions/i8854/ar01.html#d0e29| title=Instructions for Form 8854| publisher=IRS| accessdate=July 25, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the IRS discussion of the expatriation tax.&lt;ref name="expatriation_tax" /&gt;

This is also an area where the laws have changed frequently in recent years, and the tax traps here are numerous and severe, so be ''very'' careful if you plan on taking any of the above steps.

==Investing as a US person living abroad==

===Investing from within the US===
====401(k) and Roth 401(k) contributions====
If you have access to [[401(k)]] or Roth 401(k) plans, it may be worth thinking about what order to make contributions to what kind of plan. For example, it may make sense to make pre-tax contributions to a 401(k) until you no longer have taxable income (with the remainder being untaxed due to application of reductions such as the FEIE, the Standard Deduction, and the Personal Exemption), and make post-tax contributions with any amounts above that.

====IRA and Roth IRA contributions====
If you use the FEIE, you cannot use any of the excluded income to contribute to an [[Roth IRA|IRA]]. You can contribute if you have earned income above the FEIE limit, and below the IRA contribution cutoff. You can also contribute using earned income that is not excludable (for example, wages you earn during a business trip to the US, which are considered US-source income even if paid by a non-US employer).&lt;ref group="note"&gt; In the case of spousal IRAs, your spouse's non-excluded income can be used to found a spousal IRA. Pub 590 is quite clear on this question:
# Taxable compensation for IRA contribution purposes does not include income excluded under the FEIE or housing exclusions, but if one spouse has taxable compensation over this exclusion, the excess income can fund an IRA contribution.
# A spousal contribution can be made for the lower earning spouse using income from the higher earner. The spouse whose taxable compensation exceeds the FEIE can therefore provide this excess taxable comp for the other lower earning spouse. In other words, the excess taxable comp of the higher earning spouse does not have to be applied to the remaining FEIE of the lower earning spouse. &lt;/ref &gt; 

You do not have to use the FEIE, but if you do use the FEIE, you have to use all of it, and exclude all income that is excludable up to the exclusion limit. It is NOT possible to partially exclude eligible earned income and leave some un-excluded for IRA contributions.

===Investing locally (from outside the US)===
If you invest where you live, you need to be aware of several issues and hindrances caused by US tax rules.

====Passive foreign investment company (PFIC)====
{{Main article|Passive foreign investment company}}

[[Mutual fund]]s, [[Exchange-traded funds|exchange-traded fund]]s (ETFs), [[Real estate investment trust |real estate investment trust]]s (REITs) and other collective investment vehicles, if they are not registered with the US Securities Exchange Commission (SEC), are classified under US tax law as Passive Foreign Investment Companies, or PFICs. The taxation on these under US law is ''extremely'' unfavorable, and requires you to file ''Form 8621, Information Return by a Shareholder of a Passive Foreign Investment Company or Qualified Electing Fund''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-8621| title=Form 8621, Information Return by a Shareholder of a Passive Foreign Investment Company or Qualified Electing Fund| publisher=IRS| accessdate=July 25, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; with your tax return, which can be an extremely time consuming task.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/instructions/i8621/ar02.html#d0e1437| title=IRS Form 8621 instructions: Disclosure, Privacy Act, and Paperwork Reduction Act Notice| publisher=IRS| accessdate=July 25, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, to avoid PFIC issues, you can only invest through SEC-registered investment vehicles (which may in turn incur tax problems with the local tax authorities), or otherwise through individual [[Stock basics|stocks]] and [[Bond basics|bonds]].

For a discussion of how to invest using individual stocks, see the Wiki page on [[Passively managing individual stocks|passively managing individual stocks]].

If you live in the UK, you need to use HMRC 'reporting funds' to avoid the UK's higher tax rates for gains in offshore (to the UK) funds. A selection of US domiciled ETFs are HMRC reporting funds. For more, see the Wiki page on [[US domiciled ETFs that are UK HMRC reporting funds]].

====Forms W-9 and W-8BEN====
If, as a US person, you open a financial account outside the US that deals with US securities (brokerage dealing in US stocks and ETFs, for example), you account provider should give you a Form W-9&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-w-9| title=Form W-9, Request for Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) and Certification| publisher=IRS| accessdate=July 25, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; to fill out. This form identifies owners of US securities who are US persons, and tells your brokerage NOT to withhold US taxes from US-source distributions, since you will declare them on your US tax return separately.

If you are a US person, you should NOT fill out a Form W-8BEN.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-w-8-ben| title=Form W-8BEN, Certificate of Foreign Status of Beneficial Owner for United States Tax Withholding| publisher=IRS| accessdate=July 25, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; This form is for non-resident aliens, and will typically result in US taxes being automatically withheld on distributions. (If you do find yourself subject to automatic withholding for some reason, this does not relieve you of the requirement to report the distributions on your US taxes, it just makes the job more complicated.)

====US-based brokerages====

Because of FATCA, most non-US brokerages (and many US based ones) now refuse access to US persons living outside the US. However, [[Interactive Brokers]] welcome this client group.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;For more, see: [https://www.interactivebrokers.com/ Interactive Brokers home page].&lt;/ref&gt;

Several major US brokerages do not allow investors to open accounts from outside the US. Vanguard is one example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://personal.vanguard.com/us/LiteratureRequest?FW_Activity=FindLiteratureActivity&amp;FW_Event=specialnotice| title=Special notice to non-U.S. investors| publisher=Vanguard| accessdate=July 25, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is Schwab, which no longer offers accounts to residents of Japan.&lt;ref&gt;[[Investing from Japan for US citizens and US permanent residents#US-based brokerage|Investing from Japan for US citizens and US permanent residents § US-based brokerage]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Search the forum for suggested alternative brokerages and workrounds: [https://www.google.com/search?sitesearch=bogleheads.org&amp;q=Vanguard+ex-pat+site:bogleheads.org Vanguard ex-pat site:bogleheads.org - Google Search]&lt;/ref&gt;

====EU and UK residents and PRIIPs====

In 2018, the European [https://finance.ec.europa.eu/consumer-finance-and-payments/retail-financial-services/key-information-documents-packaged-retail-and-insurance-based-investment-products-priips_en PRIIPs] (''Packaged Retail and Insurance-based Investment Products'') regulation became effective. As a result it is now difficult or even impossible for EU residents to purchase US domiciled funds directly (although indirect purchases potentially remain possible&lt;ref group=note&gt;Forum member "finrod_2002" provides details of how an investor might use options trades to work around PRIIPs restrictions, in {{forum post|p=4386305|title=Re: European, dutch investor here: Is investing in VTI and VXUS still a good choice?|date=17 Feb 2019}}, viewed 28 Oct 2019.&lt;/ref&gt;). Shares purchased before the regulation came into effect can be kept and sold, but EU residents can generally no longer buy new shares of these funds or ETFs.

The UK left the EU in January 2020, but created its own 'UK PRIIPs' regime that is fully aligned with the EU PRIIPs, so PRIIPs restrictions continue to apply in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/draft-packaged-retail-and-insurance-based-investment-products-amendment-eu-exit-regulations-2019/packaged-retail-and-insurance-based-investment-products-amendment-eu-exit-regulations-2019-explanatory-information| title=Packaged Retail and Insurance-based Investment Products (Amendment) (EU Exit)| publisher=GOV.UK| accessdate=February 1, 2020}} Regulations 2019: explanatory information&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cross-border taxation==
In general, other countries do not recognize the tax-advantaged status of US accounts such as IRAs, 401(k)s, Coverdell ESAs, and 529 plans. And symmetrically, the US generally does not recognize other countries' tax-advantaged accounts either.

There are some limited exceptions, depending on tax treaty.&lt;ref name="Tax Treaties"/&gt; For example, the US-Canada tax treaty&lt;ref name="US-Canada Tax Treaty"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/businesses/international-businesses/canada-tax-treaty-documents| title=US-Canada Tax Treaty Documents| publisher=IRS| accessdate=July 25, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.canada.ca/en/department-finance/programs/tax-policy/tax-treaties/country/united-states-america-convention-consolidated-1980-1983-1984-1995-1997-2007.html| title=Convention Between Canada and the United States of America With Respect to Taxes on Income and on Capital| publisher=Government of Canada| accessdate=July 25, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides for cross-recognition of some (but not all) tax advantaged accounts in either country, as does the US-UK treaty.&lt;ref name="US-UK Tax Treaty"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/businesses/international-businesses/united-kingdom-uk-tax-treaty-documents| title=US-UK UK Tax Treaty Documents| publisher=IRS| accessdate=July 25, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; But the US-Japan treaty,&lt;ref name="US-Japan Tax Treaty"/&gt; for example, has no such provisions, so Japan will treat a Roth IRA as just another taxable account, and the US will do the same with a NISA (Japan's equivalent to a Roth IRA).

===Canadian tax advantaged accounts===
Canadian registered retirement savings plans (RRSPs) and registered retirement income funds (RRIFs) held by US citizens can receive tax exempt status.&lt;ref name="collins"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.bakertilly.ca/en/btc/publications/u.s.-tax-treatment-of-certain-canadian-tax-deferred-accounts| title=U.S. Tax Treatment of Certain Canadian Tax-Deferred Accounts| publisher=Baker Tilly| accessdate=July 12, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;In 2014, the IRS eliminated the requirement to report RRSPs on ''Form 8891, U.S. Information Return for Beneficiaries of Certain Canadian Registered Retirement Plans''. (Ref: [https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-simplifies-procedures-for-favorable-tax-treatment-on-canadian-retirement-plans-and-annual-reporting-requirements IRS Simplifies Procedures for Favorable Tax Treatment on Canadian Retirement Plans and Annual Reporting Requirements], Oct. 7, 2014). However, [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/rp-14-55.pdf Revenue Procedure 2014-55] Sections 5, 6, and 7 suggest this Form be filed to report on [https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-8938 Form 8938] that they have filed Form 8891 with respect to an RRSP or RRIF.&lt;/ref&gt;

Registered education savings plans (RESPs) and Tax-Free Savings Accounts (TFSAs) cannot receive tax exempt status and may be subject to additional tax filings.&lt;ref name="collins" /&gt;

A special provision of the U.S. tax code, known as '''step-up in basis''',&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.irs.gov/Help-&amp;-Resources/Tools-&amp;-FAQs/FAQs-for-Individuals/Frequently-Asked-Tax-Questions-&amp;-Answers/Interest,-Dividends,-Other-Types-of-Income/Gifts-&amp;-Inheritances/Gifts-&amp;-Inheritances Is the money received from the sale of inherited property considered taxable income?], IRS &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/1014 26 USC § 1014 - Basis of property acquired from a decedent], Legal Information Institute, Cornell University Law School &lt;/ref&gt; applies to appreciated taxable assets at death.&lt;ref group="note"&gt; Not all assets qualify for stepped-up valuation. Retirement accounts, annuities, and savings bonds are some of the more commonly held accounts and assets that the IRS considers ''income in respect of a decedent'' and does not step-up in value after the owner dies. See [[Income in respect of a decedent]] for additional information.&lt;/ref&gt;

In most instances, a property's tax basis is stepped-up to the fair market value at the time of the decedent's death.

If both of the following conditions hold, an election can be made to instead use a valuation date six months after the date of death.&lt;ref&gt; {{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=26 U.S. Code § 1014 - Basis of property acquired from a decedent|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/1014|access-date=March 10, 2022|website=Legal Information Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two conditions are:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=July 27, 2020|title=Should You Elect the Alternate Valuation Date for Estate Tax?|url=https://www.otcpas.com/advisor-blog/elect-alternate-valuation-date-estate-tax/|access-date=March 10, 2022|website=Olsen Thielen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The estate must be subject to federal estate tax (in 2020, estates greater than $11,580,000 are subject to federal tax)
* The use of the alternate date must reduce the value of the gross estate and the amount of federal estate tax due

Step-up in basis can differ, however, depending on how the property is titled.

==Property titling and step-up in basis==
The actual tax basis of stepped-up property will differ depending on how the property is titled. 

===Sole property===
For sole ownership and sole or separate property&lt;ref group="note"&gt; In community property states, '''separate property''' is property owned and controlled entirely by one spouse in a marriage. At divorce, separate property is not divided under the state's property division laws, but is kept by the spouse who owns it. Separate property includes all property that a spouse obtained before marriage, through inheritance, or as a gift. It also includes any property that is traceable to separate property, and any property that the spouses agree is separate property. - ''from'' [http://www.nolo.com/dictionary/separate-property-term.html Nolo dictionary of legal terms], separate property &lt;/ref&gt; held in a revocable trust the death of the asset owner results in the asset's stepping-up in value.

{| class="wikitable"
|''Example'':

::Fred Mason, deceased, owns stock mutual fund investments that have a tax basis of 50,000 dollars with a current market value of 100,000 dollars. Fred also has a home with a basis of 70,000 dollars and a current market value of 125,000 dollars. Both assets are held in his own name. The beneficiaries of Fred's estate will have a new stepped-up valuation of the inherited assets:

:::*Stock mutual fund investments: 100,000 dollar tax basis 
:::*Real estate property: 125,000 dollar tax basis
|}

===Joint tenancy===
For assets held in joint tenancy, stepped-up valuation applies only to the deceased partner's share of the property.

{| class="wikitable"
|''Example'':

:: Fred and Mary Mason are married and hold their investment accounts and home in joint tenancy with right of survivorship. Their jointly held stock mutual fund investments  have a tax basis of 50,000 dollars with a current market value of 100,000 dollars. Their  home has a basis of 70,000 dollars and a current market value of 125,000 dollars. When Fred dies, Mary inherits the assets held in joint tenancy (without probate)&lt;ref group="note"&gt; Although joint ownership allows a spouse to inherit assets without probate, the surviving spouse now holds the property as a sole owner. At this juncture, using a revocable living trust or payable on death accounts is often recommended for asset ownership rather than joint tenancy with non-spousal partners. The potential problems associated with these joint tenancies include:
# The joint ownership means giving away part ownership of the property. The new owner can sell or mortgage their share -- or lose it in a lawsuit or divorce.
# You may have to file a gift tax return.
# The joint owner inherits all of the property after death; this may not be what the owner of the  property intends. &lt;/ref&gt; and has a new stepped-up basis for Fred's share of the assets.

:::*Stock mutual fund investments: 75,000 dollar tax basis
:::*Home residence: 97,500 dollar tax basis (35,000 + 125,000/2)
|}

===Community property=== 
Community property steps up whenever a spousal partner dies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Putnam mutual fund account application guide|url=https://www.putnam.com/literature/pdf/FM503-cfe844c44a057727d7bd1e118c83c08a.pdf|access-date=February 11, 2022|website=Putnam Investments|series=Registration type (Community property)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{| class="wikitable"
|''Example'':

:: Fred and Mary Mason are married and live in a community property state. They hold their investment accounts and home as community property. Their stock mutual fund investments have a tax basis of 50,000 dollars with a current market value of 100,000 dollars. Their home has a basis of 70,000 dollars and a current market value of 125,000 dollars. When Fred dies and leaves his half of the community property to his children by a previous marriage, Mary and the children have the same new basis for the assets:

:::*Stock mutual fund investments: 50,000 dollar tax basis (step-up on half)
:::*Home residence: 62,500 dollar tax basis (step-up on half)

::If Fred and Mary held the assets as community property with right of survivorship, Mary’s basis would be:
:::*Stock mutual fund investments: 100,000 dollar tax basis (step-up on both halves)
:::*Home residence: 125,000 dollar tax basis (step-up on both halves)
|}

==Step-down valuation==
If a decedent's adjusted basis in property is higher than the fair market value, the beneficiary's basis will equal the fair market value of the property at the time the decedent dies.&lt;ref group="note"&gt; In addition to step-down valuation, it should also be noted that capital losses and carry over losses must be deducted on a decedent's final tax return and cannot be carried over in the following years. See [http://www.irs.gov/publications/p544/ch04.html#en_US_publink100072659 Publication 544, Sales and Other Dispositions of Assets], IRS &lt;/ref&gt;

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a tax imposed on a child's "certain unearned income" at the parent's [[Marginal tax rate|marginal rate]].&lt;ref name="Kid"&gt;{{Cite web|title=26 USC 1: Tax imposed|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/1)|website=Cornell Legal Information Institute|series=26 U.S. Code § 1(g)}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|"'''Unearned income defined.''' Unearned income is generally all income other than salaries, wages, and other amounts received as pay for work actually performed. It includes taxable interest, dividends, capital gains (including capital gain distributions), the taxable part of social security and pension payments, certain distributions from trusts, and unemployment compensation. Unearned income includes amounts produced by assets your child obtained with earned income (such as interest on a savings account into which you deposited wages)."&lt;ref name="Pub929" /&gt;|group="note"}}

The term is found in the title of "''IRS Topic No. 553 Tax on a Child's Investment and Other Unearned Income (Kiddie Tax)''", but not in any other IRS publication.&lt;ref name="Topic553"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Topic No. 553 Tax on a Child's Investment and Other Unearned Income (Kiddie Tax)|url=https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc553|website=Internal Revenue Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;You won’t find the term "kiddie tax" in Publication 929 ({{Cite web|title=Publication 929 - Tax Rules for Children and Dependents.|url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p929.pdf|website=Internal Revenue Service}}) nor in the instructions for Form 8615, Tax for Certain Children Who Have Unearned Income ({{Cite web|title=Instructions for Form 8615|url=https://www.irs.gov/instructions/i8615|website=Internal Revenue Service}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Background:''' "In 1986, Congress enacted the 'kiddie tax' as a response to parental abuse of tax rates. Some parents were transferring large amounts of unearned income, such as dividend and capital gains proceeds, to their children’s accounts to ensure taxation at the children’s lower tax rates."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=May 23, 2006|title=The Real Effect of the “Kiddie Tax” Change|url=https://www.finance.senate.gov/chairmans-news/the-real-effect-of-the-kiddie-tax-change|website=United States Senate Committee on Finance}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the law has been modified multiple times.
==The kiddie tax in general==
There are two rules that may affect the tax and reporting of the investment income of certain children:&lt;ref name="Topic553" /&gt;
#If the child's interest, [[dividend]]s and other unearned income total more than $2,700 in 2025 or 2026 (twice the basic standard deduction for a dependent minor of $1,350, indexed for inflation&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The basic standard deduction is indexed for inflation. The unearned income limit is twice that amount. Source: [{{{url|https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/63}}} 26 USC 63:(c)(4)] and [{{{url|https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/1}}} 26 USC 1:(g)(4)(A)]&lt;/ref&gt;), it may be subject to a specific tax on the unearned income of certain children.
#If the child's interest and dividend income (including capital gain distributions) total less than $13,500 (10 times the basic standard deduction of $1,350), the child's parent may be able to elect to include that income on the parent's return rather than file a return for the child.  This may result in paying more tax than having the child file a tax return. (See [https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-8814-parents-election-to-report-childs-interest-and-dividends Form 8814] and [https://www.irs.gov/publications/p929 Publication 929].)
The following characterizes the kiddie tax:
* Applies if the child is &lt; 24 and a full time student (lower ages if not), and has more than $2,700 in unearned income for 2025 or 2026
*Anything over $2,700 in unearned income is taxed at the tax rate for the parents
*Kiddie tax is calculated on [https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-8615 Form 8615] and paid on child's return
*The standard deduction for a child who can be claimed as a dependent is the greater of
**$1,350 for 2025 or 2026 (indexed for inflation)
**earned income plus $450 for 2025, $450 for 2026 (indexed for inflation) but not more than the regular standard deduction amount, generally $15,000 for 2025, $16,100 for 2026 (indexed for inflation)
Note that by gifting appreciated securities to a child, you can avoid at most  $405 ($2,700 &amp;times; 0.15) in 2026 (if in the 15% [[Capital gains distribution|Long Term Capital Gains]] (LTCG) bracket), or $633 ($2,700 &amp;times; 0.238) (if in the 20% LTCG + 3.8% [[ACA net investment income tax|Net Investment Income Tax]] (NIIT) brackets).

==Taxation of children with no earned income==
If the children have no [[earned income]] then:
*The child (if a dependent) gets a Standard Deduction of $1,350
*This has the effect of:
**The first $1,350 of unearned income is untaxed
**The next $1,350 is taxed at the child's rate
***0% for [[qualified dividend]] (QDI) and long term capital gain (LTCG)
***10% for Interest and non-QDI
**Anything beyond that is taxed at the parents' tax rate
===Examples===
'''Example 1:''' Your child has no other income than $1,000 of LTCG from stock you gave him. His standard deduction is $1,350 and his taxable income is zero. You save $150 (15% of $1,000) in the 15% LTCG bracket compared to selling it yourself.

'''Example 2:''' Your child has no other income than $3,000 of LTCG from stock you gave her. Her standard deduction is $1,350 and her taxable income is $1,650.  In 2025, since her unearned income is over $2,700, the last $300 is taxed at the parents' rate; if the parents pay 15% tax on LTCG, the tax is $45.

'''Example 3:''' (2025 optimal [[tax gain harvesting]]) Your child has no other income than $2,700 of LTCG from stock you gave her. Her standard deduction is $1,350 and her taxable income is $1,350. In 2025, since her unearned income is exactly $2,700, she has $0 taxed at the parents' rate.
==Taxation of children with earned income==
If the children have earned income then:
*The standard deduction is $1,300 for 2024, $1,350 for 2025, or (earned income + $450 for 2024, $450 for 2025) whichever is larger, but not more than the normal standard deduction of $14,600 for 2024, $15,000 for 2025 (indexed for inflation) for a single person.
===Examples===
'''Example 1:''' A child has $200 of earned income. His standard deduction is $1,350. With $500 of ordinary unearned income (interest, short-term capital gains (STCG), and non-QDI) and $1,350 of tax advantaged unearned income (QDI and LTCG), his total income is $2,000, and his taxable income is $650. Under the "income stacking rules" of the Qualified Dividends and Capital Gain Tax worksheet, all of his taxable income is tax advantaged, and his tax is $0.

'''Example 2:''' A child has $1,200 of earned income. Her standard deduction is $1,650 ($1,200 + $450). With $500 of ordinary unearned income (interest, STCG, and non-QDI) and $1,400 of tax advantaged unearned income (QDI and LTCG) her total income is $3,050, and her taxable income is $1,400. Under the "income stacking rules" of the Qualified Dividends and Capital Gain Tax worksheet, the taxable income consists of $50 of ordinary income ($500 - $450) and $1,350 of tax advantaged income. Her tax will be $5 (10% of $50).
==Form 8514 - parents' election to report child's interest and dividends==
"You may be able to elect to include your child's interest and dividend income (including capital gain distributions) on your tax return. If you do, your child won't have to file a return."&lt;ref name="Pub929"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Publication 929, Tax Rules for Children and Dependents|url=https://www.irs.gov/publications/p929|access-date=September 20, 2021|website=Internal Revenue Service|series=Parents' Election To Report Child's Interest and Dividends (Form 8814)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''cafeteria plan''' or '''Section 125 plan''' (after the relevant Internal Revenue Code section) allows benefits such as health insurance to be paid by your employer and not counted in your salary. For example, if you have a $100,000 salary and have $5,000 paid by [[Payroll deductions|payroll deduction]], your [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fw2.pdf Form W-2] will list a salary of $95,000; if you do not use payroll deduction, your Form W-2 will list a salary of $100,000, but you might be able to deduct the $5,000 on your tax return if the tax laws allow it to be deducted. Your employer may give you the option to take some of these benefits (thus the name "cafeteria plan"), and if you do take them, you may have the option to use payroll deduction.

This page focuses on non-retirement benefits typically available by cafeteria plan deduction, and whether you should take them. For payroll deduction calculations generally, including taxes and retirement plans, see: [[Payroll deductions]].

__TOC__

==Eligible benefits==
The full list of eligible benefits is in [http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p15b.pdf IRS Publication 15-B, Employer's Tax Guide to Fringe Benefits].  The most common examples are health insurance, group life insurance up to a $50,000 benefit (anything above that is taxable to the employee if paid by the employer), [[Flexible Spending Account]]s for health and dependent care, and [[Health Savings Account]]s.

==Value to the employee== 

In some cases, cafeteria plan deductions are subsidized by the employer. For example, an employer-sponsored health insurance plan may cost the employee $2,000 per year via payroll deduction, but the employer may also contribute a similar amount, or possibly much more, to pay the full cost of the plan. Aside from [[#Tax_consequences|tax consequences]], this is a very valuable option to the employee, who would have to pay much more out-of-pocket to purchase a plan of similar quality on the open market.

===Tax consequences===

Because benefits paid by payroll deduction reduce your salary, they are exempt from federal income tax (and income tax in most states). For benefits that would otherwise not be tax-deductible, this represents a significant tax savings. 

Health insurance premiums paid directly to an insurer, not through a cafeteria plan, are deductible as medical expenses below-the-line on [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1040sa.pdf IRS Form 1040 Schedule A]. However, this is much worse than an above-the-line deduction like a payroll deduction, for these reasons:

* Below-the-line deductions are only available to those taxpayers who itemize deductions, which is not common due to the large standard deduction. As of 2019 only about 14% of taxpayers itemized deductions&lt;ref&gt;[https://taxfoundation.org/standard-deduction-itemized-deductions-current-law-2019 Tax Foundation - How Many Taxpayers Itemize Under Current Law?]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Medical deductions are subject to a 7.5% [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/agi.asp AGI] floor, meaning only expenses exceeding 7.5% AGI are deductible
* Below-the-line deductions do not reduce AGI, which is used to calculate phase-outs of many tax credits, such as the Child Tax Credit and the [[Saver's credit]]

This same reasoning also applies to planned medical expenses paid with a [[Health Savings Account]] or [[Flexible Spending Account]], although the use-it-or-lose-it nature of a FSA needs to be weighed against the potential tax savings. 

Even in cases where payroll deductions are otherwise deductible above-the-line, such as with HSAs, there may still be tax consequences for deducting through payroll versus directly on the [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1040.pdf individual tax return]. For example, [https://www.irs.gov/credits-deductions/individuals/earned-income-tax-credit-eitc Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC)] calculations consider the difference between earned income (Form W-2 box 1) and AGI. Likewise, [https://studentaid.gov/complete-aid-process/how-calculated Expected Family Contribution (EFC)] calculations are also affected, and while not technically a tax, it behaves as a tax. It's best to check for potential tax impacts with a [[Tax estimation tools|software tool]] or asking your accountant.

===Social Security===
{{Main|Social Security as an investment}}

Most benefits are also exempt from Social Security and Medicare tax, typically a 7.65% tax savings. Exemption from Social Security tax is not necessarily a benefit; if you pay less in Social Security tax, you might have lower Social Security benefits. To estimate the difference in the benefit, you need to check the [http://www.socialsecurity.gov/OACT/COLA/piaformula.html Social Security benefit formula].  Your Averaged Indexed Monthly Earnings (AIME) is your average monthly salary over your 35 highest-earning years, adjusted for wage growth over time; therefore, a $420 payroll deduction reduces your AIME by $1 (adjusted for wage growth). Your baseline future monthly benefit, called the Primary Insurance Amount (PIA), is calculated from AIME using three brackets: 90%, 32%, and 15%.

Taxpayers who expect to be in the 15% bracket (average annual wages over $93,488 as of 2025),&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/COLA/Benefits.html Average Indexed Monthly Earnings (AIME)], viewed 15 October 2024&lt;/ref&gt; your Primary Insurance Amount (the monthly benefit you receive at full retirement age) is reduced by 15 cents (indexed for inflation after you start receiving benefits) if your AIME is decreased by $1. The rate of return of Social Security tax is around 0 or negative, and is likely much worse than what can be expected from traditional investments. So, Social Security tax is usually best avoided. However, the reduced benefit also reduces your potential disability benefit, and your spousal and widow(er)'s benefit if you are married.

Taxpayers who expect to be in the 32% bracket (average annual wages between $15,432 and $93,488 as of 2026) can expect a modest rate of return on the taxes paid, which depends mostly on age, gender, and health, but also other factors; see the [[Social Security as an investment|main article]] for details on whether payroll taxes should be avoided in this case.

Taxpayers who expect to be in the 90% bracket (average annual wages below $15,432 as of 2026) can expect a very good rate of return on the taxes paid, and as a general rule should not avoid payroll tax where possible. 

If you are over the maximum earnings taxed by Social Security ($184.500 in 2026&lt;ref name="ssa._Bene"&gt;[https://www.ssa.gov/oact/cola/cbb.html Social Security Contribution and Benefit Base], retrieved 15 October 2024&lt;/ref&gt;) in any given year, payroll deduction does not affect your Social Security tax or benefits, but it does save you the 1.45% Medicare tax.

Some taxpayers have no change, or a very small change, in Social Security benefits when changing their Social Security tax; situations when this happens are listed [[Social_Security_as_an_investment#Situations_when_payroll_tax_provides_no_return_on_investment|here]].

==Should you use payroll deduction?==
===Health insurance===

If your employer offers health insurance with a substantial subsidy such that the cost of the payroll deduction is less than that of a similar plan on the open market, you should take the health insurance. Even if health insurance isn't subsidized, almost all taxpayers will realize a tax savings by paying health insurance premiums with payroll deduction, due to the way the deduction is [[#Tax_consequences|calculated]].

If the employer-sponsored health insurance is poor quality and/or overpriced, it could make sense to purchase a separate plan.
 
===Health Savings Account===

Taxpayers who are [[Health_savings_account#Basic_HSA_rules|eligible]] to contribute to a HSA have the option of contributing through an employer (if the employer offers this deduction) or directly to a HSA custodian. Usually, the difference is that the contribution is [[Payroll_-_FICA_tax_deductions|FICA tax-deductible]] when made through an employer, but not when made directly (although still income tax-deductible, on [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1040s1.pdf IRS Form 1040 Schedule 1] line 13). If the employee's total wages for the year are less than the Social Security Wage Base ($176,100 in 2025), this tax deduction likely causes a reduction in future Social Security benefits. Per an [[Social Security as an investment|analysis]] of benefits, low-earners should ''not'' avoid FICA tax, middle earners will roughly break even, and high earners should avoid FICA tax where possible. Taxpayers earning more than the Social Security Wage Base will only save the 1.45% Medicare tax and possibly the 0.9% Additional Medicare tax, but face no reduction in future benefits.

As mentioned [[#Tax_consequences|above]], in some cases there can be tax impacts from this decision aside from just FICA taxes, which should be factored in as well.

Some employers offer a match on HSA contributions made through payroll deduction, and this match likely outweighs any tax or Social Security benefit differences.

===Child and dependent care===

Child and dependent care expense deductions are typically available through a Dependent Care Flexible Spending Arrangement (DCFSA), a type of [[Flexible_spending_arrangement#Limited-purpose_FSA|limited-purpose FSA]]. Expenses paid by an employer (including through a DCFSA) are not eligible for the [https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc602 Dependent Care Credit], reported on [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f2441.pdf IRS Form 2441]; see also [http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p503.pdf IRS Publication 503]. The tax credit rate varies between 20% and 35% depending on AGI, but notably cannot phase out to less than 20% regardless of income. You should compare the tax savings from the FSA (which is at your [[Marginal tax rate|marginal tax rate]]) to the credit rate and choose the option with the higher rate, also considering any differences in [[Social Security as an investment|Social Security benefit]]. A DCFSA is a use-it-or-lose-it account, so the risk of unused savings should also be considered.

It is possible to both deduct dependent care expenses through payroll and also take the Dependent Care Credit, but the expense limit for the credit ($3,000 of expense for one dependent, $6,000 for two or more dependents) must be reduced by the amount deducted. For example, if a taxpayer has $15,000 of daycare expenses for two children and contributes $5,000 to their employer's DCFSA, they are eligible for the dependent care credit on only $1,000 (= $6,000 - $5,000) of qualifying expenses.

Note: For tax year 2021 only, the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Rescue_Plan_Act_of_2021 American Rescue Plan Act of 2021] expanded the Child and Dependent Care Credit to up to $8,000 of qualifying expenses for one dependent and up to $16,000 for two or more dependents. The credit rate also increased to up to 50% of qualifying expenses depending on income, although the credit phases all the way down to 0% for taxpayers with an AGI above $438,000. This one-year change is set to revert for tax year 2022 and beyond.

==Highly compensated and key employees==
{{Main|Highly compensated employee}}

Employer cafeteria plans which favor highly compensated employees as to eligibility to participate, contributions, or benefits, must include in their wages the value of taxable benefits they could have selected. A plan maintained under a collective bargaining agreement does not favor highly compensated employees.&lt;ref name="IRS"&gt;[https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p15b.pdf Publication 15-B, Employer's Tax Guide to Fringe Benefits] (Cafeteria Plans), viewed February 15. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Employer cafeteria plans which favor key employees must include in their wages the value of taxable benefits they could have selected. A plan favors key employees if more than 25% of the total of the nontaxable benefits provided for all employees under the plan go to key employees. However, a plan maintained under a collective bargaining agreement does not favor key employees.&lt;ref name="IRS" /&gt;

A key employee is generally an employee who is either of the following:&lt;ref name="IRS" /&gt;

*An officer having annual pay of more than $215,000 for 2023, $220,000 for 2024
*An employee who for that year is either of the following.
**A 5% owner of your business.
**1% owner of your business whose annual pay was more than $150,000.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Federal tax credits for individuals#Non-refundable tax credits|non-refundable tax credit]] for taxpayers who make eligible contributions to eligible retirement plans. The credit was first established for the tax years 2002 to 2006 under the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act of 2001 (EGTRRA, Sec. 618),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-107publ16/html/PLAW-107publ16.htm 2001 EGTRRA], reviewed 16 February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; and was made permanent under the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA), Sec. 801.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-109publ280/html/PLAW-109publ280.htm Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA)], reviewed 16 February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eligible taxpayers==
In order to qualify for the saver's credit, a taxpayer must meet three qualifications. The taxpayer must be:
*Age 18 or older;
*Not a full-time student;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Full-time student requirements,([http://www.irs.gov/publications/p590a/ch03.html#en_US_2014_publink1000231200 Pub 950A]):

*You are a full-time student if, during some part of each of 5 calendar months (not necessarily consecutive) during the calendar year, you are either:
*A full-time student at a school that has a regular teaching staff, course of study, and regularly enrolled body of students in attendance, or
*A student taking a full-time, on-farm training course given by either a school that has a regular teaching staff, course of study, and regularly enrolled body of students in attendance, or a state, county, or local government. &lt;br&gt;
Note that you are a full-time student ''if you are enrolled for the number of hours or courses the school considers to be full time''.&lt;/ref&gt; and
*Not claimed as a dependent on another person's return.

If filing MFJ and only one spouse qualifies, that spouse may claim the credit for contributions in their own name. See [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f8880.pdf Form 8880].

==Eligible plans==
The saver’s credit can be taken for contributions to a [[Traditional IRA|traditional]] or [[Roth IRA]], [[401(k)]], [[SIMPLE IRA]], [[SARSEP]], [[403(b)]], 501(c)(18) or governmental [[457(b)]] plan, voluntary after-tax employee contributions to qualified retirement and 403(b) plans, and ABLE accounts by the designated beneficiary.&lt;ref name="IRS"&gt;[https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/plan-participant-employee/retirement-savings-contributions-savers-credit Retirement Topics - Retirement Savings Contributions Credit (Saver’s Credit)] and [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-25-67.pdf IRS announcement of 2026 retirement contribution limits], reviewed 27 November 2025.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Income eligibility==
The amount of the credit is 50%, 20% or 10% of a taxpayer's retirement plan or IRA contributions, depending on adjusted gross income (reported on Form 1040 or 1040A).&lt;ref name="IRS"/&gt; For the purpose of this credit, only $2,000 per person of contributions is considered. For example, if only one person in a MFJ couple makes a contribution and that contribution is $6,000, only $2,000 will be considered for the saver's credit. If each spouse contributes $2,000, then $4,000 will be considered. See lines 6 and 7 of Form 8880 for details.

The tables below show qualifying income limits for selected tax years:

|}
&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;Single, married filing separately, or qualifying widow(er)

Note that the credit is based on Adjusted Gross Income. If you contribute to a deductible IRA or 401(k), this will lower your AGI and may make you eligible for a larger credit. You can even contribute to a deductible IRA for the previous year through April 15 of the current year in order to move to a different credit category.

==Testing period==
The saver's credit can be reduced or the taxpayer rendered ineligible for the credit if a taxpayer (or taxpayer's spouse if filing a joint return) receives a distribution from a qualifying retirement plan. There is a ''testing period'' imposed when taking the credit. The testing period is the ''two years preceding'' the year for which the credit is claimed, and/or January 1 to April 15 of the year ''following'' the year for which the credit is claimed. For example, if the saver's credit is claimed for 2014, distributions that occur during tax years 2012 and 2013, and from January 1, 2015, to April 15, 2015, could affect the individual's eligibility to claim the credit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.investopedia.com/articles/retirement/04/031704.asp Saver's Tax Credit: A Retirement Savings Incentive], Denise Appleby, Investopedia.

'''Tax credits for individuals''' can reduce your tax liability. They fall into two main groups: refundable tax credits, and non-refundable tax credits. 

==Tax credits==
Tax credits are often advantageous because you subtract them, dollar for dollar, from the tax you owe. In contrast, a tax deduction reduces your income tax due by your [[Marginal tax rate|marginal tax rate]]. Tax credits often have limitations, such as age requirements, or by taxpayer income levels.

The most common tax credits for investors are the [[Saver's credit | saver's credit]] that applies (subject to income limitations) if you make contributions to retirement savings plans, and the [[Foreign tax credit |foreign tax credit]], which applies if you hold international securities in [[taxable account]]s.

If you use tax-deferred education savings plans, such as [[529 plans]] and [[Coverdell Education Savings Account]]s, or use [[I savings bonds#Tax-free growth for Qualified Education Expenses|U.S. savings bonds]] for paying college costs, consider coordinating payments with the two education tax credits, the Lifetime Learning Credit and the American Opportunity Tax Credit.

===Refundable tax credits===
Your tax liability does not limit a refundable tax credit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/refundablecredit.asp| title=Refundable Credit: What it is, How it Works| publisher=Investopedia| accessdate=October 1, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that you get a refund from this tax credit even when it is more than the tax you owe.&lt;ref name="IRS"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/credits-deductions-for-individuals |title=Credits and Deductions for Individuals |publisher=IRS| accessdate=October 1, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only a few federal individual tax credits are refundable. Refundable credits include the Earned Income Tax Credit, the Premium Tax Credit (Affordable Care Act), the credit for Excess Social Security and RRTA Tax Withheld, and the Child Tax Credit.

The American Opportunity Tax Credit is a partially refundable tax credit (40% of the credit, up to $1,000).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/uac/American-Opportunity-Tax-Credit:-Questions-and-Answers| title=American Opportunity Tax Credit: Questions and Answers| publisher=IRS| accessdate=19 February 2015}}{{dead link}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-refundable tax credits===
The majority of federal individual tax credits are non-refundable. A non-refundable tax credit tax cannot reduce the tax you owe to less than zero.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nonrefundabletaxcredit.asp| title=Nonrefundable Tax Credit: Definition, How It Works, and Benefits| publisher=Investopedia| accessdate=October 1, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; A nonrefundable tax credit means you get a refund only up to the amount you owe for taxes.&lt;ref name="IRS"/&gt;

This page shows why it is better for a '''non-US investor''' who is a US [[Nonresident alien taxation|nonresident alien]] (commonly abbreviated to NRA) with '''poor or no coverage from a US income tax tax treaty''', or with '''poor or no coverage from a US estate tax treaty''', to invest in Ireland domiciled [[exchange-traded fund|exchange traded funds]] (ETFs) instead of the popular US domiciled [[mutual fund|mutual funds]] and ETFs discussed by US-based investors.

This page uses the rate of 30% for any [[dividend]] withholding calculations. This is the US dividend tax rate in the absence of a [https://www.irs.gov/businesses/international-businesses/united-states-income-tax-treaties-a-to-z US income tax tax treaty]. A ''poor'' US income tax treaty is one where the US dividend tax rate exceeds the 15% US/Ireland treaty rate.&lt;ref name="poor_treaty" group="note"&gt;The countries with poor US income tax treaties, ones that provide a US dividend tax rate that is above the 15% US/Ireland tax treaty rate, are Greece, Pakistan, Trinidad and Tobago, India, Israel, Philippines, Tunisia, and Turkey.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, US estate taxes begin at just $60,000 of US holding for nonresident aliens, and apply at rates of 26-40% of assets above that level in the absence of a [https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/estate-gift-tax-treaties-international US estate tax treaty]. Only fifteen countries have estate tax treaties with the US, and not all of these treaties are good ones. A ''poor'' US estate tax treaty is one that does not increase the US estate tax exemption for nonresident aliens to more than the standard $60,000 amount.&lt;ref name="poor_estate_treaty" group="note"&gt;The countries with poor US estate tax treaties, ones that appear not to raise the exemption above the standard $60,000 for nonresident aliens, are Ireland and South Africa.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Domicile ==
{{main|Domicile|Wikipedia:Domicile (law)}}
[[Domicile]] is a legal term for being a lawful permanent resident in a particular jurisdiction. Your domicile often determines your best options for investing. Investment funds also have a domicile, and here this too affects how they operate, including taxation.

== US tax treaties ==
{{Main article|Non-US investor's guide to navigating US tax traps|Nonresident alien's ETF domicile decision table}}
Depending on your country of residence, you may be able to benefit from a US tax treaty for lower rates on dividends from US domiciled ETFs, and higher exemptions from US estate taxes. In that case, some parts of this page may not apply directly.

Canada does not have a separate estate tax treaty with the US. Instead, the US maintains a single treaty with Canada that combines both income taxes and estate taxes. Under this combined treaty, Canadians receive protection up to the level of the US estate tax exemption allowed to US citizens, the same as generally provided by the separate US estate tax treaties for other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/businesses/international-businesses/canada-tax-treaty-documents| title=Canada - Tax Treaty Documents| publisher=IRS| accessdate=August 9, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2018, [[EU_investing#EU_legislation : UCITS, MiFID II and PRIIPs|European MiFID and PRIIPs regulations]] have made it difficult or impossible for European and UK investors to buy US domiciled funds.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Forum member "finrod_2002" provides details of how an investor might use options trades to work around PRIIPs restrictions, in {{forum post|p=4386305|title=Re: European, dutch investor here: Is investing in VTI and VXUS still a good choice?|date=17 Feb 2019}}, viewed 28 Oct 2019.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Why invest in Ireland domiciled ETFs? ==
A few reasons for US nonresident aliens to prefer Ireland domiciled ETFs over US domiciled ETFs:
* Ireland domiciled ETFs can benefit from the US/Ireland tax treaty rate of 15% on dividends and 0% on interest paid to Irish corporations,&lt;ref name="pwc"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.pwc.ie/publications/2020/tax-facts-2020.pdf| publisher=PwC| title=Ireland Tax Facts 2020| accessdate=July 25, 2020}} Appendix 2, "Withholding tax on payments to Ireland".&lt;/ref&gt; instead of 30% for US nonresident aliens in countries without a US tax treaty.
* Ireland domiciled ETFs insulate you from US estate taxes of up to 40% of the balance of US situated assets above $60,000.
* US domiciled ETFs holding non-US securities can suffer [[#Multiple levels of dividend tax withholding|double tax withholding]]. The US domiciled ETF pays withholding to international governments, then the US levies 30% of the remaining distributed dividends. Ireland domiciled ETFs avoid this.
* Complex and constantly changing [[Nonresident alien taxation|US tax laws affecting US nonresident aliens]]. Leave it to iShares and Vanguard Dublin to deal with those.
* Non-residents of Ireland are not liable to Irish gift tax or inheritance tax.&lt;ref name="cat"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.revenue.ie/en/tax-professionals/tdm/capital-acquisitions-tax/cat-part23.pdf| title=Part 23 - CAT Exemptions| publisher=Revenue Ireland| accessdate=September 21, 2020}} Section 23.6, "Exemption of certain investment entities".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="algoodbody"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.algoodbody.ie/media/InFocus-Taxation-Irish-regulated-funds1.pdf| publisher=A&amp;L Goodbody| title=An Overview of the Taxation of Irish Regulated Funds| accessdate=July 25, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Availability of [[Index funds and ETFs outside of the US#Accumulating (or capitalizing) and distributing ETF share classes|accumulating funds]] that reinvest dividends and which may help some investors reduce or avoid Level 3 tax. 
* For Europeans it has become difficult to buy US domiciled funds due to 2018 European MiFID and PRIIPs regulations.

== No Irish taxes of any kind for Ireland domiciled ETFs ==
{{Anchor|No Irish taxes}}
Ireland does not withhold or levy any taxes on capital gains from, or dividends paid by, Ireland domiciled UCITS ETFs for non-residents of Ireland.&lt;ref group=note&gt;A reply received from Saxo Bank customer support dated March 2015: "''Our corporate actions team replied that on VWRL there has previously been 0% tax.

The CAT exemption applies in the case of the transfer of units in an investment limited partnership notwithstanding that this type of entity has been removed from the definition of “investment undertaking” in section 739B(1) TCA 1997.|Revenue Ireland}}
Ireland applies no taxes of any kind on non-Irish residents who hold Ireland domiciled ETFs. Ireland domiciled ETFs are therefore completely 'tax transparent' to investors, making them preferable to US domiciled ETFs for investors in any country with poor or no US tax treaty coverage, and often acceptable to investors even in countries with good US tax treaty coverage.

== Multiple levels of dividend tax withholding ==
[[File:ETF taxes.png|thumb|Figure 1. Three levels of dividend taxation can apply to ETFs.|link=Special:Redirect/file/ETF taxes.png]]
If you own funds that hold securities, multiple countries can tax your dividends, with tax applied at multiple levels.{{#tag:ref|From a Canadian perspective, according to PWL Capital:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.advisor.ca/my-practice/continuing-education/foreign-withholding-taxes-how-to-estimate-the-hidden-tax-drag-on-u-s-and-international-equity-index-funds-and-etfs/| title=Foreign withholding taxes: How to estimate the hidden tax drag on U.S. and international equity index funds and ETFs| publisher=Advisor's Edge| accessdate=January 17, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Media:ETF taxes.png|Figure 1]] shows how and where you may face three levels of possible dividend tax:

* '''L1TW''': Percentage of tax withholding by a security's home country on dividends distributed by that security to the fund (Level 1). 
* '''L2TW''': Percentage of tax withholding by the country where the fund is domiciled on the dividends distributed to you by the fund (Level 2). 
* '''L3T''': Percentage of taxation that you need to pay in your home country (Level 3).

=== Estimating Level 1 dividend tax withholding paid by US domiciled funds ===
According to the PWL Capital white paper,&lt;ref name=pwl group=note /&gt; the following are the percentages of tax withholding paid by different types of US domiciled ETFs:

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center"
|-
! Fund type !! Fund used !! 2009 !! 2010 !! 2011 !! 2012 !! 2013 !! Five-year average
|-

|}

&amp;dagger; iShares MSCI EAFE ETF (EFA) excludes the US. You can use that number to approximate Level 1 taxes for the ex-US developed markets portion of the fund in question. If the US domiciled fund you are analyzing has 60% US stocks and 40% ex-US developed markets, the Level 1 tax withholding will be 0.40 &amp;times; 7.5% = 3.0% approximately.

Keep in mind that each index provider (MSCI/FTSE) has a different definition of "Developed Markets" and "Emerging Markets". Different indices have different allocations of those markets, too.

===Comparing the dividend yields shown on fund factsheets===
When looking at the dividend yield shown on an ETF's factsheet, take care to understand that for the portion of the dividend that comes from underlying US stocks, US domiciled ETFs will show this dividend portion as ''gross'', but Ireland domiciled ETFs will show it ''net of 15% US withholding tax''. This can make it appear as if Ireland domiciled ETFs pay out lower dividends. And in practice, they may (depending on what assets they hold); it is just that if you do not live in a country with a US tax treaty, you will lose 30% of every US domiciled ETF's dividend in broker US tax withholding, whereas there is no broker tax withholding for any country for an Ireland domiciled ETF.

For example, as of the date of writing, the factsheet for US domiciled [https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/voo Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF (VOO)] indicates a 1.74% dividend yield, whereas that for Ireland domiciled [https://www.vanguardinvestor.co.uk/investments/vanguard-s-and-p-500-ucits-etf-usd-distributing Vanguard S&amp;P 500 UCITS ETF (VUSA)] indicates a 1.47% dividend yield.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Notice here that VUSD's 1.47% is 85% of VOO's 1.74%. The missing 15% is the US withholding tax, US/Ireland tax treaty rate, paid internally by VUSD.&lt;/ref&gt; However, on payment of the dividend from VOO to a nonresident alien investor in a country without a US income tax treaty, 30% lost to US tax reduces the 1.74% dividend to an effective 1.218%. This is considerably less than the 1.47% that would be received from VUSD.

== Calculating dividend tax withholding as a ratio ==
To better compare different ETFs we can convert the tax withholding percentages into a total annual approximation of percentage 'tax drag'; call this the Tax Withholding Ratio ('''TWR'''). This makes it easily comparable to the expense ratios found on funds' fact sheets.&lt;ref&gt;{{forum post| p=2400735| title=Re: ETF portfolio for non-resident alien with no tax treaty}}, by Micks (and Galeno).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;For more about this method, see: "Tax withholding calculation indirectly mentioned by Canadian Couch Potato", in post [https://canadiancouchpotato.com/2012/09/17/foreign-withholding-tax-explained/"Foreign Withholding Tax Explained"]. Also, {{cite web| url=https://www.advisor.ca/my-practice/continuing-education/foreign-withholding-taxes-how-to-estimate-the-hidden-tax-drag-on-u-s-and-international-equity-index-funds-and-etfs/| title=Foreign withholding taxes: How to estimate the hidden tax drag on U.S. and international equity index funds and ETFs| publisher=Advisor's Edge| accessdate=January 17, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To calculate the dividend Tax Withholding Ratio (TWR), we need four pieces of information:
* '''L1TW''': Percentage of tax withholding by a security's home country on dividends distributed by that security to the fund (Level 1). This can be estimated using a fund's annual report, dividing "Non-reclaimable withholding tax" by "Dividend income".
* '''L2TW''': Percentage of tax withholding by the country where the fund is domiciled on the dividends distributed to the investor by the fund (Level 2). If you are a non-treaty [[Nonresident alien taxation|US nonresident alien investing in US domiciled ETFs]], that number is 30%. If you are investing in Ireland domiciled ETFs and you do not reside in Ireland, you [[#No Irish taxes of any kind for Ireland domiciled ETFs|do not have to pay any Irish tax withholding]]. 
* '''YIELD''': Gross yield of the assets held by fund.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;This is ''not'' necessarily the [[#Comparing the dividend yields shown on fund factsheets|same as the fund's indicated dividend yield]].&lt;/ref&gt; The best estimate will come from using the fund's annual report, dividing "Dividend income" by "Total assets under management". As you cannot know the amount of future dividends in advance, an approximation based on historical values (gross before withholding was paid) should be sufficient. Dividend yield is used in the formula as the Level 1 taxes are paid on dividends received by fund.
* '''TER''': The fund's Total Expense Ratio. This can be obtained from a fund's factsheet or KIID document.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;For background information on KIID requirements, see: {{cite web| url=https://www.mondaq.com/ireland/compliance/124598/the-kiid---a-summary-of-the-requirements-of-the-key-investor-information-document| title=The KIID - A Summary of the Requirements of the Key Investor Information Document| publisher=Mondaq| accessdate=January 17, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The calculation after that is rather simple:
 TWR = (YIELD &amp;times; L1TW) + ((YIELD &amp;times; (1 - L1TW) - TER) &amp;times; L2TW)
The first term in parentheses calculates the Level 1 leakage. The second term uses the ''remaining'' dividend, deducts the fund's TER&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Some countries allow funds to subtract the fund's TER before paying the dividends, others do not. Please review the taxation of the country where the fund is domiciled.&lt;/ref&gt; and then applies the individual's Level 2 tax to the remaining sum.

You can now add the TWR to the fund's published expense ratio (TER) to get a comparable total ratio paid annually. This number does not include the dividend tax that you may have to pay to to your home country on the dividends you actually receive. 

=== Example calculation for S&amp;P 500 ETFs ===
Let us compare the US domiciled [https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/voo Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF (VOO)] with Ireland domiciled [https://www.vanguardinvestor.co.uk/investments/vanguard-s-and-p-500-ucits-etf-usd-distributing Vanguard S&amp;P 500 UCITS ETF (VUSA)].

Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF (VOO):
* L1TW = 0%, as it is US domiciled, holding US securities
* L2TW = 30%, US nonresident alien rate for countries without a US tax treaty
* YIELD = 1.74%, estimated as we need it for comparison purposes, not exact dollar calculations
* TER = 0.03%
 TWR for VOO = {{TWR| L1TW=0| L2TW=30| Yield=1.74| TER=0.03}}

Vanguard S&amp;P 500 UCITS ETF (VUSA):
* L1TW = 15%, as it is Ireland domiciled, holding US securities&lt;ref name="pwc" /&gt;
* L2TW = 0%, no Irish tax withholding on UCITS funds
* YIELD = 1.74%, estimation, from VOO
* TER = 0.07%
 TWR for VUSA = {{TWR| L1TW=15| L2TW=0| Yield=1.74| TER=0.07}}

L1TW for VUSA can be also calculated using its annual report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.vanguardinvestor.co.uk/rs/gre/gls/1.3.0/documents/959/gb| publisher=Vanguard| title=Annual Report, Vanguard Funds plc - S&amp;P 500 section| accessdate=July 25, 2020}}{{dead link}}&lt;/ref&gt; For 2014, Foreign Withholding Tax (7,721,652) divided by Dividend Income (52,371,805) = 14.74%. 
[https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&amp;t=162636#p2442026 TedSwippet suggests] that it's not 15.0% on the dot due to a 2.5% REIT allocation, which may distribute dividends or capital gains at different rates than the US treaty rate of 15% for dividends. A tax drag differing from the treaty rate may for instance be caused by foreign companies in an index, capital gains being taxed differently than dividends and REITs can recharacterize distributed dividends as return of capital, which is not to be taxed. 

Including the funds' expense ratios: VOO's total cost is 0.54% for a nonresident alien with no US tax treaty, while VUSA's total cost is 0.33%. For this investor then, VUSA is the better holding.

=== Example calculation for FTSE World ETFs ===
Let us compare the US domiciled [https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/vt Vanguard Total World Stock ETF (VT)] with Ireland domiciled [https://www.vanguardinvestor.co.uk/investments/vanguard-ftse-all-world-ucits-etf-usd-distributing Vanguard FTSE All-World UCITS ETF (VWRL)].

Vanguard Total World Stock ETF (VT):
* L1TW &amp;dagger; = 0% &amp;times; 52% (US) + 9% &amp;times; [[#Estimating Level 1 tax withholding paid by US domiciled funds|10.8%]] (Emerging Markets) + 39% &amp;times; [[#Estimating Level 1 tax withholding paid by US domiciled funds|7.5%]] (ex-US developed) = '''3.9%''' 
* L2TW = 30%, US nonresident alien rate for countries without a US tax treaty
* YIELD = 2.0%, estimation as we need it for comparison purposes, not exact dollar calculations
* TER = 0.08%
&amp;dagger; Ratios of US/EM/DM obtained from VT's Vanguard.com portfolio page.
 TWR for VT = {{TWR| L1TW=3.9| L2TW=30| Yield=2.0| TER=0.08}}

Vanguard FTSE All-World UCITS ETF (VWRL):
* L1TW = [[#Estimating Level 1 tax withholding paid by Ireland domiciled funds|10.3%]]
* L2TW = 0%, no Irish tax withholding on UCITS funds
* YIELD = 2.0%, estimation, same as used for VT
* TER = 0.19%
 TWR for VWRL = {{TWR| L1TW=10.3| L2TW=0| Yield=2.0| TER=0.19}}

Including the fund expense ratios: VT's total cost is 0.711% for a nonresident alien with no US tax treaty, while VWRL's total cost is 0.396%. For this investor, VWRL is the better holding. As allocation to countries changes over time, the tax drag will change over time as well. Also as yield changes over time, the tax drag will change over time as well.

== Taxation of investments from outside of the country of the investor (dividend withholding tax leakage) ==
If you own funds that hold securities, multiple countries can tax your dividends, with tax applied at multiple levels. Depending on the tax treaties (for example, [[#US_tax_treaties | US tax treaties]] or [[Nonresident_alien_taxation#US_estate_taxes | US estate taxes]]) you can face dividend withholding taxes by the fund's domicile country, the country where the fund's assets are located, or both. 

These dividend withholding taxes will apply before any tax you have to pay to your home country.

=== International withholding tax ===
As explained above, funds themselves will be taxed internally on the dividends they receive from individual stocks they hold. 

Funds that are domiciled in Ireland are liable to foreign (most notably, US) dividend withholding taxation. As of 2020 there is no easily accessible way for individual investors to recuperate these foreign withholding taxes incurred by funds domiciled in Ireland. This international withholding tax loss is often referred to as "'''dividend tax leakage'''". While this is highly technical fiscal material, you need to carefully consider the effect of foreign withholding tax on their investment because it lowers your expected returns.

See [[#Estimating Level 1 dividend tax withholding paid by Ireland domiciled funds|Estimating Level 1 dividend tax withholding paid by Ireland domiciled funds]] above for some common figures on well known funds.

=== Distributing ETF example: FTSE All-World UCITS ETF (VWRL) ===
The Vanguard [https://www.vanguard.nl/portal/instl/nl/en/product.html#/fundDetail/etf/portId=9505/assetCode=equity/?overview FTSE All-World UCITS ETF (VWRL)] fund notes 9.8% percent Level 1 dividend tax withholding for each percent of dividend yield received during the year 2014. Assuming a typical 2% dividend yield, we can estimate the dividend leakage as follows:

* 9.8% dividend withholding of a 2% gross dividend = '''0.20%''' dividend leakage

On the other hand, funds gain some income from "securities lending". Vanguard states that it lends some of the securities, although this seems to only add 0.01% to the performance of this fund.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://occaminvesting.co.uk/best-vanguard-passive-index-tracker-fund-uk/#lending| title=The best Vanguard passive index tracker funds for UK investors| publisher=Occam Investing| accessdate=December 26, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2025, the FTSE All-World charges an 0.19% ongoing cost figure (OCF). But for investors, an additional estimated 0.20% would be lost to foreign withholding tax, and 0.01% would be gained from securities lending. This brings the total estimated figure of cost and taxation incurred by the fund itself to '''0.38%'''. A significant difference although an average 10% dividend leakage is likely lower than the Level 1 dividend withholding rate that the investor can obtain themselves. 

A simpler way to account for dividend leakage without delving into balance sheets is to look at the difference between reported fund return (performance) and ''gross'' index benchmark return. When funds report annual returns they usually measure these against ''net'' index benchmark returns. This is the gross index return minus a tax index benchmark. 

=== Accumulating ETF example: FTSE All-World UCITS ETF (USD) Accumulating (VWRA) ===
When we compare the Vanguard [https://www.nl.vanguard/professional/product/etf/equity/9679/ftse-all-world-ucits-etf-usd-accumulating FTSE All-World UCITS ETF (USD) Accumulating (VWRA)] fund to its [https://www.ftserussell.com/analytics/factsheets/home/historicindexvalues?groupname=ftse%20global%20equity%20index%20series gross benchmark] published by FTSE Russell for 2019 we obtain these figures:

* A gross index return of 27.22%
* A net index return of 26.53% - this takes into account the "typical" Level 1 taxation. 
* A reported fund return of 26.52%

First, the reported fund return is only 0.01% lower than the net index return of 26.53%. A difference that is not intuitive due to the stated (as of 2019) 0.22% total expense ratio of the fund. This is likely due to the fact that the tax index benchmark used to obtain the net index return overestimates the 15% withholding tax tariff on US dividends. See the average 10% figure computed in [[Nonresident_alien_investors_and_Ireland_domiciled_ETFs#Estimating_Level_1_dividend_tax_withholding_paid_by_Ireland_domiciled_funds|Nonresident alien investors and Ireland domiciled ETFs]]. This is also one of the reasons why the fund sometimes "outperforms" the net index benchmark.

Secondly, there is a difference of almost '''0.7%''' between the reported fund return and gross index benchmark. 0.25% of that is explained by the funds' stated expense ratio for 2019. The remainder of that difference consists of dividend leakage, the internal transaction cost, the income from securities lending etc.

==US estate tax considerations==
If you live in a country without a US estate tax treaty, and where total US situated holdings are below $60,000, your might base your choice of whether to use US domiciled or Ireland domiciled ETFs on which will return the dividends from the underlying stocks in the most tax-efficient way.

Where your total US situated holdings exceed $60,000 however, the risk of US estate tax can dominate the decision. For example, the US tax treaties with Bulgaria, China, Mexico, Romania and Russia allow investors in these countries a 10% US tax withholding rate on dividends. This is below the 15% US/Ireland tax treaty rate, and so may make US domiciled ETFs a slightly more tax-efficient way to receive dividends from US stocks. However, none of these countries has a US estate tax treaty. If you live in one of these countries and hold more than $60,000, you may nevertheless prefer Ireland domiciled ETFs over US domiciled ones.

==Other country capital gains, estate and inheritance tax==
As noted [[#No Irish taxes|above]], unless you are an Irish resident, Ireland does not apply a capital gains tax, inheritance tax, or any other capital transfer or acquisitions tax, to any Ireland domiciled ETFs that you hold.

Also, the exchange where you buy and hold Ireland domiciled ETFs does not add any new capital gains tax, gift tax, or estate or inheritance tax risks. For example, you could buy them on the London Stock Exchange without any risk of them later becoming liable for UK capital gains tax or UK inheritance tax, and similarly for Frankfurt, Paris, and so on. You can simply use the exchange that is most convenient for you.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' summarizes how the US applies its taxes to a '''non-US investor''' (specifically, a US '''nonresident alien''') holding assets such as US stocks, US bonds, US cash deposits, and US domiciled ETFs and mutual funds.

Non-US investors may face both US dividend withholding taxes and US estate taxes, on top of any taxation by their country of residence. There can also be a risk of US gift taxes.

== Who is a nonresident alien (NRA)? ==
{{main|Domicile}}
If you are an alien (that is, you are not a US citizen), the US considers you to be a nonresident alien unless you meet one of two tests. You are a resident alien of the United States for tax purposes if you meet either the [https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/alien-residency-green-card-test green card test] or the [https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/substantial-presence-test substantial presence test] for the calendar year (January 1-December 31).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/determining-an-individuals-tax-residency-status| title=Determining an Individual’s Tax Residency Status| publisher=IRS| accessdate=June 11, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In short, if you are not a US citizen or green card holder and have not been in the US for 183 days (calculated over a 3 year period), you are a nonresident alien for US tax purposes.

== How does the US classify types of income for nonresident aliens? ==
For nonresident aliens, US source income falls into one of two classifications:
* Effectively connected income (ECI).&lt;ref name="eci"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/effectively-connected-income-eci| title=Effectively Connected Income (ECI) |publisher=IRS| accessdate=Jun 22, 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is income received from engaging in a trade or business in the US. Aside from [[US tax pitfalls for a non-US person moving to the US#J, F, M and Q visa holders|J, F, M and Q visa holders]], few nonresident alien investors will receive this type of US income. The US taxes ECI income at regular US graduated income tax rates.
* Fixed, determinable, annual, and periodic (FDAP).&lt;ref name="fdap"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/fixed-determinable-annual-periodical-fdap-income| title=Fixed, Determinable, Annual, Periodical (FDAP) Income| publisher=IRS| accessdate=Jun 22, 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is, broadly, US source income that is not connected with operating a US trade or business. For example, US bank and broker interest, US stock dividends, rent received, pensions, and annuities. This would be the most common type of income nonresident aliens receive from the US, for example, from directly holding US stocks or US domiciled ETFs. The US taxes FDAP income at either a flat 30% rate or any lower treaty rate, although with some notable exceptions,&lt;ref name="exclusions"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/nonresident-aliens-exclusions-from-income| title=Nonresident Aliens - Exclusions From Income| publisher=IRS| accessdate=Jun 25, 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt; in particular [[#Is interest taxable for a nonresident alien?|most interest]].
The remainder of this article deals only with fixed, determinable, annual, and periodic (FDAP) income.

== Are capital gains taxable for a nonresident alien? ==
No. The US does not tax nonresident aliens on capital gains from US domiciled ETFs and US stocks. According to IRS Publication 519:&lt;ref name="p519"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p519.pdf| title=Publication 519, U.S. Tax Guide for Aliens| publisher=IRS| accessdate=July 25, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{blockquote|A nonresident alien usually is subject to U.S. income tax only on U.S. source income. If you were in the United States for less than 183 days during the tax year, capital gains are tax exempt unless they are effectively connected with a trade or business in the United States during your tax year.|IRS Publication 519}}

Also, according to a reply received for a paid consultation with Greenback Expat Tax Services Limited:

{{blockquote|Investing in ETFs will not count as effectively connected income and therefore any capital gains from the sale of these will be tax free as a nonresident.|Greenback Expat Tax Services Limited}}

== Is interest taxable for a nonresident alien? ==
Sometimes. Although the US generally classifies US source interest as fixed, determinable, annual, or periodical (FDAP) income,&lt;ref name="fdap" /&gt; and taxed at a 30% flat US rate, the wide range of exclusions&lt;ref name="exclusions" /&gt; means that in practice the US does not actually tax the most common types of US source interest that nonresident aliens receive, such as that paid by banks, savings and loan institutions, credit unions, and insurance companies.&lt;ref name="p519" /&gt;&lt;ref name="p515"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p515.pdf| title=Publication 515 - Withholding of Tax on Nonresident Aliens and Foreign Entities| publisher=IRS| accessdate=July 25, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that holding US treasuries can be a tax-efficient way for you to hold some US assets.&lt;ref name="tbills"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/Nonresident+aliens%3A+U.S.+estate+tax+on+treasury+bills.-a013922633| title=Nonresident aliens: U.S. estate tax on treasury bills| publisher=Free Online Library| accessdate=July 16, 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

US source interest that does not fall under an exception may be taxable to the US for a nonresident alien. Examples include interest effectively connected with operating a US trade or business, and broker interest on cash ''deposits'' held at US brokers. The standard rate is 30%. You may be able to lower or eliminate this if the country you live in has a tax treaty with the US.&lt;ref name="NRAwithholding"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/Individuals/International-Taxpayers/NRA-Withholding| title=NRA Withholding| publisher=IRS| accessdate=July 25, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NRAtables"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/tax-treaty-tables| title=Tax Treaty Tables| publisher=IRS| accessdate=May 27, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Are dividends taxable for a nonresident alien? ==
Yes. The US will withhold tax on the dividends US domiciled ETFs and US stocks pay to nonresident aliens.

Your broker will apply this withholding to dividends paid to you as an investor. Withholding does not apply to capital gains or to interest payments.&lt;ref name="p515" /&gt; A part of the dividend a US domiciled ETF pays you may be exempt from nonresident withholding; see [[#Short-term capital gain distributions paid as dividends|below]] for more. The standard rate is 30%. If the country you live in has a tax treaty with the US, submitting a W-8BEN form to your broker should reduce this rate (usually to 15%).&lt;ref name="NRAwithholding" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NRAtables" /&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;At the time of writing, the US maintains income tax treaties with Australia, Austria, Bangladesh, Barbados, Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, China, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Egypt, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Jamaica, Japan, Kazakhstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Mexico, Morocco, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Pakistan, Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sri Lanka, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Trinidad &amp; Tobago, Tunisia, Turkey, Ukraine, United Kingdom, and Venezuela.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;The US terminated its tax treaty with Hungary, effective 1st Jan 2024 for dividend withholding tax. For more, see: {{cite web| url=https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0872| title= United States’ Notification of Termination of 1979 Tax Convention with Hungary| publisher=US Treasury| date=July 15, 2022| accessdate=September 12, 2022}} Also: {{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/a-24-05.pdf| title=Announcement Regarding the Effective Date of Termination of the United States-Hungary Tax Treaty| publisher=US Treasury| date=December 29, 2023| accessdate=January 1, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from an exemption for some US source 'portfolio interest' income, also [[#Interest distributions paid as dividends|discussed below]], US withholding tax applies regardless of the actual assets that a US domiciled ETF itself holds.&lt;ref name="Fordham"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1697&amp;context=faculty_scholarship| title=Foreign Investors in U.S. Mutual Funds: The Trouble with Treaties, p. 487| publisher=Fordham| author=Jeffrey M. Colon| accessdate=May 26, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even if all of the ETF's assets are non-US stocks, the US will still take 30% or lower treaty rate in dividend tax. Holding the same assets in a non-US domiciled ETF eliminates this US tax overhead.

If you live in a country with poor or no US tax treaty coverage, you should ''strongly consider'' using [[Nonresident alien investors and Ireland domiciled ETFs|non-US domiciled ETFs]] instead of US domiciled ones, as a way to reduce or even eliminate the US tax you pay on dividends from funds holding stocks.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The countries with poor US income tax treaties, ones that provide a US dividend tax rate that is above the 15% US/Ireland tax treaty rate, are Greece, Pakistan, Trinidad and Tobago, India, Israel, Philippines, Tunisia, and Turkey.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Estimating tax withholding leakage ===
{{See also|Nonresident alien investors and Ireland domiciled ETFs#Estimating Level 1 dividend tax withholding paid by US domiciled funds|label 1=Estimating Level 1 dividend tax withholding paid by US domiciled funds}}

Other than the tax withholding that shows on your brokerage account's statement, the fund itself has taxes withheld on the dividends it receives. This is usually happens in funds that hold international equities. This withholding reduces the fund's return to investors, but it is mostly invisible unless you look at the annual reports. 

=== Short-term capital gain distributions paid as dividends ===
A US domiciled ETF that pays a short-term [[Capital gains distribution|capital gains distribution]] will generally include this as part of its dividend. For US investors this makes no difference to their tax or other positions.

However, the US does not tax nonresident aliens on their capital gains. In this case, an ETF should exempt the part of a dividend that is due to short-term capital gains from nonresident alien withholding. For this to occur correctly, the broker needs to be aware that the withholding rate on this payment to nonresidents is less than the standard or treaty rate.

=== Interest distributions paid as dividends ===
Where a US domiciled ETF receives ''US source'' interest on its holdings, and that interest would not have been taxable to a US nonresident if paid directly, the part of the dividend attributable to this interest is either exempt under the normal US tax rules, or it is 'portfolio interest'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/publications/p515#en_US_2020_publink1000224910| title=Publication 515, Withholding of Tax on Nonresident Aliens and Foreign Entities| publisher=IRS| accessdate=August 6, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both can be exempted from nonresident withholding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.klgates.com/permanent-us-withholding-tax-rules-for-non-us-investors-in-rics--a-new-distribution-opportunity-01-12-2016/| title=Permanent U.S. Withholding Tax Relief for Non-U.S. Investors in U.S. Mutual Funds| publisher=K&amp;L Gates| accessdate=May 23, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; This situation is unlikely in ETFs that hold only stocks, but will be common in bond ETFs, and any mixed-asset ETFs.

Again, for this to occur correctly both the ETF provider and the broker need to be aware of the relevant qualified interest income (QII) regulations.

This exemption is particularly narrow. It does not apply to any ''non-US source'' interest or dividends that the ETF receives.&lt;ref name="Fordham" /&gt; This means that a US domiciled ETF containing non-US bonds or non-US stocks suffers the standard 30% or lower treaty rate US tax on dividends. If you had instead held the ETF's assets either directly or through a non-US domiciled ETF, you would have paid no US tax.

Where these exemptions apply, it is relatively common for a fund or ETF provider, or a broker, to first withhold US tax, and then later on report this income on IRS form 1042-S as not US taxable. In this case, you will need to file a form 1040-NR with the IRS to recover the over-withholding.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;As of 2025, the IRS is known to be unable to correctly handle electronically filed 1040-NR forms in circumstances involving some types of form 1042-S. In these cases, you will need to file your 1040-NR return on paper. For more, see: {{Forum link| t=452124| title=Refund for tax withheld on tax-exempt interest-related dividends| author=bandersnatcher |date=March 23, 2025}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== TD Ameritrade tax withholding experiment ===
A test in 2015 using a TD Ameritrade account and a selection of US domiciled ETFs: MUB, BIV, LQD, BNDX, VIG, VTI and VXUS, shows that all had tax withheld at 30% from the dividends distributed, with the exception of MUB and VXUS.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The lack of US withholding tax on VXUS dividends seems to contradict the predictions. It was expected that the US would withhold dividend taxes on this US-domiciled fund. One possible explanation is that the dividend in question was actually payment of short-term capital gains. This type of dividend is exempt from US withholding when paid to a nonresident alien. Forum member "furion" confirms that at least one brokerage considers VXUS subject to US tax withholding, in {{forum link|p=2962760|title=Re: Question about a Bogle wiki article|date=2 Jul 2016}}, viewed 12 Apr 2020.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Also unexpected is that the LQD and BIV dividends were all withheld at 30%. These ETFs hold only bonds, and so their dividends should be all QII, making them exempt from nonresident withholding.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note&gt;BNDX holds only non-US bonds, and so will not benefit from the QII exemption.&lt;/ref&gt; MUB holds US municipal bonds, which are tax-exempt from US federal taxes. VXUS holds stocks of non-US companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/publications/p515/ar02.html#en_US_2015_publink1000224880| title=Publication 515, Income subject to withholding, Withholding of Tax on Nonresident Aliens| publisher=IRS| accessdate= April 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Is filing a US 1040-NR tax return necessary? ==
Generally, no. If your broker applies the correct US tax withholding for your home country (so 30% without a tax treaty, or the treaty rate if applicable), your US tax withholding will exactly match your US tax liability. In this case, and provided you have no other taxable US source income, the IRS does not require you to file a form 1040-NR nonresident alien US tax return.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-1040-nr| title=About Form 1040-NR, U.S. Nonresident Alien Income Tax Return| publisher=IRS| accessdate=February 13, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If you supply your broker with a form W-8BEN, this should ensure that they withhold the correct amount of US tax on your dividends.&lt;ref name="about_W-8BEN"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-w-8-ben| title=About Form W-8 BEN, Certificate of Status of Beneficial Owner for United States Tax Withholding and Reporting (Entities)| publisher=IRS| accessdate=January 12, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common case where US tax withholding is incorrect is where a broker withholds 30% rather than a lower treaty rate. This can occur if you have not provided a W-8BEN, it has expired, or the broker has ignored it. In this case, you can file a form 1040-NR with the IRS to recover the overwithholding. The IRS provides a special "simplified procedure"&lt;ref group=note&gt;The use of "simplified" here is a relative term. You should expect a long wait for any refund from the IRS. Also, if you do not have a US {{plain link| url=//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Security_number |name=Social Security number}} (SSN), you will need to first apply for a US {{plain link| url=//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individual_Taxpayer_Identification_Number| name=Individual Taxpayer Identification Number}} (ITIN).&lt;/ref&gt; for this.

== Are nonresident aliens at risk from US estate taxes? ==
Potentially, yes. Except for Canada, if you hold US domiciled ETFs or US stocks and your home country does not have a separate [https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/estate-gift-tax-treaties-international estate tax treaty] with the US, then on your death you risk becoming liable for US estate taxes.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;For a vivid firsthand account of the misery of dealing with US estate tax and the IRS as a nonresident alien, see {{Forum link| p=7934614| title=Do US brokerages demand an IRS Transfer Certificate before releasing funds from an estate?| date=June 30, 2024}}.&lt;/ref&gt; While the US has an extensive network of [https://www.irs.gov/businesses/international-businesses/united-states-income-tax-treaties-a-to-z income tax treaties], only a handful of countries have estate tax treaties with the US.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;At the time of writing, the US maintains estate tax treaties with Australia, Austria, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, South Africa, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.

Canada does not have a separate estate tax treaty with the US. Instead, the US maintains a single treaty with Canada that combines both income taxes and estate taxes.

Even where a treaty protects you from US estate tax, there are still hurdles and delays in accessing US domiciled holdings:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://international.schwab.com/public/file/P-6133620/US_Tax_Est_Disclosure_to_NonUS.pdf| publisher=Charles Schwab| title=U.S. Tax and Estate Disclosure to Non-U.S. Persons| accessdate=July 25, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A US estate tax treaty may protect you from US estate taxes up to or even beyond a level equivalent to that allowed to US citizens, but the presence of a US estate tax treaty does not guarantee that this is the case. In particular, the US estate tax treaties with Ireland and South Africa may not offer worthwhile protection from US estate taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.kplaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2025-United-States-Estate-and-Gift-Tax-An-Overview-for-Foreigners-Investing-in-the-United-States.pdf| title=United States Estate and Gift Tax - An Overview for Foreigners Investing in the United States| publisher=Kohnen &amp; Patton LLP| date=2025| accessdate=May 28, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt; If you are considering holding US domiciled ETFs and other US situated assets, you should check any applicable US estate tax treaty details ''very carefully'' before proceeding. Residency is not normally a sufficient condition for using a US estate tax treaty. This type of treaty is generally controlled by [[Domicile|domicile]], a legal concept that, although it includes residency as one of its components, is different and distinct from residency; citizenship may also be a factor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/147634389.pdf| title=Estate, Gift, and Generation-Skipping Transfer Tax Treaties| publisher=SMU Law Review| date=1983| accessdate=August 1, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

You may face local estate taxes as well, and in the absence of a US estate tax treaty this can cause double taxation. In addition, some US estate tax treaties do not provide for estate tax credits, and this may also cause double taxation.

Sometimes. Nonresident aliens do not face US gift tax on gifts of 'intangible property', such as most US domiciled ETFs&lt;ref group="note"&gt;US domiciled ETFs structured as US corporations are probably safe from US gift taxes, a consequence of the general exception for US stocks.

{{Warning|Master limited partnerships are intended for very experienced investors who understand both the risks involved and the incredibly complex taxation rules. Please ask in the [https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/index.php Bogleheads forum] for advice, as these securities are intended for high net worth individuals with the resources to manage these securities.}}

A '''master limited partnership''' (MLP) is a [[Wikipedia:limited partnership|limited partnership]] that is publicly traded on a securities exchange. It combines the tax benefits of a limited partnership with the liquidity of publicly traded securities.

The '''master limited partnership''' is actually a colloquial name for a subset of the group of entities called publicly traded partnerships (PTPs). PTPs issue publicly traded interests (called “units”) that are accessible to investors with a brokerage account.&lt;ref name="VG"&gt;{{cite web| author=David T. Kwon| url=https://advisors.vanguard.com/VGApp/iip/site/advisor/researchcommentary/article/IWE_InvResPrimerLtdPartnerships| title=User's guide to master limited partnerships| publisher=Vanguard Institutional| date=June 17, 2014}}{{dead link}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, PTPs are unincorporated entities under state law, like limited liability companies or limited partnerships, and are treated as partnerships for tax purposes. As partnerships, PTPs are able to pass through all income, gains, deductions, losses, and credits to investors, and they generally pay no entity-level taxes.&lt;ref name="VG" /&gt;

==Characteristics==
'''MLP units carry stock-like risk:''' The publicly traded units issued by MLPs —the predominant way investors gain exposure to them- represent the equity capital of a business, and as such, carry a level of risk similar to that of stock in a capital structure. In other words, MLP units are inherently riskier than bonds issued by the same company.&lt;ref name="VG" /&gt; 

'''MLPs are concentrated in the energy sector:''' Most MLPs are energy-related businesses. This is a result of tax-related legislation.&lt;ref name="VG" /&gt;

==Investing in MLPs==
There are two ways to invest in MLPs:

*'''Direct investment:''' Investors purchase units of one or more MLPs, thus becoming a partner in each business. A key advantage of direct investing is pass-through taxation. As partnerships, MLPs generally pay no corporate taxes; instead, they pass through net income and gains untaxed to investors, who then pay personal income tax on their share of these proceeds.&lt;ref name="VG" /&gt;
*'''Indirect investment:'''  Investing indirectly means gaining exposure to MLPs through investment vehicles that hold or track them. Such vehicles include closed-end funds, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and exchange-traded notes (ETNs). In addition to diversification, key advantages these vehicles provide are that they eliminate the need to deal with Schedule K-1s and do not generate [http://www.irs.gov/publications/p598/ch04.html Unrelated Business Taxable Income] (UBTI).&lt;ref name="VG" /&gt;

==Taxation==
MLPs require you to understand six tax topics:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/baldwin/2010/12/02/tax-guide-to-master-limited-partnerships/| title=Tax Guide To Master Limited Partnerships| publisher=Forbes| date=December 2, 2010| accessdate=September 17, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Flow-through accounting
#Tax basis
#Return of capital
#Passive loss rules
#Recapture
#Zero basis

An MLP's tax pass-through status applies at both a federal and a state level. An MLP unitholder is responsible for paying state income taxes on the portion of income allocated to the unitholder for each individual state in which the MLP operates. For companies that have networks of pipelines reaching across America, this can mean a considerable number of additional filings for the investor. In most cases, however, unless the unitholder owns a large position, the share of allocated income is small and the unitholder may not have to file in some states due to minimum income limits. Additionally, some states, such as Texas and Wyoming, do not have state income taxes.&lt;ref name="Alerian"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://etfdb.com/index-education/mlp-101/| title=MLP 101| publisher=VettaFi| accessdate=September 17, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If you are considering owning an MLP in a tax-advantaged account such as an IRA, partnership income (not cash distributions) may be considered unrelated business taxable income (UBTI) and subject to unrelated business income tax (UBIT), if UBIT exceeds $1,000 in a year. The custodian of the IRA is responsible for filing IRS Form 990T and paying the taxes.&lt;ref name="Alerian" /&gt;

==Overview==
This tax impact calculator works on the principle of the old cliché: a picture is worth a thousand words!

[[Image:IntroDiff.jpg|right]]This is an illustration of exactly what this article is all about.  The blue line illustrate the taxes paid when all of your income comes from ordinary sources.  The red line illustrates the taxes paid on the same income stream where $30,000 comes from Social Security, $6,000 comes from Long Term Capital Gains, and the rest from ordinary income sources.  The dotted green line is the purpose of this article.  It illustrates your tax savings and how, during retirement, those savings can grow in this case up to $4,642, then shrink back to only $1,725 as you give $2,917 back to the IRS as your initially tax free LTCG and Social Security slowly becomes taxable income.  If you know that you will have to give back the tax savings and when that will happen, maybe you can modify your investments and keep the savings.
	 
The interesting thing here is that your broker can’t talk to you about taxes and your tax accountant can’t talk to you about investments.  Neither one will show you this picture, it had to come from a computer geek on the Internet.  On top of all that, the computer geek is not “qualified” to give advice on either topic, but you can download the spreadsheet, enter your personal financial data and create the graph of your own personal “Marginal” tax rates then show that graph to your accountant and broker as a reference on the type of advice you need.  They are allowed to verify if the graph looks reasonable, they just can’t create it for you.

{{clear}}

==Marginal tax rates==
Your [[marginal tax rate]] is “The amount of tax paid on an additional dollar of income.”

Prior to retirement we are all familiar with the 10%, 15%, 25%, etc. tax rates that created the blue line in the first graph.

[[Image:MarginalRates.jpg|left]]We initially receive our Social Security and Long Term Capital Gains as tax free income and this is what pushed the initial taxation point of the red line well past the blue line.  The problem is that these income sources are not actually tax free, their taxation is merely delayed until your gross income sources reach higher levels and inflation is causing retirees to reach those higher levels earlier each year.

Once you start paying these delayed taxes, you pay them in parallel to your standard income tax rates which is what creates the higher marginal income tax rates.

The dotted green line in this second graph represents the 50% and 85% “taxability” levels of your Social Security benefits as defined by the 1983 and 1993 amendments to the original Social Security Act.  At the 50% level each dollar of additional income increases your taxable income by $1.50 and the 85% level increases your taxable income by $1.85.  This explains why most of the solid red marginal tax rate line is 50% higher then 85% higher than the dotted red standard IRS tax brackets.  The 55.5% Marginal Rate is created by the combination of the delayed taxation of your Long Term Gains, the dotted blue line, compounded by the 85% taxability of your Social Security benefits, you are basically paying parallel taxes on your parallel taxes.  The shape of the 55.5% and 46.25% Marginal Tax Brackets in this chart is why the spreadsheet is called The Hump.
{{clear}}
[[Image:ParallelTaxes.jpg|right]]Let’s look at these parallel taxes from a spreadsheet point of view.  

In the Green taxation lane you pay your normal federal tax rates on the additional income that you receive.  

In the Gold lane you first get your Social Security benefits as tax free income, then the 1983 and 1993 amendments to the Social Security act kick in so the additional income also makes a portion of your previously tax free Social Security benefit taxable and you pay your normal federal tax rates on the now taxable portion of your benefit in parallel to the taxes paid on the actual income you received.

In the Purple lane, as with your Social Security benefits, you initially get your Long Term Gains tax free, then as you approach the top of your 15% bracket the combined amount of your actual income plus the taxable Social Security pushes a portion of your long term gains into the 25% bracket where they are then taxed at a reduced rate of 15%.

The ratio between the actual total income and the total taxes paid in all three parallel tax lanes is what creates your Marginal Tax Rates.

==Setup==

The spreadsheet is already set up for the 2015 tax tables, personal exemptions and standard deductions. The yellow background numbers from the [setup] tab will automatically be transferred to each spreadsheet page to perform the various calculations necessary to create the graphs. 

In other tax years you need to update the tax tables from the appropriate IRS sources.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;See: [http://www.irs.com/articles/2015-federal-tax-rates-personal-exemptions-and-standard-deductions 2015 Federal Tax Rates, Personal Exemptions, and Standard Deductions IRS Tax Brackets and Deduction Amounts for Tax Year 2015], from the IRS.&lt;/ref&gt;  You also need to update the personal exemption and standard deduction data.  After updating these numbers click on the appropriate check boxes to indicate if you and /or your spouse is over the age of 65 (or blind).  The spreadsheet will calculate your appropriate standard deduction and again transfer the yellow background numbers to the spreadsheets.

There is another tab called [PIA]. Before using this tab you should contact Social Security to get your personal PIA (Primary Insurance Amount) for your normal retirement age (NRA).  You can then use the Social Security [http://www.ssa.gov/oact/quickcalc/early_late.html Early or Late Retirement] page to calculate the percentage of your benefit that you will get based on the month and year you plan to retire.  Use the table at the bottom of this page to calculate and save your benefit amounts for your various “What If” scenarios. 

You can then use the [Incomes] tab to itemize and sum up the remaining 5 income fields you will need.

Once all of this information is available you are ready to start creating your personalized Marginal Tax Rate graphs and What If tax savings charts.
{{clear}}

==A first look==

After you download the spreadsheet you can fill in your own private income information to create a graph of what your personal marginal tax brackets will be.  Just choose the [Single] or [Married] tab based on your filing status.

[[Image:Single63K.jpg|left]]You only have to fill in the 6 yellow cells in the upper left corner of the spreadsheet to create a chart based on your retirement tax situation.  The shape of the red line will be determined by your personal Social Security Benefits and your Long Term Gain income.  The orange tick mark will show you the relationship between your gross taxable income level and your marginal tax rates.
The numbers used on this graph were chosen specifically to represent an upper middle class individual whose gross income of $63,000 places them just at the start of The Hump marginal tax rates.

The COLA (Cost-of-Living Adjustment) cell is a very important feature of the spreadsheet.  It allows you to estimate your potential tax situation as the cost of living changes.  The actual marginal rates are not based on the values you entered at the top of the graph, they are based on the values at the bottom of the graph that have been adjusted by the COLA rate.  The tax brackets, exemptions and standard deductions are also modified by the same COLA value.
COLA was originally designed to allow you to look a few years into the future, but negative values also allow you to look into the past and this can reveal a something very important, your personal tax situation will most likely get worse with inflation.
{{clear}}

==Historical Impact==

The COLA entry was designed to let you look into the future to see what will happen when the cost of living goes up, but it can also be used to give rough estimates of historical representations of the system.  The Social Security Administration publishes a list of yearly Index Factors that can be used to convert historical dollars into today’s dollars.  The index factor for 1983, the year that the first Social Security taxability amendment was passed, is 3.05.  Using this Index Factor in reverse, a COLA factor of -67% can be used to change today’s dollars into 1983 dollars.
{|
|+ '''1983'''
|-
||[[File:Hump1983.jpg]]
|}
 
Note how the orange income values are now 33% of today’s incomes.  Also note that the adjusted orange Upper Middle Class gross income tick mark in 1983 is considerably less than the start of the 50% taxation point created in 1983 which is represented by the dotted green line.
{|
|+ '''1993'''
|-
||[[File:Hump1993.jpg]]
|}
 
Ten years later when the 85% taxation bracket was added by the 1993 amendment the index factor was now 2.01, an inflationary increase of about 33% over the 1983 value, but since the $25,000 taxability point for the 50% level did not change, an Upper Middle Class income was now close to making a portion of your Social Security benefit taxable.
{|
|+ '''2008'''
|-
||[[File:Hump2008.jpg]]
|}
 
World War II ended in Europe on May 8, 1945 which caused the baby boom generation to start in 1946.  Those born in 1946 reached their early Social Security retirement age of 62 in 2008.  The index factor for 2008 was 1.12 making the COLA adjustment about -10%.  The base $63,000 Middle Class Income we are using is now well into the 85% taxability bracket and nearly into the hump.
{|
|+ '''2020'''
|-
||[[File:Hump2020.jpg]]
|}
 
Using the COLA factor for its original intent, looking into the future, we see that the base Upper Middle Class income has now moved into the hump area.
Basically we have to plan to avoid the hump area by a reasonable margin so that inflation does not push us up against its proverbial brick wall for our standard of living during retirement.

Looking at the previous graphs you can see that the increases in your social security benefits push the start taxation points for those benefits to a higher dollar value while the gross income tick mark moves up faster because the start taxation point is a fixed value while the gross income is adjusted for inflation.  The [Historical] tab on the spreadsheet gives you a more detailed example of how this happens.
{{clear}}

==What if==

The spreadsheet also contains a pair of “What If” tabs, [Singles] and [Marrieds], which allow you to enter two sets of income values so you can compare the results.
 
[[Image:Wait2Years.jpg|right]]This is a married couple who wants to have a $100,000 after tax income during retirement.  Their current situation, the dark red line with the tallest orange tick mark, indicates they will be right at the start of their “Tax Hump”.  Their second option is to work part time and delay taking their Social Security benefits for two additional years.  This situation is represented by the lighter orange line and the tall red tick mark.  If they wait they will get more tax delayed income which will allow them to take more than $10,000 less out of their 401K accounts each year while staying a reasonable distance away from their new Tax Hump.

Note that their tax hump is bigger because their Social Security is higher but the higher Social Security also pushed the start of their Tax Hump further down their gross income stream.  Note also that their effective tax rate is considerably lower.
A special note here:  The [Singles] tab has a third line above the graph that is the sum of the two yellow lines.  This is designed so the tab can be used to compare the What If situation for a single individual and also used by a non-married couple who is planning to share expenses during retirement.

{|

==Cost of money==

[[Image:CostOf6K.jpg|right]]What if your friends come to you with the idea of taking a cruise together each winter?  You will need an extra $6,000 of after tax money, how will you get it?
 
Your current retirement situation puts you right up against your personal tax hump.  The Cost Of money column lets you know that the cost of $6,000 of after tax spendable money will be $11,427 at a marginal tax bracket of 47.49%.  The small red tick marks also let you know that you will be over the hump and back in the 25% tax bracket after paying for just one cruise.  A second cruise will now only cost you $8,000 at the 25% bracket.

If you do not have a picture of what is happening you will probably not withhold enough taxes and have a huge tax bill the following April, after all, your effective tax rate so far has only been 6.8%.  Without the picture why would it be 47.49% now?  You might also do the proper calculation for this year only and start paying $11,427 each year for each cruise.  If you do have this picture you can see that additional cruises will only cost $8,000, a $3,427 savings for each additional year.

==Roth IRA conversions==

A [[Roth IRA]] account is an excellent source of non-taxable income during retirement.  Your money grows tax free and dollars taken from a Roth during retirement do not cause the taxable portion of your Socials Security to increase.  Unfortunately your annual contributions to a Roth account are limited to $5,500 before the age of 50 and $6,500 after the age of 50.  One way around these limitations is the [[Roth IRA conversion]].  You are allowed to convert Traditional IRA holdings into a Roth IRA account if you pay the taxes on the amount that you convert.  If you take your taxes out of the funds you transfer:

* If your pre-retirement and retirement tax rates are the same the ending after tax dollars are the same, you are just paying your taxes today instead of when you withdraw the money.
* If you can convert the funds at 25% today to avoid the 27.75% marginal bracket in retirement, 15% at the 85% taxation level, your financial gain will be 2.75%.
* If you can convert funds at 25% or 28% today to avoid the 46.25% or 55.5% marginal brackets in retirement your financial gains will be substantial.

{|
|+ '''Roth IRA Conversion'''
|-
||[[File:TheHump-ROTH.jpg]]
|}

And if you can pay the tax out of non-retirement accounts, the conversion would be more advantageous.

What if you are already retired and stuck in a situation where you will be over The Hump each year or just for an unexpected expense this year? That also means that you are back to the 25% and then 28% standard tax brackets. You could do a very large conversion of a portion of your Traditional IRA to Roth at those lower brackets so that you could replace a portion of your taxable income with non-taxable income in future years. Just remember that there are penalties involved if you use the converted funds within 5 years of the conversion. Plan ahead! If you need $7,000 a year to feel comfortable then you should do your conversion every time your Roth account gets down to $35,000 so that you have $7,000 a year for 5 years before you need to use the newly converted money.

{{clear}}

==The marriage penalty==
[[Image:MarriagePenalty.jpg|right]]
The 1983 Social Security Amendment set the start of the 50% taxability of your benefits at $25,000 for a single individual and $32,000 for a married couple.

The 1993 Social Security Amendment set the start of the 85% taxability of your benefits at $34,000 for a single individual and $44,000 for a married couple.

Since the married couple’s start points are less than double the single individual’s start points their combined Social Security Benefits become taxable earlier.  In the long run they will not pay more tax, but they do pay their taxes earlier which is a penalty to them at certain income levels.

The [Compare] tab of the spreadsheet allows you to enter the income levels for a single individual.  It will then double those amount for the married couple and plot both marginal tax lines on a per capita scale.
 
{{clear}}

==Adjusting your income sources==

[[Image:Married63x2at10k.jpg|left]]If the married couple in the previous example was not aware of their choices they would just continue to pay an extra $5,090 more in taxes each year than their single friends living next door sharing retirement expenses.  If they knew about this situation before retirement they could have planned to move some of their retirement income to non-taxable sources like a Roth account.

In this example they were able to find a $7,500 annual source of non-taxable income which allowed them to reduce their traditional IRA withdraws by $13,750 and reduce their taxes by $6,249 while keeping their after tax income constant.

The creation of $7,500 would have cost them $10,000 at the 25% level and $10,417 at the 28% level prior to retirement.  This is a huge improvement over the $13,750 cost during retirement for the same after tax income level.

Just remember that you have a 5 year waiting period before you can withdraw newly converted Roth funds without paying a penalty.

Keeping in mind that this article is not being written by a financial advisor or tax accountant, there many other ways to create relatively tax free income during retirement.  You might be able to take a portion of your pension as a lump sum.  You might consider a reverse mortgage.
{{clear}}

==Conclusion==

The important thing to take from this article is that ''The Hump'' exists and it is very important for you to understand your current or eventual retirement income situation as it relates to ''The Hump''.  The earlier you start planning to avoid it, the better off you will be in retirement.

'''Passive Foreign Investment Companies''' (PFICs) are investment vehicles classified under U.S. Code: Title 26 - Internal Revenue Code,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26|title=U.S. Code: Title 26 - Internal Revenue Code|publisher=Cornell University Law School|accessdate=January 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[Mutual fund|mutual funds]], [[Exchange-traded fund|exchange-traded funds]] (ETFs), and [[Real estate investment trust| Real Estate Investment Trusts]] (REITs), which are not registered with the US Securities Exchange Commission (SEC). Under the U.S. Code,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/1297|title=26 U.S. Code § 1297 - Passive foreign investment company| publisher=Cornell University Law School| accessdate=January 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the term "passive foreign investment company" means any foreign corporation if—
# 75 percent or more of the gross income of such corporation for the taxable year is passive income, or
# The average percentage of assets (as determined in accordance with subsection (e)) held by such corporation during the taxable year which produce passive income or which are held for the production of passive income is at least 50 percent.

Most sources maintain that this definition captures nearly all funds and ETFs commonly used by investors in countries other than the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://hodgen.com/what-is-a-pfic/|title=What is a PFIC?|publisher=Hodgen Law PC| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231201190432/https://hodgen.com/what-is-a-pfic/| archive-date=December 1, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note&gt;Practically every non-US domiciled fund and ETF will be a US PFIC. As a quick way to tell, if it has 'UCITS' somewhere in its name, it is European domiciled and so a PFIC. Aside from reading its prospectus, KID, or fund documents, the other unambiguous way you can tell is to find its ISIN. If the first two letters are not 'US', it is almost certainly a US PFIC for tax purposes. Most UCITS funds are domiciled in either Ireland, with ISIN code 'IE', or Luxembourg, with ISIN code 'LU'.&lt;/ref&gt; This would make these funds a potential tax trap for US citizens living abroad, and also for non-US citizens living temporarily in the US as well as US permanent residents.&lt;ref group="note&gt;For example, all European UCITS funds and ETFs, issued by Vanguard, BlackRock and others and traded on major European exchanges will be US PFICs.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the taxation on these funds under US law can be extremely unfavorable, and is described as having the ability to "potentially consume most of the return on investment,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://creativeplanning.com/international/insights/americans-should-avoid-non-us-mutual-funds/|title=Americans Should Avoid Owning Shares in a Non-U.S. Mutual Fund|last=Healy | first=Roger| date=2022 |publisher= Creative Planning | accessdate=June 11, 2023| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230401051301/https://creativeplanning.com/international/insights/americans-should-avoid-non-us-mutual-funds/| archive-date=April 1, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; there is flexibility in the taxation method that may be useful in some circumstances.

==IRS filing overview==

If you hold any PFICs you have to file IRS [https://www.irs.gov/uac/form-8621-return-by-a-shareholder-of-a-passive-foreign-investment-company-or-qualified-electing-fund Form 8621] (Information Return by a Shareholder of a Passive Foreign Investment Company or Qualified Electing Fund) with your tax return. This can be an ''extremely'' time consuming task,&lt;ref name="form8621_instructions"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/instructions/i8621| title=Instructions for Form 8621| publisher=IRS| accessdate=July 25, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly if many investments are involved, because each holding needs a separately completed copy of Form 8621.

==Form 8621 filing options==

Form 8621 instructions&lt;ref name="form8621_instructions" /&gt; give you a choice of three different ways to treat PFICs:
# Section 1291 taxation, which generates an interest liability on tax deferral&lt;ref name="Section 1291"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/1291| title=26 U.S. Code § 1291 - Interest on tax deferral| publisher=Cornell University Law School| accessdate=August 14, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# A mark to market election, which generates annual tax on unrealized gains, based on the current fund value&lt;ref group="note"&gt;"Mark to market" means that a security is based on its current market value. See: [https://www.nasdaq.com/investing/glossary/m/mark-to-market-accounting Mark-to-Market accounting], from NASDAQ.com.&lt;/ref&gt;
# A Qualified Electing Fund (QEF) election, the least bad option, but potentially difficult to achieve

If you do not make a choice on a ''timely filed'' (including extensions) tax return for the year that you make the investment, the default treatment is ''Section 1291 taxation'', and it is valid for this and all future years. The only way to change this is to "purge" the PFIC.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;You file a ''purging election'' with IRS [https://www.irs.gov/uac/about-form-8621a Form 8621-A], Return by a Shareholder Making Certain Late Elections to End Treatment as a Passive Foreign Investment Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Section 1291 taxation===

Section 1291 of the US Code is the tax rule which generates particularly unfavorable treatment.&lt;ref name="Section 1291" /&gt; It taxes "ordinary" distributions as dividends. Any distribution which is more than 125% of the average for the previous three years is considered an "excess" distribution, as is any gain received on the sale. Excess distributions are treated as if they were prorated over the entire holding period, and for previous years it is taxed at the ''maximum personal tax rate for that year'', not your personal rate, plus interest at the normal rate on tax underpayments. You cannot deduct losses against the excess distributions on sales with gains; they would be deducted only as regular capital losses.

Because of the interest, your effective tax rate on the gain from a long-term holding could reach or even exceed 100%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| publisher=Wikipedia| url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_foreign_investment_company#Effect_of_PFIC_status| title=Passive foreign investment company § Effect of PFIC status| accessdate=April 8, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mark to market===

For mark to market, the investment needs to be marketable and on a qualified exchange.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;A qualified exchange is: "''... (i) a national securities exchange which is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission or the national market system established pursuant to section 11A of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, or (ii) any exchange or other market which the Secretary determines has rules adequate to carry out the purposes of this part.''" See: {{cite web| url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/1296| title=26 U.S. Code § 1296 - Election of mark to market for marketable stock| publisher=Cornell Law School| accessdate=July 25, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Presumably this includes all major stock exchanges.) Each year your gains - ''whether realized or unrealized'' - are treated as ordinary income; losses up to the value of accumulated gains are also ordinary income (losses). You cannot claim losses greater than the gains in that tax year, but they will reduce gains in future years.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;For a comprehensive example, see: {{cite web| url=https://forums.serbinski.com/viewtopic.php?t=8250| title=Form 8621 Unreversed Inclusions| publisher=Serbinski Accounting Firms Forum| date=March 8, 2014| accessdate=December 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To say this another way, the value of the fund at the end of the year determines your taxable gain or loss. By simply holding the fund, you are taxed on the unrealized gain.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;An unrealized gain is an increase in value of a security. It is not "real" because the security has not been sold. When the security is sold, the gain becomes "real" and is known as a ''realized'' gain. See: [https://www.nasdaq.com/investing/glossary/u/unrealized-capital-gain-loss Unrealized capital gain/loss], from NASDAQ.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, if you hold a PFIC, you suffer two major tax disadvantages in comparison with the typical mutual fund holder in SEC-registered funds held outside a tax-advantaged account:

# Ordinary income tax treatment, rather than capital gains tax treatment; and
# Tax each year on ''unrealized'' capital gains inside the fund

You need to account for and report each block of shares purchased at a different time separately – "This becomes tedious and overwhelming when the fund reinvests dividends monthly to purchase more shares,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://form8621.com/pfic-taxation/mark-to-market/| title=Form 8621 Calculator - PFIC Mark to Market Taxation| publisher=Form 8621 Calculator| accessdate=June 15, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt; but for many buy and hold strategies this would not involve significant record keeping. ''Mark to market therefore taxes you at your rate of ordinary income, rather than at the rates of capital gains and dividends (which are often, but not always, lower).''

If you live and work in a high tax country (for example, a large part of Western Europe), a higher rate of local tax on investment income (including capital gains tax) may provide enough US foreign tax credits to cover a large investment gain without any US taxes. This can sometimes give you an advantage: if you leave this country and return to the US, you can immediately sell this investment with no capital gain, as the gains have already been marked to market.

===Qualified Electing Fund===

In many cases, a Qualified Electing Fund is the best option. From the IRS:&lt;ref name="form8621_instructions" /&gt;
{{blockquote|
*A shareholder of a QEF must annually include in gross income as ordinary income its pro rata share of the ordinary earnings and as long-term capital gain its pro rata share of the net capital gain of the QEF.
*The shareholder may elect to extend the time for payment of tax on its share of the undistributed earnings of the QEF (Election B) until the QEF election is terminated.
&lt;nowiki /&gt;|IRS Form 8621 Instructions}}

However, you must pay interest to the IRS if you elect to extend the time for payment. 

The QEF approach is basically the same as how the IRS taxes US mutual funds. In order to follow the QEF method, you need to provide information similar to a mutual fund 1099 form. The best way is for the foreign fund to produce this information (typically in what is called a "PFIC Annual Information Statement"). Many Canadian funds do this, but as of 2022 there appear to be no examples of European based funds providing this information. If you can gather the proper information, this would be acceptable, but perhaps difficult to accomplish in practice. 

Until European funds provide these PFIC statements, mark to market might often be preferable if you live in in Europe -- especially given the differential on tax rates in many European countries.

Mark to market will usually also be preferable for non-US citizens living in the US, perhaps temporarily, and who still hold non-US domiciled funds from before they became US residents.

==Exceptions for certain types of account==
===US pensions===

The PFIC tax rules do not apply to PFIC stocks held in a few US tax-deferred account types, primarily [[IRA|IRAs]] and [[401k|401ks]]. From IRS Notice 2014-28:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/irb/2014-18_IRB#NOT-2014-28| title=Internal Revenue Bulletin: 2014-18| publisher=IRS| accessdate=November 26, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{blockquote|For example, applying the PFIC rules to a U.S. person that is treated as a shareholder of a PFIC through the U.S. person’s ownership of an individual retirement account (IRA) described in section 408(a) that owns stock of a PFIC would be inconsistent with the principle of deferred taxation provided by IRAs. Accordingly, the Treasury Department and the IRS will amend the definition of shareholder in the section 1291 regulations to provide that a U.S. person that owns stock of a PFIC through a tax exempt organization or account (as described in § 1.1298–1T(c)(1)) is not treated as a shareholder of the PFIC.|IRS Notice 2014–28}}
And from Form 8621 instructions:&lt;ref name="form8621_instructions" /&gt;
{{blockquote|text=However, a U.S. person that owns stock of a PFIC through a tax-exempt organization or account described in the list below is not treated as a shareholder of the PFIC.
* An organization or an account that is exempt from tax under section 501(a) because it is described in section 501(c), 501(d), or 401(a).
* A state college or university described in section 511(a)(2)(B).
* A plan described in section 403(b) or 457(b).
* An individual retirement plan or annuity as defined in section 7701(a)(37).
* A qualified tuition program described in section 529 or 530.
* A qualified ABLE program described in section 529A.

This exception is narrow. It only includes non-US pensions that are covered by treaty, but many treaties do not cover pensions. In addition, although you might be able to use some non-US accounts as, in effect, a retirement savings account, any non-US accounts that are not explicitly ''pension funds'' under the treaty definition are ''not'' exempt from PFIC reporting. Examples include UK [[UK Individual Savings Accounts|Individual Savings Accounts]] (ISA), Canadian [[finiki:Tax-Free Savings Account|Tax-Free Savings Accounts]] (TFSA), and French [[Wikipedia:fr:Assurance-vie en France|Assurance-vie]] and [[Wikipedia:fr:Plan d'Épargne en Actions|Plan d'Épargne en Actions]] accounts.

==Summary==
===For US citizens living abroad===

Because of obstructive US tax rules, you cannot simply invest in local funds as you would in the US. You need to find the best solution for your personal situation.

One option is to invest in local funds while electing the mark to market or QEF option. Otherwise, you can only avoid PFIC problems  by investing through SEC-registered investment vehicles (which may in turn incur tax problems with the local tax authorities), or else through individual [[Stock basics|stocks]] and [[Bond basics|bonds]].

For a discussion of how to invest using individual stocks, see the Wiki page on [[Passively managing individual stocks|passively managing individual stocks]].

===For US residents===

People who immigrate or relocate to the US often still hold funds in their previous country of residence. They may make investments into funds in those countries even after becoming US residents. Or, they may inherit or be gifted funds by friends or relatives still living in those countries. These will almost certainly be PFICs, making them subject to all of the US tax difficulties outlined above.

If this is you, your usual best course of action is to sell these holdings as soon as possible. Ideally, you should sell them well before you move to the US, or before you inherit them or receive them as a gift,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| publisher=Hodgen Law PC| url=https://hodgen.com/what-is-the-heirs-basis-in-a-pfic-inherited-from-a-nra/| title=What is the heir’s basis in a PFIC inherited from a NRA?| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231201190000/https://hodgen.com/what-is-the-heirs-basis-in-a-pfic-inherited-from-a-nra/| archive-date=December 1, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; to avoid all interactions with the PFIC tax rules. Otherwise, or if selling is not an option, the mark to market rules will generally be your least bad choice, because few if any funds will provide the information required for QEF.

== Appendix - Legal issues and questions ==
{{Original research|section|reason=The conclusions reached here do not appear widely in other analyses of the PFIC rules. It is an interpretive position not yet addressed either by the IRS or by US courts. '''It applies only to narrow cases. In practice, most non-US funds are PFICs.'''}}
There is commentary suggesting that some Canadian mutual funds and ETFs may not necessarily be PFICs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://polaristax.com/certain-canadian-mutual-funds-arent-pfics/| title=Certain Canadian mutual funds aren’t PFICs | publisher=Polaris Tax Counsel| date=Apr 16, 2015| accessdate=May 18, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.waretax.com/canadian-etfs-and-mutual-funds-are-not-pfics/| title=Canadian ETF’s and Mutual Funds Are Not PFIC’s| publisher=WareTax PC| accessdate=May 18, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result requires analyzing whether the foreign "entity" (that is, the ETF or mutual fund) meets the definition of "corporation" in the Internal Revenue Code [IRC] or the Code of Federal Regulations [CFR]. In the case of Canadian funds, if national or provincial law imposes an element of personal liability on fund investors, this could prevent the application of rules classifying the fund as a "corporation" in US tax law,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=26 CFR § 301.7701-3 - Classification of certain business entities|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/26/301.7701-3|accessdate=May 18, 2025|publisher=Cornell Law School: Legal Information Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; which would mean these ETFs or mutual funds are not US PFICs.

US tax laws contain multiple traps for unwary '''investors based outside the US''' and for '''non-US citizens living in the US'''. US nonresident aliens, US citizens or green card holders living outside the US, and non-US citizens living temporarily in the US are all at risk. In the worst cases these traps can lead to outcomes such as US tax rates of 100% on gains,&lt;ref name=pfic100&gt;{{cite web| publisher=Wikipedia| url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_foreign_investment_company#Effect_of_PFIC_status| title=Passive foreign investment company § Effect of PFIC status| accessdate=March 17, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; loss of 40% of total assets&lt;ref name=nra40&gt;{{cite web| publisher=Wikipedia| url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estate_tax_in_the_United_States#Non-residents| title=Estate tax in the United states § Non-residents| accessdate=March 17, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; to US [[wikipedia:Estate_tax_in_the_United_States#Non-residents|estate taxes]], and huge fines for non-disclosure of assets.&lt;ref name=fbar&gt;{{cite web| publisher=IRS| url=https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/report-of-foreign-bank-and-financial-accounts-fbar| title=Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts (FBAR)| accessdate=March 17, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fatca&gt;{{cite web| publisher=IRS| url=https://www.irs.gov/businesses/corporations/summary-of-fatca-reporting-for-us-taxpayers| title=Summary of FATCA Reporting for U.S. Taxpayers| accessdate=March 17, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' offers guidelines for investors based outside the US and who plan to use [[wikipedia:Index_fund|index funds]] or [[wikipedia:Exchange-traded_fund|exchange-traded funds]] (ETFs), to help them avoid falling into US tax traps by navigating around, through, or between them. It also outlines some of the investing issues that arise from moving either in to or out of the US, to help people who are (or plan to become) non-US citizens living in the US, and US citizens or green card holders living outside the US, avoid the worst of the US tax traps that come from starting or ending US tax residence.

== Introduction ==

{{Notice|This guide is not, and can never be, entirely complete and unambiguous. While it will give you the broad outline of common US tax traps, there are often exceptions that change the outcome for a particular case. So after following it, take care to investigate your own individual circumstances carefully to make sure that it really applies to you as expected.}}

US tax laws are extensive,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| publisher=Wikipedia| url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxation_in_the_United_States| title=Taxation in the United States| accessdate=March 17, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; intrusive, complicated,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| publisher=Wikipedia| url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_tax_in_the_United_States#The_complexity_of_the_U.S._income_tax_laws| title=Income tax in the United States § The complexity of the U.S. income tax laws| accessdate=March 17, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; and far-reaching,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| publisher=Wikipedia| url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterritorial_jurisdiction#Economic_law| title=Extraterritorial jurisdiction § Economic law| accessdate=March 17, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; for both US investors and [[Domicile|non-US investors]].

In common with many countries, the US taxes the worldwide income of its residents. However, it is [[wikipedia:International_taxation#Citizenship|virtually unique]] in taxing the ''foreign'' income of its citizens and lawful permanent residents who live outside the country either temporarily or permanently.

It also applies onerous estate taxes&lt;ref name="jpm"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.jpmfinancialservices.com/images/PDFs/EstateTaxation.pdf| publisher=JPM Financial Services| title=Estate taxation of a nonresident alien| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221215091006/http://www.jpmfinancialservices.com/images/PDFs/EstateTaxation.pdf| archive-date=December 15, 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt; to US situated assets held by non-US persons (that is, non-US citizens who are also not US residents, referred to in IRS documents and US tax laws and regulations as 'nonresident aliens').

Investors at risk of hidden US tax traps fall into three main categories:
* Nonresident aliens living outside the US and holding US investments or assets
* US citizens and green card holders living outside the US
* Non-US citizens living in the US on a nonimmigrant work visa (such as H-1B or L-1) or a green card
All three groups face significant difficulties with US taxes. If you fall into one of these groups, following the guidelines below should help you to avoid the worst of the issues presented by US taxes.

== Why fund domicile matters ==
{{See also|Domicile#Domicile of a fund|label 1=Domicile § Domicile of a fund}}

Just like a person, a fund or ETF has a [[wikipedia:Domicile_(law)|domicile]]. This is the country in which the fund's holding company is legally incorporated, and typically where the administration and management of the fund itself takes place.

For example, [[The Vanguard Group|Vanguard]] offers two separate [[S&amp;P 500 index]] tracker ETFs, and they have different domiciles:
* VOO, from Vanguard US, domiciled in the US and traded on US exchanges
* VUSD, from Vanguard in Europe, domiciled in Ireland and traded on the ''London Stock Exchange'' and other European exchanges
Both of these ETFs hold the same underlying stocks, and so their returns should be the exact same (excluding perhaps a tiny offset due to any small difference in annual charges). So why do Vanguard do this? Surely someone could choose either at will and get the same results?

The answer is US taxes. Despite investing in identical underlying assets — that is, not just asset ''class'', but ''actual assets'' — people in varying personal 'tax circumstances' will get different results depending on which of these two ETFs they choose to hold. Sometimes wildly different.

For a ''US resident'', ''US citizen'' or ''green card holder'' investing in the S&amp;P 500 through VOO, the US will not withhold any tax on dividends, and the person themselves is responsible for their own tax payments to the US. If they invested in the S&amp;P 500 through VUSD instead, the US would apply a punitive 'offshore fund' tax regime on their ETF returns that in some cases could reduce the overall gain to nothing.&lt;ref name=pfic100 /&gt;

For a ''nonresident alien'' or ''non-US person'' investing in the S&amp;P 500 through VOO, the US will withhold up to 30% tax on dividends (the actual rate might be reduced by a tax treaty, typically to 15%), and will apply an estate tax of between 26% to 40% on the balance on the holder's death&lt;ref name=kma&gt;{{cite web| url=http://kmatzlaw.com/yahoo_site_admin/assets/docs/US_and_Gift_Taxation_of_Nonresident_Aliens_Updated.22862210.pdf| title=U.S. Estate and Gift Taxation of Nonresident Aliens| publisher=Kevin Matz &amp; Associates PLLC| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211021040840/http://kmatzlaw.com/yahoo_site_admin/assets/docs/US_and_Gift_Taxation_of_Nonresident_Aliens_Updated.22862210.pdf| archive-date=October 21, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nra40 /&gt; (again, depending on treaty). If they invested in the S&amp;P 500 through VUSD instead, the fund pays 15% internally&lt;ref name=dilloneustance&gt;{{cite web| publisher=Dillon Eustace| url=https://www.dilloneustace.com/uploads/files/Taxation-of-Collective-Investment-Funds-and-Availability-of-Treaty-Benefits.pdf| title=Taxation of Collective Investment Funds and Availability of Treaty Benefits| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230626213946/https://www.dilloneustace.com/uploads/files/Taxation-of-Collective-Investment-Funds-and-Availability-of-Treaty-Benefits.pdf| archive-date=June 26, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the US on dividends but the investor receives all of the remaining 85%, and there is no risk of US or Irish estate tax.

Where an ETF holds no US stocks, the US tax treatment is the same as shown above. For ''nonresident aliens'', this creates an even greater advantage for ETFs domiciled in Ireland over those domiciled in the US. The US dividend tax for a ''nonresident alien'' investing through a US domiciled ETF holding non-US stocks is again 30% (or lower, if there is a treaty), and with a risk of 26% to 40% US estate tax on the balance (depending on treaty).&lt;ref name=kma /&gt; For an Ireland domiciled ETF with identical holdings the US dividend tax loss is 0%, so that the investor receives the full 100% of dividends, and with no risk of US or Irish estate tax.&lt;ref name=dilloneustance /&gt;

For all of the above cases, whether or not the investments are held inside a pension or other tax-mitigating wrapper may create further significant differences to the tax results. For people who have or plan an international lifestyle, moving into or out of the US can create large and damaging discontinuities in tax treatment.

Between the extremes there is a range of outcomes. For non-US investors, the [[#Decision flowchart|decision flowchart]] below aims to help you uncover where you are in this range, as a way to guide you on whether to hold your investments through the usual Vanguard ETFs that US investors discuss and use, or whether to hold them through different ETFs — specifically, non-US domiciled ones. For people with an international lifestyle and who are currently or who may become US ''tax residents'', or who plan to end US residency, it aims to help you avoid multiple US tax traps.

{{Notice|This process only covers funds or ETFs. It is a guide to deciding which are the best fund and ETF domiciles for you to use, which are the worst, and any special issues relating to pensions and similar tax-mitigating wrappers. It does not cover real estate, US individual company shares, or any other investments.}}

== Interview section ==

[[File:NonUS flowchart.png|thumb|Figure 1. Flowchart|link=Special:Redirect/file/NonUS flowchart.png]]
[[Media:NonUS flowchart.png|Figure 1]] shows a flowchart for navigating around US tax traps.

=== Start ===

Navigate the flowchart by answering a series of questions and then following the links that apply to you until you reach a result. Most questions have simple '''yes'''/'''no''' answers.

Often you will need to read external documents to decide which answer to a question is the right one for you. But if you follow it, this flowchart should help you to determine how best to invest in index funds or ETFs while minimising US tax difficulties.

The results of this process are guidelines, not rigid rules. Local factors or conditions may mean that even though it suggests that you use one ETF domicile, it is better somehow, perhaps for reasons of liquidity, spread, or practical access to ETFs, to use another. If this is the case for you, after following it you will at least know the potential pitfalls of your decisions.

Go to [[#Q1|Question 1]] to begin.

{{Anchor|Q1}}
=== Q1. Are you a US citizen? ===

If '''yes''', go to [[#Q3|Question 3]]. If '''no''', go to [[#Q2|Question 2]].

{| class="wikitable"
|You are a US citizen by [[wikipedia:Citizenship_of_the_United_States#Birthright_citizenship|birthright]] if you were born in the US or born outside the US to one or more US citizen parents. If not a citizen by birthright, you can become one through a process of [[wikipedia:Citizenship_of_the_United_States#Naturalized_citizenship|naturalization]].

:'''Warning''': Under birthright citizenship it is entirely possible for the US to consider a person who left the US as a baby or small child, or who has perhaps never set foot in the US at all, to still be a US taxable person.&lt;ref name=accidentalamerican&gt;{{cite web| publisher=Wikipedia| url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accidental_American#Taxation_of_non-residents| title=Accidental American § Taxation of non-residents| accessdate=March 17, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once you are a US citizen the only way you can lose this status is by [[wikipedia:Citizenship_of_the_United_States#Renunciation_of_citizenship|renouncing]] your US citizenship at a US consulate. To do this you would generally need to have another citizenship besides US.

:'''Warning''': The process of renouncing US citizenship can have damaging US tax consequences, under the US's [[US tax pitfalls for a US person living abroad#Expatriation tax|expatriation tax]] regime.
|}

{{Anchor|Q2}}
=== Q2. Are you a green card holder (US lawful permanent resident)? ===

If '''yes''', go to [[#Q3|Question 3]]. If '''no''', go to [[#Q3b|Question 3b]].

{| class="wikitable"
|You have the status of US lawful permanent resident if you are authorised to live and work in the US by holding a [[wikipedia:Permanent_residence_(United_States)|green card]]. If you are in any doubt about your green card status you can use the [[wikipedia:Green_Card_Test|green card test]] to determine it.

:'''Warning''': Even if you hold an old and expired green card, unless you have taken explicit steps to [[wikipedia:Permanent_residence_(United_States)#Abandonment_or_loss_of_permanent_residence_status|abandon]] your residency, the US still considers you to be a US lawful permanent resident.&lt;ref name=accidentalamerican /&gt; A long-term green card holder abandoning US residency may also be subject to the US's [[US tax pitfalls for a US person living abroad#Expatriation tax|expatriation tax]] regime.
|}

{{Anchor|Q3}}
=== Q3. Are you a US resident? ===

If '''yes''' and you '''are''' a US citizen, go to [[#A1|Result A1]]. If '''yes''' and you '''are not''' a US citizen, go to [[#Q4|Question 4]]. If '''no''', go to [[#A2|Result A2]].

{| class="wikitable"
|A US citizen or green card holder can use the [[wikipedia:Physical_presence_test#United_States|physical presence test]] or the [[wikipedia:Bona_fide_resident_test|bona fide residency test]] as a measure of whether or not the US considers them to be resident in the US. US citizens living outside the US get a limited exemption on their US taxes as applied to earned income,&lt;ref name=feie&gt;{{cite web| publisher=Wikipedia| url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_earned_income_exclusion| title=Foreign earned income exclusions| accessdate=March 17, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; but no exemption for US taxes on unearned income such as dividends or interest.
|}

{{Anchor|Q3b}}
=== Q3b. Are you a US tax resident? ===

If '''yes''', go to [[#Q5|Question 5]]. If '''no''', go to [[#Q6|Question 6]].

{| class="wikitable"
|For temporary US residents, such as H-1B and L-1 work visa holders, the US uses the [[wikipedia:Substantial_Presence_Test|substantial presence test]] to determine whether a person is a 'US resident for tax purposes'.

The test involves several unintuitive calculations, but as a general rule you can usually assume that if you have not been in the US in any given year (or perhaps only been there on vacation, and do not hold a US work visa such as H-1B or L-1) then you are not a 'US resident for tax purposes' and the answer is '''no''', and if you have stayed in the US for several months, and especially over six months, and you are not [[wikipedia:Substantial_Presence_Test#Exemptions|exempt]] from the substantial presence test (perhaps by holding a US student visa such as F-1 or J-1), then you probably are a 'US resident for tax purposes' and the answer is '''yes'''.

:'''Warning''': A 'US resident for tax purposes' has all the same onerous US tax and reporting burdens as a green card holder or US citizen.
|}

{{Anchor|Q4}}
=== Q4. Do you plan to retire in the US? ===

If '''yes''', go to [[#A1|Result A1]]. If '''no''', go to [[#A3|Result A3]].

{| class="wikitable"
|For best results, you probably want to hold different investments if you plan to retire in another country compared to if you plan to retire in the US. The problem here is one of continuity of investing. Everything works best if you can leave it alone. If you hold a portfolio of investments that work perfectly well in the US but could turn into a tax nightmare when you move to a different country, you might effectively be forced to sell to cash before moving. This can be disruptive, and potentially also an unwanted and unnecessary tax cost.

If you are unsure, try following both paths to get an idea of the challenges of each.
|}

{{Anchor|Q5}}
=== Q5. Do you plan to get a green card? ===

If '''yes''', go to [[#Q4|Question 4]]. If '''no''', go to [[#A3|Result A3]].

{| class="wikitable"
|As a temporary US resident, do you intend to stay longer and obtain a green card, or do you plan to leave the US and return to your home country (or move to a third country) when or before your current US work visa expires? If you think you will get a green card and stay in the US, perhaps even naturalizing as a US citizen in time, you will want to arrange your portfolio accordingly.
|}

{{Anchor|Q6}}
=== Q6. Does your country have an income tax treaty with the US? ===

If '''yes''', go to [[#Q7|Question 7]]. If '''no''', go to [[#A4|Result A4]].

{| class="wikitable"
|The US has [https://www.irs.gov/businesses/international-businesses/united-states-income-tax-treaties-a-to-z income tax treaties] with a number of countries.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;At the time of writing, the US maintains income tax treaties with Australia, Austria, Bangladesh, Barbados, Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, Chile, China, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Egypt, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Jamaica, Japan, Kazakhstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Mexico, Morocco, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Pakistan, Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sri Lanka, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Trinidad &amp; Tobago, Tunisia, Turkey, Ukraine, United Kingdom, and Venezuela.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;The US terminated its tax treaty with Hungary, effective 1st Jan 2024 for dividend withholding tax. For more, see: {{cite web| url=https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0872| title= United States’ Notification of Termination of 1979 Tax Convention with Hungary| publisher=US Treasury| date=July 15, 2022| accessdate=September 12, 2022}} Also: {{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/a-24-05.pdf| title=Announcement Regarding the Effective Date of Termination of the United States-Hungary Tax Treaty| publisher=US Treasury| date=December 29, 2023| accessdate=January 1, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt; Check this list to see if it includes your home country.

While browsing this part of the IRS web site, perhaps take a look at the actual treaty text for your own country, if for no other reason than to see how densely written and difficult to understand US income tax treaties are.

There are some surprising holes in the US tax treaty network. For example, there is no treaty with Hong Kong and it is not covered by the treaty with China. And the treaty with Chile was executed in 2010 but did not enter into force until 2024.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| publisher=National Law Review| url=https://www.natlawreview.com/article/future-united-states-chile-bilateral-tax-treaty-remains-uncertain| title=Future of United States – Chile Bilateral Tax Treaty Remains Uncertain| accessdate=March 17, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2003| title=Treasury Announces Entry into Force of Income Tax Treaty with Chile| publisher=U.S. Department of the Treasury| accessdate=April 24, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

US income tax treaties and US estate tax treaties are for the most part entirely separate things. There are many more income tax treaties than there are estate tax treaties.

|The US has [https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/estate-gift-tax-treaties-international estate tax treaties] with just fifteen countries.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;At the time of writing, the US maintains estate tax treaties with Australia, Austria, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, South Africa, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. The estate tax treaties with Ireland and South Africa may be deficient in important areas.&lt;/ref&gt; Check this list to see if it includes your home country.

Canada does not have a separate estate tax treaty with the US. Instead, the US maintains a single treaty with Canada that combines both income taxes and estate taxes. Under this combined treaty, Canadians receive protection up to the level of the US estate tax exemption allowed to US citizens, the same as separate US estate tax treaties for other countries generally provide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/businesses/international-businesses/canada-tax-treaty-documents| title=Canada - Tax Treaty Documents| publisher=IRS| accessdate=August 9, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Your [[wikipedia:Domicile_(law)|domicile]] generally controls estate tax treaties. ''Domicile'' is where your permanent home is, and although it includes residence as one of its elements, residence alone in a country may not be enough to give you coverage from a US estate tax treaty, so you may need to be particularly careful here. A few US estate tax treaties also cover citizens even when perhaps not resident or domiciled in the treaty partner country,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/147634389.pdf| title=Estate, Gift, and Generation-Skipping Transfer Tax Treaties| publisher=SMU Law Review| date=1983| accessdate=August 1, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example the UK.

Estate tax treaties with some countries contain a 'pro rata unified credit' provision that generally raises the US estate tax exemption to the same level a US citizen gets. Countries with this provision are Australia, Canada, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Japan and Switzerland. Countries with 'new' treaties that would generally also raise the US estate tax exemption are Austria, Denmark, Netherlands and UK. Ireland's treaty and South Africa's treaty are both 'old' and may not contain any provisions to raise the US estate tax exemption.

Some treaties have significant holes in them, for example Ireland's and South Africa's may not actually extend the full estate tax exemption for US citizens to Irish and South African investors,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.kplaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2025-United-States-Estate-and-Gift-Tax-An-Overview-for-Foreigners-Investing-in-the-United-States.pdf| title=United States Estate and Gift Tax - An Overview for Foreigners Investing in the United States| publisher=Kohnen &amp; Patton LLP| date=2025| accessdate=May 28, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Switzerland's may not protect from double estate-taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| publisher=Baker McKenzie, Deloitte| url=https://www.mustachianpost.com/de/files/0177/flaws_in_the_current_US_Swiss_estate_tax_treaty_and_the_need_for_a_modern_treaty.pdf| title=Flaws in the Current U.S.-Swiss Estate Tax Treaty and the Need for a Modern Treaty| accessdate=June 11, 2023| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210709191805/https://www.mustachianpost.com/de/files/0177/flaws_in_the_current_US_Swiss_estate_tax_treaty_and_the_need_for_a_modern_treaty.pdf| archive-date=July 9, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general then, finding your country in the list of US estate tax treaties is often just the first step in uncovering whether you are fully protected from US estate taxes. You would need to research thoroughly to be sure that the answer to the question above is really '''yes'''.

With the possible exception of Canada, if your country is not included in the IRS list of US estate tax treaties, the answer is clearly '''no'''.&lt;ref group=note&gt;It is often difficult in practice to obtain the text of a US estate tax treaty.

For holdings below $60,000, see also the results from following [[#Q8|Question 8]].

{| class="wikitable"
|The US levies its [[wikipedia:Estate_tax_in_the_United_States#Non-residents|estate tax]] on the US situated holdings of nonresident aliens.&lt;ref name=jpm /&gt; This includes US domiciled funds and ETFs, as well as any directly held US stocks. US estate taxes apply to the entire holding, not just any accrued but as-yet untaxed gains, begin at a low $60,000 of US situated holdings&lt;ref name=estate60k&gt;{{cite web| publisher=IRS| url=https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/some-nonresidents-with-us-assets-must-file-estate-tax-returns| title=Some Nonresidents with U.S. Assets Must File Estate Tax Returns| accessdate=March 17, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; (a level that is ''far'' below the exemption allowed to US citizens and residents), and climb rapidly to a rate of 40%. This is discriminatory, and you need to avoid it.

=== A2. Avoid non-US domiciled funds and ETFs ===

{{See also|Taxation as a US person living abroad|US tax pitfalls for a US person living abroad}}

&lt;h4&gt;'''You are tax-resident outside the US, but at the same time the US claims you as a 'US person'.'''&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;'''Or, you are tax-resident inside the US, but still hold investments in a country you lived in previously.'''&lt;/h4&gt;

{| class="wikitable"
|If you live ''outside'' the US, unless your country of residence does not levy any income taxes, your income is fully taxable to potentially several conflicting tax regimes at the same time. The intersection of multiple incoherent tax regimes is an uncomfortable position.

If you live ''inside'' the US, any investments you hold in countries you lived in previously may be at risk from punitive US 'anti-offshore' tax laws.

==== Avoiding the US PFIC tax trap ====

:'''Warning''': This is a ''major'' US tax trap, and one that you should try your utmost to avoid.

Your major problem when investing will be the US's [[Passive_foreign_investment_company|PFIC]] tax regime. This tax law penalizes holdings of non-US domiciled funds and ETFs with heavy taxes that can, if left long enough, consume 100% of your gains.&lt;ref name=pfic100 /&gt; The obvious way to avoid this problem is to use only US domiciled funds and ETFs.

Unfortunately, this is not always possible. Your home or former country may well have its own 'anti-offshore funds' rules, similar to the US PFIC rules (although unlikely to be anything like as unpleasant), and these would capture any US domiciled funds or ETFs you hold. Worse, US domiciled funds and ETFs may not be available to you, where non-US brokers do not offer them and US brokers refuse service to investors who are not US residents (even if they are US citizens).

If you are stuck in this way, your main other option is to invest through individual stocks. These escape PFIC and other 'anti-offshore funds' rules. You may be able to hold PFIC funds inside of foreign pensions and so avoid the worst of the US PFIC tax treatment, but the US tax rules on foreign pensions can themselves be punitive where these pensions are not protected by treaty (and indeed, many treaties do not cover pensions at all well).

Failing this, if you live outside the US and have a non-US person spouse you might consider letting them do all the investing for you as a couple. They will have to be careful as nonresident alien investors themselves to avoid all of the US tax traps, but they will not face US PFIC tax.

==== Avoiding the US estate and gift tax trap ====

There is no unlimited marital exemption for US estate and gift taxes where the recipient spouse is not a US citizen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| publisher=Wikipedia| url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marital_deduction| title= Marital deduction| accessdate=March 17, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can produce a harsh outcome for mixed-citizenship couples, although the high estate tax exemption allowed to US citizens usually makes this a non-issue. When gifting to a non-US citizen spouse though, take care to fill out the appropriate gift tax return where the gift exceeds the US annual gift allowance for non-US citizen spouses.

Beyond the estate and gift tax exemptions, a 'QDOT' trust is one possible way to defer US tax on gifts and bequests to a non-US citizen spouse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| publisher=Nolo| url=https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/using-qdots-plan-noncitizen-spouses.html| title=Using QDOTs to Plan for Noncitizen Spouses| accessdate=October 22, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to note that a QDOT does not reduce or avoid the US estate tax, but only defers it.

==== Avoiding US tax traps on a non-US pension ====

A few treaties provide for non-US pensions to be treated for US tax in a way approximately equivalent to US pensions. For those that do not, and for non-treaty countries, a local pension can be a US tax nightmare.

Symmetrically, many countries do not recognise US pensions as tax deferred, meaning that holding one while living in that country can be another tax nightmare. How much of a nightmare depends on any treaty and the local tax laws for 'offshore' accounts.

In practice, there is often not much you can do to neuter this tax trap. Many countries do not permit any early access to pension funds, meaning that you might have to deal with tax difficulties of these accounts for perhaps many decades.

==== Avoiding US tax traps on a non-US tax-free investment wrapper ====

The US generally does not recognise any other country's tax-free wrapper accounts. The result is that anything you hold in those is fully taxable to the US under normal rules, including PFIC treatments and potentially complex trust tax reporting.&lt;ref name=foreigntrust&gt;{{cite web| publisher=IRS| url=https://www.irs.gov/businesses/international-businesses/foreign-trust-reporting-requirements| title=Foreign Trust Reporting Requirements| accessdate=March 17, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples include UK [[UK Individual Savings Accounts|Individual Savings Accounts]] (ISA), Canadian [[finiki:Tax-Free Savings Account|Tax-Free Savings Accounts]] (TFSA), Japanese [[Investing from Japan#Nippon Individual Savings Accounts (NISA)|NISA]] accounts, and French [[Wikipedia:fr:Assurance-vie en France|Assurance-vie]] and [[Wikipedia:fr:Plan d'Épargne en Actions|Plan d'Épargne en Actions]] accounts. These are entirely tax-free to local country residents who are not US persons, but fully taxed by the US if you are a US citizen or a green card holder.

==== Avoiding US "information reporting form" penalty traps ====

If you hold non-US accounts, and the balance in these accounts exceeds certain thresholds, you may have to file annual reports indicating the existence of, and balances in, these accounts.&lt;ref name="fbar" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fatca" /&gt; In some cases, the threshold is relatively low, for example $10,000. And reporting often triggers on the ''aggregate highest balance in accounts'' during the year. This means that the same $5,001 transferred between two different accounts triggers reporting, because the ''aggregate'' of highest balances for the year is $10,002.

The reporting rules cover nearly all non-US account types, including bank and credit union cash accounts, investment and brokerage accounts, and pensions. There is no additional tax ''liability'' from reporting these accounts, because you report any income or gains from them elsewhere on your US tax returns. There are however significant ''penalties'' for failing to file these reports.

==== Using US tax treaties ====

Tax treaties offer a number of tax mitigation benefits, and while non-US persons can use all of a treaty's benefits, most treaty benefits will be inaccessible to 'US persons' because the US uses a treaty [https://www.irs.gov/businesses/tax-treaties-can-affect-your-income-tax saving clause].

A treaty 'saving clause' allows the US to ignore the treaty where US citizens or residents are concerned. The treaty normally notes a handful of other treaty clauses as exceptions to the 'saving clause', but the general effect of the 'saving clause' is that US persons cannot use large segments of the treaty to mitigate US tax on their income.&lt;ref group=note&gt;A tax treaty [https://www.irs.gov/businesses/tax-treaties-can-affect-your-income-tax saving clause] is ''technically'' symmetrical, and so affects residents of both countries that have signed the treaty. However, the US is the only treaty party to tax based on citizenship, so that in practice the saving clause erodes the rights of US citizens and US permanent residents (green card holders) under the treaty but leaves non-US citizens generally unaffected.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== A3. Create a relocation-resistant portfolio ===

{{See also|US tax pitfalls for a non-US person moving to the US}}

:While a US resident or green card holder, see also [[#A2|Result A2]].
:For an outline of the situation when you are no longer a US resident or green card holder, see also the results of following [[#Q6|Question 6]] as if you are now resident in your new country.

&lt;h4&gt;'''You are tax-resident in the US, but think you might move or retire outside the US.'''&lt;/h4&gt;

{| class="wikitable"
|International relocation is a ''huge'' problem for investors. It can lead to upheaval not just in taxable portfolios, but potentially also in pension and any other tax sheltered or tax deferred wrappers. Ideally you want to build a portfolio that you can hold across an international move, but this is often impossible.

==== Avoiding US and non-US tax traps on a US pension ====

:'''Warning''': If you move to a country that lacks a US estate tax treaty with the US, your US pension is at risk from US estate taxes. A US pension is treated as a 'US situated asset' for estate tax purposes,&lt;ref name=creative&gt;{{cite web| publisher=Creative Planning| url=https://creativeplanning.com/international/insights/financial-planning-for-foreign-nationals-in-the-us/| title=Financial Planning For Foreign Nationals in the U.S.| accessdate=June 11, 2023| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230128232746/https://creativeplanning.com/international/insights/financial-planning-for-foreign-nationals-in-the-us/| archive-date=January 28, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; no matter what investments you hold inside it. Because the US estate tax exemption for nonresident aliens is low, $60,000, it can catch even modestly sized US pensions.&lt;ref name=jpm /&gt;

Specifically for pension savings, the first thing to consider could be whether a [[Roth IRA|Roth IRA]] might be useful to you. If you are moving to a country without an income tax, a Roth will be fine. A few of the US income tax treaties also protect Roth accounts against tax by another country, but these tend to be rare. The most likely case is that you move to a country that will 'look through' the Roth wrapper and tax income from these assets as if the Roth did not exist. In that case, either hold assets inside the Roth that will not be subject to punitive local taxes, or (worst case) collapse the Roth and take the cash to your new country, then invest locally.

If a Roth is not an option, see if you have any treaty coverage for non-Roth US pensions. If not, the worst that usually happens is that your new country treats your US pension as an unwrapped investment account. It may be tempting to close the US pension entirely and take the balance as cash, but the US's early withdrawal penalties on pensions can make that an undesirable option. Also, weigh up how much employer contribution is in the pension before deciding.

Whether to save into a [[401(k)]] or [[IRA]] ''at all'' can be a tricky decision in itself. Where a US pension will be a tax nightmare once you no longer live in the US, there may be arguments for not using these accounts, or perhaps only participating up to the maximum employer match. To make this decision you will need to compare your employer match with the IRS (and any state) early withdrawal penalty on 401(k)s and IRAs.

If you draw from a US pension as a nonresident alien, the standard US tax withholding rate is 30% and the income counts as either 'effectively connected' income on a [https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-1040-nr 1040-NR] tax return and taxed at graduated US rates, or partially 'effectively connected' (ECI) and partially 30% taxable as 'fixed, determinable, annual or periodic' (FDAP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://hodgen.com/ira-distributions-for-noncovered-expatriates/| title=IRA Distributions for Noncovered Expatriates| publisher=HodgenLaw PC| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160426195920/http://hodgen.com/ira-distributions-for-noncovered-expatriates/| archive-date=April 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Applying these rules can quickly become complicated, and may be impossible due to lack of historical data. However, many tax treaties modify this, for example, for a UK resident, 401(k) and IRA withdrawals are taxable only to the UK and the US rate is 0%. In this case the 401(k) or IRA provider should not withhold any tax under the relevant treaty. Unfortunately, some providers are known to ignore this and withhold US tax anyway, meaning that a [https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-1040-nr 1040-NR] US tax return is required to recover the over-withholding.

==== Avoiding US tax traps on a non-US pension ====

:'''Warning''': This is a ''major'' US tax trap, and one that you should try your utmost to avoid.

As well as the above, you may also need to carefully consider the US tax implications of holding a non-US pension while you are resident in the US. If you still hold a pension from the 'old country', unless protected by a treaty the US will tax gains within it annually as if it were just another offshore investment account.&lt;ref name=foreigntrust /&gt; This can produce some horrific tax results, and ones that are sometimes unavoidable where that country's pension tax laws do not allow any form of early withdrawal.

Double-tax on your pension gains are entirely possible, if the US taxes your pension gains while you are resident but you must again pay local country tax on withdrawals after leaving the US. And you should watch out especially for [[Passive_foreign_investment_company|PFIC]] issues in such accounts, as well as tiresome and duplicative annual US tax 'information reporting forms' for holding this type of account.

You should also watch out for US tax traps that can apply to non-US accounts that you retained after moving to the US. In some countries there are tax-mitigating wrapper accounts which are not strictly ''pensions'', but which you might be able to use as an alternative to a pension. However, because the US does not recognise these account types as tax deferred (that is, as pensions), all the usual US tax rules and tax traps will apply to them for US residents. Examples include UK [[UK Individual Savings Accounts|Individual Savings Accounts]] (ISA), Canadian [[finiki:Tax-Free Savings Account|Tax-Free Savings Accounts]] (TFSA), Japanese [[Investing from Japan#Nippon Individual Savings Accounts (NISA)|NISA]] accounts, and French [[Wikipedia:fr:Assurance-vie en France|Assurance-vie]] and [[Wikipedia:fr:Plan d'Épargne en Actions|Plan d'Épargne en Actions]] accounts.

==== Avoiding US taxable account traps ====

For unwrapped and taxable accounts, check with any applicable US income tax treaty that the investments you hold in it will not be subject to punitive local taxes when you move. Again, some countries either do not levy income taxes or perhaps do not tax investment income. Others are not so benign. In the worst case you can sell to cash and take that with you, although this may generate a US capital gains tax that you would rather avoid.

==== Avoiding the US expatriation tax trap ====

:'''Warning''': This is a ''major'' US tax trap, and one that you should try your utmost to avoid.

In all cases you may also need to watch out for the US's [[US tax pitfalls for a US person living abroad#Expatriation tax|expatriation tax]] if you renounce US citizenship or abandon a green card in order to simplify your tax situation, reducing the number of tax regimes you have to live under from several to just one.

The provisions of the US expatriation tax are draconian, and include immediate taxation of all ''unrealised'' capital gains above an exclusion, immediate taxation of retirement savings accounts as if fully withdrawn on the date of expatriation (even though nothing is actually withdrawn, and with no exclusion), and a harsh transfer tax of 40% on gifts and bequests made back to US persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| publisher=IRS| url=https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/expatriation-tax| title=Expatriation Tax| accessdate=October 19, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Fabio Ambrosio| url=https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3447485| title=How IRS Guidance Makes it impossible to Comply with Section 2801 in 2 Hours or Less| publisher=The Value Examiner| page=35| date=August 2019| accessdate=October 19, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Double-tax and even triple-tax are possible, and perhaps likely, if you are unfortunate enough to be subject to this tax.

This tax is hard to avoid once you have passed the asset and time limits. One useful method to sidestep it though, is to give away enough assets (even if that means filing US gift tax returns where required) so that you then fall below the asset limit.

Treaties may offer little or no protection here. In many ways, the US expatriation tax is written to override existing US tax treaties,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Rebecca M.

=== A4. Avoid US domiciled funds and ETFs and prefer Ireland or other non-US offerings ===

{{See also|Nonresident alien taxation|Nonresident alien investors and Ireland domiciled ETFs}}

&lt;h4&gt;'''You are a US nonresident alien with poor or nonexistent US tax treaty coverage.'''&lt;/h4&gt;

{| class="wikitable"
|If you hold US domiciled funds or ETFs, you will overpay US taxes on dividends, and you also risk a huge loss to US estate taxes if you have the poor judgement to die while holding them.&lt;ref name=kma /&gt;&lt;ref name=nra40 /&gt;

==== Reducing or eliminating the US dividend tax trap ====

If you invest through Ireland domiciled funds or ETFs, you will reduce your US tax liability from as much as 30% for non-treaty countries, down to 15% US rate on dividends from the US stocks your ETFs hold, and down to 0% US rate on the non-US stocks your ETFs hold.

This happens because an ETF domiciled in Ireland can use the US/Ireland tax treaty to obtain a 15% rate on US dividends, and whatever the appropriate treaty rate is with Ireland for dividends from other country stocks.&lt;ref name=dilloneustance /&gt;

==== Eliminating the US estate tax trap ====

:'''Warning''': This is a ''major'' US tax trap, and one that you should try your utmost to avoid.

If you die while holding ''US situated'' assets, the US can apply an [[wikipedia:Estate_tax_in_the_United_States#Non-residents|estate tax]] of up to 40% of the balance above a $60,000 exemption.&lt;ref name=nra40 /&gt; However, when you hold ETFs domiciled in Ireland or another non-US domicile, you do not ''directly'' hold any US assets. This means that you are now entirely protected from US estate tax. The US estate tax cannot 'look through' a fund or ETF to the ultimate individual owner of shares in that fund or ETF.

You can buy most popular non-US domiciled ETFs on the ''London Stock Exchange'' and the ''Euronext'' exchange, so you will need to find a broker that offers the appropriate exchanges. [[Interactive Brokers|Interactive Brokers]] is a popular choice for many, but be aware that it is US based. This means that you should avoid holding more than $60,000 ''in cash'' at this broker, otherwise US estate taxes again become an issue.&lt;ref name=jpm /&gt;

==== Accumulating (or capitalising) funds ====

Funds and ETFs that pay out dividends regularly to investors are known as 'distributing' funds. Non-US domiciled funds do not pay out capital gains distributions. And there is a class of non-US domiciled funds and ETFs known as 'accumulating' or 'capitalising'. These funds and ETFs retain all the dividends paid to them by the stocks that they hold, so that their 'net asset value' rises in response.

Different countries treat 'accumulating' ETFs differently, but in some cases this can lead to an advantage.

The neutral case is where a country taxes 'notional' dividends annually. That is, it taxes the dividend as if you received it, even though you did not (and later allows a reduction for any capital gains taxes). Here, holding 'accumulating' ETFs in a taxable account has no tax advantage. It can however be convenient to hold these inside tax shelters such as pensions.

There is a better outcome where a country treats the entire return as a capital gain and where the capital gains tax rate is lower than the rate on dividends. If your country does this, holding 'accumulating' ETFs effectively transforms your dividends into capital gains for a tax advantage.

&lt;h4&gt;'''Or, you will never hold more than $60,000 in US situated assets.'''&lt;/h4&gt;

{| class="wikitable"
|If you are a US nonresident alien with average US tax treaty coverage, your own country's US dividend tax rate is equal to that paid by a non-US domiciled ETF. In this case, you can choose your holdings carefully to optimise for local taxes. This requires you to fully understand the tax regime in your own country, especially any 'anti-offshore fund' rules or regulations, but the results can be worthwhile.

If you are a US nonresident alien with poor or no US tax treaty coverage, and you will never hold more than $60,000 in US situated assets,&lt;ref name=estate60k /&gt; and your own country's US dividend tax rate is higher than that paid by a non-US domiciled ETF, you may be able to reclaim this US tax directly from your local tax authority so that its overall cost to you is negated.

In both cases, you need to carefully measure your local marginal tax rate on dividend income, so that you can evaluate whether or not a US domiciled ETF makes sense for you. In general, unless your local marginal tax rate is at least as high as your US dividend tax rate and you can claim full foreign tax credits against local tax, US domiciled ETFs would not be useful investments for you and you should prefer Ireland domiciled ETFs.

In 2018, a new EU regulation known as [https://finance.ec.europa.eu/consumer-finance-and-payments/retail-financial-services/key-information-documents-packaged-retail-and-insurance-based-investment-products-priips_en PRIIPs] came into force. Because no US domiciled funds currently conform to PRIIPs, it is now difficult or even impossible for EU and UK residents to purchase them.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Forum member "finrod_2002" provides details of how an investor might use options trades to work around PRIIPs restrictions, in {{forum post|p=4386305|title=Re: European, dutch investor here: Is investing in VTI and VXUS still a good choice?|date=17 Feb 2019}}, viewed 28 Oct 2019.&lt;/ref&gt; If you are in a country that is covered by PRIIPs, and you cannot work around it, you will need to use non-US domiciled ETFs. Most popular non-US domiciled ETFs can be purchased on the ''London Stock Exchange'' and the ''Euronext'' exchange.

==== Funds that track US indexes ====

For funds or ETFs that track ''only'' the S&amp;P 500 or other ''purely'' US stock indexes, choosing a US domiciled fund may be a good option. You will pay 15% to the US (or higher, if your treaty rate is above the usual 15% US tax treaty rate; and 30% if you have no treaty coverage), but if you can claim that against any local tax then you do not lose by choosing a US domiciled fund or ETF.

By comparison, a fund or ETF domiciled in Ireland and tracking the same index would pay 15% to the US on the dividends it receives, and pay the remaining 85% to you.&lt;ref name=dilloneustance /&gt; But it is likely that this 85% paid out is now fully taxable to your local country, and with no way of obtaining a credit for the 15% paid internally by the ETF (countries differ on this, so check local details carefully). In this case, if your own US treaty rate is 15% you will pay a higher tax overall on the Ireland domiciled ETF compared with the US domiciled one.

==== Funds that track non-US indexes ====

For funds or ETFs that track ''only non-US'' stock indexes, there is no gain from using a US domiciled fund except perhaps for the lower fund annual management charge. In this case, you would pay 15% (or higher, depending on treaty) in US tax that is potentially reclaimable against local tax. By comparison, if you held an Ireland domiciled fund tracking the same index, you would suffer no withholding tax but then have to pay full local tax on the entire dividend, for the same end result.&lt;ref name=dilloneustance /&gt;

==== Funds that track global indexes ====

For global funds, containing a mix of US and non-US stocks, the picture is blurry. Overall you might come out ahead with a US domiciled fund because around 50% of the world's market cap is from US stocks, but the actual outcome is almost entirely impossible to predict with any accuracy.

==== Accumulating (or capitalising) funds ====

Funds and ETFs that pay out dividends regularly to investors are known as 'distributing' funds. The [[wikipedia:Mutual_fund#United_States|US regulations]] for funds and ETFs require a US domiciled fund to pay dividends to holders at least annually. It must also pay out capital gains realised internally by the fund as distributions to holders under some circumstances.

Non-US domiciled funds do not have this [[Index funds and ETFs outside of the US#Accumulating (or capitalizing) and distributing ETF share classes|restriction]]. Non-US domiciled funds do not pay out capital gains distributions. And there is a class of non-US domiciled funds and ETFs known as 'accumulating' or 'capitalising'. These funds and ETFs retain all the dividends paid to them by the stocks that they hold, so that their 'net asset value' rises in response.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Because of the toxic combination of US regulation for US domiciled ETFs with the US's [[Passive_foreign_investment_company|PFIC]] tax regime, 'accumulating' ETFs are effectively off-limits to US investors, and available only to nonresident aliens.&lt;/ref&gt;

Different countries treat 'accumulating' ETFs differently, but in some cases this can lead to an advantage.

The neutral case is where a country taxes 'notional' dividends annually. That is, it taxes the dividend as if you received it, even though you did not (and later allows a reduction for any capital gains taxes). Here, holding 'accumulating' ETFs in a taxable account has no tax advantage. It can however be convenient to hold these inside tax shelters such as pensions.

There is a better outcome where a country treats the entire return as a capital gain and where the capital gains tax rate is lower than the rate on dividends. If your country does this, holding 'accumulating' ETFs effectively transforms your dividends into capital gains for a tax advantage.

Using a '''{{PAGENAME}}''' helps non-US investors decide whether to use US domiciled or non-US domiciled ETFs.

When selecting an index tracking fund, non-US investors (that is, US [[Nonresident alien taxation|nonresident aliens]]) have a broad choice between US domiciled ETFs and non-US domiciled ETFs. This article summarises the recommended [[Domicile#Domicile of a fund | ETF domicile]] that non-US investors might use, based on their own country of residence and domicile. The goal is for investors to obtain the best tax result.

These tables do not cover every nuance of ETF domicile selection, but rather they aim to offer a broad-brush overview. You may find that there are cases where they do not offer optimal results, for example where US taxes interact with your local country taxes in subtle ways. See the [[#Interaction between local tax rates and US withholding taxes|notes]] at the end of the page for more.

Because of 2018 European MiFID and [[EU investing#EU legislation : UCITS, MiFID II and PRIIPs|PRIIPs]] regulations, it is now difficult or impossible for European and UK investors to buy US domiciled funds. For more, see the [[#Recommendations explained|explanation]] at the end of the page.

== ETF domicile recommendations by asset class ==

Finding the best ETF domicile can be heavily influenced by asset class. Some asset classes are almost always better held in non-US domiciled ETFs, and not in US domiciled ones. The table below summarises the normal best ETF domicile to choose for particular asset classes.

Holding ''non-US stocks'' and ''non-US bonds'' through US domiciled ETFs adds a second and entirely avoidable layer of US tax to dividends paid to nonresident aliens. As a general rule, nonresident aliens should '''avoid''' US domiciled ETFs and '''prefer''' non-US domiciled ones for all asset classes except US stocks and US bonds.

For ''US stocks'', finding the best ETF domicile depends on your country of residence and domicile. The [[#stock_table|country table for stocks]] breaks this decision down further. In a few cases, a US domiciled ETF can be suitable.

For ''US bonds'', most nonresident alien investors should probably '''prefer''' non-US domiciled ETFs. Some nonresident alien investors can '''consider''' a US domiciled ETF, but only where there is no non-US bond component, and '''contingent''' on [[#Specific country notes|adequate coverage]] from a [https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/estate-gift-tax-treaties-international US estate tax treaty]. Apart from the potential for a lower expense ratio, there is no particular ''gain'' to using US domiciled ETFs here, only a lack of specific US tax ''penalty'' that using non-US domiciled ETFs always bypasses. If you live in the EU and the UK, your access to US domiciled ETFs is in any case likely to be '''limited''' due to [[EU investing#EU legislation : UCITS, MiFID II and PRIIPs|PRIIPs]].

For complex cases, where an ETF contains investments from more than one of these asset classes, you will need to use your judgement to choose the best ETF domicile, or avoid this type of ETF and instead hold only ETFs that contain a single asset class listed in the table. In general, for ETFs that hold a mix of asset classes (for example a global stock index ETF, where US stocks are a large component, more than 50%, of world market cap), choosing non-US domiciled ETFs is most often the safest and best choice.

== Special exemption for interest distributions paid as dividends ==

Where a US domiciled ETF receives ''US source'' interest on its holdings, and that interest would not have been taxable to a US nonresident if paid directly, brokers can exclude the part of the dividend attributable to this interest from nonresident withholding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| publisher=K&amp;L Gates| url=http://www.klgates.com/permanent-us-withholding-tax-rules-for-non-us-investors-in-rics--a-new-distribution-opportunity-01-12-2016/| title=Permanent U.S. Withholding Tax Relief for Non-U.S. Investors in U.S. Mutual Funds| accessdate=May 23, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; It will be most common in bond ETFs. For it to occur correctly both the ETF provider and the broker need to be aware of the relevant qualified interest income (QII) regulations.

This exemption aims to reduce your US tax on a US domiciled ETF holding US bonds so that it is the same as an Ireland domiciled ETF holding identical assets. However, the exemption is particularly narrow. It does not apply to any ''non-US source'' interest that the ETF receives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1697&amp;context=faculty_scholarship| title=Foreign Investors in U.S. Mutual Funds: The Trouble with Treaties, p. 487| publisher=Fordham| author=Jeffrey M. Colon| accessdate=May 26, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that a US domiciled ETF containing non-US bonds suffers the standard 30% or lower treaty rate US tax on its dividends.

In other words, any and every ''non-US country's interest'' is nevertheless ''taxed by the US when paid out to non-US investors'' if it has the misfortune to first pass through a US domiciled ETF. You should nearly always strongly '''avoid''' US domiciled ETFs holding non-US bonds, and strongly '''prefer''' non-US domiciled ETFs for these assets.

While this exemption may make the choice between US domiciled and non-US domiciled ETFs holding purely US bonds a more balanced one, in practice US estate tax risks will often dominate the decision. Aside from any slight gain from a lower expense ratio, there is no benefit to using a US domiciled ETF to hold US bonds where a usable non-US domiciled one exists.

== ETF domicile recommendations table for US stocks ==

Find your country of residence and [[Wikipedia:Domicile_(law)|domicile]] in the table below&lt;ref group=note&gt;This table is built using a Python script. You can find the source code for the script in the [[Talk:{{PAGENAME}}|discussion page]] associated with this page.&lt;/ref&gt; to help you decide whether US domiciled ETFs or non-US domiciled ETFs are likely to be the best ones for you to use for your own allocation to US stocks.

If your country is not listed in this table, then it has no US tax treaties. In that case, the 'Other Countries' entry applies to you.

== Recommendations explained ==

The tables above offer recommendations for holdings below $60,000 and above $60,000. This is because if you are [[Wikipedia:Domicile_(law)|domiciled]] in a country without a [https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/estate-gift-tax-treaties-international US estate tax treaty], your US estate taxes begin at a discriminatory&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Omer Harel| url=http://www.taxhistory.org/www/features.nsf/Articles/EF4B18A62361343F8525792100546337| title=Rethinking the U.S. Estate Tax on Nonresident Aliens| publisher=University of Michigan Law School, published by TaxAnalysts| date=2011| accessdate=June 11, 2023| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211025155849/http://www.taxhistory.org/www/features.nsf/Articles/EF4B18A62361343F8525792100546337| archive-date=October 25, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; $60,000 of total US situated investments,&lt;ref name=estate60k&gt;{{cite web| publisher=IRS| url=https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/some-nonresidents-with-us-assets-must-file-estate-tax-returns| title=Some Nonresidents with U.S. Assets Must File Estate Tax Returns| accessdate=March 17, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; and rapidly rise to 40% of the balance.

Because of the threat of extortionate US estate taxes, if you live in a country without a US estate tax treaty,&lt;ref name=estatetaxtreaties&gt;{{cite web| publisher=IRS| url=https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/estate-gift-tax-treaties-international| title=Estate &amp; Gift Tax Treaties (International)| accessdate=March 17, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; or if your country's US estate tax treaty is '''deficient''', you should '''avoid''' US domiciled ETFs where the balance exceeds $60,000, and strongly '''prefer''' non-US domiciled ETFs instead.

Ireland is the most common domicile for non-US domiciled ETFs, although Luxembourg is another popular non-US domicile for ETFs. Of the two, Ireland has the better treatment for dividends from US stocks. ETFs domiciled in Ireland can take advantage of the US/Ireland treaty rate of 15%, but because of a less favourable US treaty ETFs domiciled in Luxembourg suffer 30% tax withholding on dividends from US stocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| publisher=KPMG| url=https://assets.kpmg/content/dam/kpmg/lu/pdf/2019/lu-en-investements-funds-wht-study-2019.pdf| title=KPMG Withholding Tax Study 2019| accessdate=March 1, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general then, if '''avoiding''' US domiciled ETFs you should '''prefer''' Ireland domiciled ETFs over Luxembourg domiciled ones unless the ETF itself holds no US stocks.&lt;ref group=note&gt;A special case of this would be a Luxembourg domiciled ETF that tracks an index of US stocks, but is a [[synthetic ETF]]. This type of ETF uses swaps and futures to replicate the returns of the index it tracks, but without holding the actual index stocks. Not holding these stocks can reduce or eliminate the drag from US dividend withholding tax. Note however that synthetic ETFs introduce a few additional risks, compared to funds that hold actual stocks.&lt;/ref&gt;

If your country has a [https://www.irs.gov/businesses/international-businesses/united-states-income-tax-treaties-a-to-z US income tax treaty], and if it also has a US estate tax treaty&lt;ref name=estatetaxtreaties /&gt; that is not '''deficient''' or where your US ETF holdings balance will always be below $60,000, and if your country's US tax treaty rate&lt;ref name=treatyrates&gt;{{cite web| publisher=IRS| url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-lbi/tax-treaty-table-1.pdf| title=Tax Rates on Income Other Than Personal Service Income Under Chapter 3, Internal Revenue Code, and Income Tax Treaties (Rev. May 2023)| accessdate=June 19, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; is lower than the US/Ireland treaty rate of 15%, you may generally '''prefer''' US domiciled ETFs where some or all of the ETF holdings are US stocks. If however your country's US tax treaty rate is higher than the US/Ireland tax treaty rate, you should '''prefer''' Ireland domiciled ETFs. Also, if an ETF holds only non-US stocks, or if holds bonds, then you should '''consider''' Ireland domiciled ETFs. 

As of 2018, an EU-wide regulation known as [[EU investing#EU legislation : UCITS, MiFID II and PRIIPs|PRIIPs]] took effect. As a result, US domiciled ETFs are now '''limited''' for residents of EU countries&lt;ref name=eucountries&gt;{{cite web| publisher=European Union| url=https://europa.eu/european-union/about-eu/countries_en| title=Countries| accessdate=March 17, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; (and non-EU countries which conform to EU regulations), and effectively unavailable to retail investors in these countries. If you live in an EU country where the US tax treaty rate is lower than the US/Ireland tax treaty rate of 15%, you may nevertheless have to '''accept''' Ireland domiciled ETFs and live with the slightly worse tax result.

If your country's US tax treaty rate&lt;ref name=treatyrates /&gt; equals the US/Ireland tax treaty rate of 15%, for ETFs that hold mostly or only US stocks then you can '''consider''' either US or non-US domiciled ETFs, although you should restrict investments in US domiciled ETFs to below $60,000 if your country does not have a US estate tax treaty,&lt;ref name=estatetaxtreaties /&gt; or if its US estate tax treaty is '''deficient'''. Choosing the best ETF domicile in this case will usually be decided by a combination of how local tax laws treat 'offshore' funds, whether and how they provide foreign tax credits, and any large differences in the ETF annual charges. For ETFs holding only non-US stocks, or holding only bonds, '''consider''' Ireland domiciled ETFs. These may produce a better tax outcome for you because you will avoid paying US withholding tax on their dividends.

If you live in a country without a US income tax treaty&lt;ref name=incometaxtreaties&gt;{{cite web| publisher=IRS| url=https://www.irs.gov/businesses/international-businesses/united-states-income-tax-treaties-a-to-z| title=United States Income Tax Treaties - A to Z| accessdate=March 17, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; and without a US estate tax treaty&lt;ref name=estatetaxtreaties /&gt; you should strongly '''avoid''' US domiciled ETFs and strongly '''prefer''' non-US domiciled ones. For you, choosing US domiciled ETFs will probably lead to poor tax results all round.

In the notes above, "non-US domiciled ETFs" would typically be Vanguard's or iShares' Ireland domiciled ETFs, but others are available.

== Specific country notes ==

There is no US tax treaty with Hong Kong and it is not covered by the treaty with China. The treaty with Chile was executed in 2010 but did not enter into force until 2024.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| publisher=National Law Review| url=https://www.natlawreview.com/article/future-united-states-chile-bilateral-tax-treaty-remains-uncertain| title=Future of United States – Chile Bilateral Tax Treaty Remains Uncertain| accessdate=March 17, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2003| title=Treasury Announces Entry into Force of Income Tax Treaty with Chile| publisher=U.S. Department of the Treasury| accessdate=April 24, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2025, the tax treaty with Vietnam, signed in 2015, is not in force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.dfdl.com/resources/legal-and-tax-updates/tax-alert-the-income-tax-treaty-between-vietnam/| title=The income tax treaty between Vietnam and the United States | publisher=DFDL| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230321004451/https://www.dfdl.com/resources/legal-and-tax-updates/tax-alert-the-income-tax-treaty-between-vietnam/| archive-date=March 21, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2022, the US announced that it would terminate its tax treaty with Hungary, effective January 1st, 2024 for dividend tax withholding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0872| title= United States’ Notification of Termination of 1979 Tax Convention with Hungary| publisher=US Treasury| date=July 15, 2022| accessdate=September 12, 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, US dividend withholding tax on US source dividends has increased from 15% to 30% for Hungarian investors who hold US stocks and any US domiciled funds or ETFs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/a-24-05.pdf| title=Announcement 2024-5 - Announcement Regarding the Effective Date of Termination of the United States-Hungary Tax Treaty| publisher=US Treasury| date=December 29, 2023| accessdate=January 1, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The US tax treaty with the UK allows for a 0% tax withholding for dividends paid to UK pension funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/businesses/international-businesses/united-kingdom-uk-tax-treaty-documents| title=United Kingdom (UK) - Tax Treaty Documents| publisher=IRS| accessdate=August 9, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; A UK investor might therefore obtain a tax benefit by holding their US stock allocation in US domiciled ETFs, rather than non-US domiciled ones, within a UK [[UK personal pensions|personal pension]]. In practice however, [[EU investing#EU legislation : UCITS, MiFID II and PRIIPs|PRIIPs]] may frustrate or prevent this.

The US estate tax treaty with Switzerland may not protect against potential double-tax on US situated assets,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| publisher=Baker McKenzie, Deloitte| url=https://www.mustachianpost.com/de/files/0177/flaws_in_the_current_US_Swiss_estate_tax_treaty_and_the_need_for_a_modern_treaty.pdf| title=Flaws in the Current U.S.-Swiss Estate Tax Treaty and the Need for a Modern Treaty| accessdate=June 11, 2023| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210709191805/https://www.mustachianpost.com/de/files/0177/flaws_in_the_current_US_Swiss_estate_tax_treaty_and_the_need_for_a_modern_treaty.pdf| archive-date=July 9, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Swiss investors are probably protected up to the level of the US estate tax exemption allowed to US citizens.

The Ireland and South Africa estate tax treaties are very old, and unlike other US estate tax treaties they may not raise the US estate tax exemption to the level allowed to US citizens, making them '''deficient'''. Irish and South African investors should check this carefully before proceeding.

Canada does not have a separate estate tax treaty with the US. Instead, the US maintains a single treaty with Canada that combines both income taxes and estate taxes. Under this combined treaty, Canadians receive protection up to the level of the US estate tax exemption allowed to US citizens, the same as generally provided by the separate US estate tax treaties for other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/businesses/international-businesses/canada-tax-treaty-documents| title=Canada - Tax Treaty Documents| publisher=IRS| accessdate=August 9, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--
At the time of writing the helpful folk at [https://taxtreatylaw.com/ Tax Treaty Law] offer convenient access to the text of both [https://taxtreatylaw.com/estate-gift/ US estate tax] and [https://taxtreatylaw.com/income-tax/ US income tax] treaties. --&gt;

== Residence and domicile ==

[https://www.irs.gov/businesses/international-businesses/united-states-income-tax-treaties-a-to-z US income tax treaties] are generally controlled by your country of residence. Being a 'tax resident' of a country is normally sufficient to allow you to use that country's income tax treaty with the US.

In contrast, [https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/estate-gift-tax-treaties-international US estate tax treaties] are generally controlled by your [[Wikipedia:Domicile_(law)|domicile]] rather than your country of residence. ''Domicile'' is where your permanent home is, and although it includes residence as one of its elements, residence alone in a country may not be enough to gain you coverage from a US estate tax treaty, so you may need to be particularly careful here. A few US estate tax treaties also cover citizens even when perhaps not resident or domiciled in the treaty partner country,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/147634389.pdf| title=Estate, Gift, and Generation-Skipping Transfer Tax Treaties| publisher=SMU Law Review| date=1983| accessdate=August 1, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example the UK.

== Interaction between local tax rates and US withholding taxes ==

If you live in a country with an income tax, and if your local tax rate on dividends exceeds the US tax withholding rate for your country,&lt;ref name=treatyrates /&gt; and if you can claim a credit against local tax for US withholding tax, then you can '''consider''' using US domiciled ETFs where appropriate. This is because the tax credit will leave you in a neutral position.

For other cases you will need to understand whether an Ireland domiciled ETF will produce a better tax outcome. For ETFs that hold non-US stocks or only bonds, an Ireland domiciled ETF might generally be a safer choice in all circumstances. Ireland domiciled ETFs are tax-neutral,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| publisher=Irish Funds| url=https://files.irishfunds.ie/1481206562-IF_ETFs_Brochure_WEB.pdf| title=WHY IRELAND FOR ETFs| accessdate=March 19, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning that all the income generated within the ETF flows to the investor without any other taxes being deducted or withheld by Ireland. In contrast, with a US domiciled ETF you could end up having to pay US withholding tax on income generated entirely from non-US assets, something that does not occur with Ireland domiciled ETFs.

The picture is more confused for global funds that contain both US and non-US assets. However, because the US is more than half of global stock markets, this generally argues for following the recommendations in the table above for this type of fund.

In truly marginal cases a cheaper expense ratio can occasionally swing the balance in favour of US domiciled ETFs. Here everything will depend heavily on your own tax rate as an investor and your ability to use foreign tax credits against local tax.

Finally, as a general rule of thumb, bear in mind that ''most of the time'', most non-US investors should '''prefer''' Ireland domiciled ETFs to US domiciled ones. The majority of the exceptions are found where US domiciled ETF access is '''limited''', and where this limit is enforced by EU or similar local regulation,&lt;ref group=note&gt;Forum member "finrod_2002" provides details of how an investor might use options trades to work around PRIIPs restrictions, in {{forum post|p=4386305|title=Re: European, dutch investor here: Is investing in VTI and VXUS still a good choice?|date=17 Feb 2019}}, viewed 28 Oct 2019.&lt;/ref&gt; investors may nevertheless only be able to use ETFs domiciled in Ireland, Luxembourg, and other EU countries anyway.

A '''{{PAGENAME}}''' progressively takes a larger percentage of income from higher-income groups than from lower-income groups and is based on the concept of ability to pay. A progressive tax system might, for example, tax low-income taxpayers at 10 percent, middle-income taxpayers at 15 percent and high-income taxpayers at 30 percent. The U.S. federal income tax is based on the progressive tax system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://apps.irs.gov/app/understandingTaxes/student/whys_thm03_les03.jsp |title= Understanding Taxes (Student)|last= |first= |date= |website= |publisher=Internal Revenue Service|accessdate= November 26, 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;This is in contrast to a ''proportional or flat tax'' that takes the same percentage of income from all income groups.

==Taxable income==
Before looking at how this works in the U.S. income tax system, the concept of "taxable income" needs to be understood.

You can receive income in the form of money, property, or services. In most cases, an amount included in your income is taxable unless it is specifically exempted by law.&lt;ref name="IRS"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.irs.gov/publications/p525 |title= Publication 525, Taxable and Nontaxable Income|last= |first= |date= |website= |publisher=Internal Revenue Service|accessdate= December 1, 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taxable income is your gross income minus the deductions described in 26 U.S.C. Section 63.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/63|title=&lt;nowiki&gt;[USC03]&lt;/nowiki&gt; 26 USC 63: Taxable income defined|last= |first= |date= |website=|publisher= Cornell Legal Information Institute|accessdate= September 10, 2025 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Income that is taxable must be reported on your return and is subject to tax. Income that is nontaxable may have to be shown on your tax return but isn’t taxable.&lt;ref name="IRS" /&gt;

==Tax rate increases as taxable income increases==

As Taxable income increases, the amount of tax paid on each additional dollar increases (see Marginal rate [[#Marginal rate | below]]). This is the progressive aspect of the tax - higher income means possibly paying more tax on that additional portion of income. A proportional or flat tax would apply the same percentage regardless of income.

The figure below is a graphical representation of the tax table.
{| style="border: 1px solid #BBB;"
||[[File:Income tax table.png|600px]]
|}

===Tax bracket===
A tax bracket is the range of taxable income to which a tax rate applies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.hrblock.com/tax-center/irs/tax-brackets-and-rates/what-are-the-tax-brackets/ |title= What Are the Tax Brackets?|last= |first= |date= |website= |publisher= H&amp;R Block|accessdate= November 25, 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this example, there are seven ranges of taxable income. Each range is taxed at a different rate and is therefore a separate tax bracket. The tax brackets in the above table are 10%, 12%, 22%, 24%, 32%, 35%, and 37%. (The tax bracket column is not present in the actual IRS table. It was added here to show the concept.)

===Marginal rate===
{{Main article|Marginal tax rate}}
Within each tax bracket, each additional dollar will impose the same amount of tax. For example, you will pay a tax of 10% if your income is $5,000 ($500 tax) or $9,000 ($900 tax).

If your Taxable income increases to $10,000, your next dollar of Taxable income is taxed at a 12% rate. This is a higher marginal rate than the 10% rate imposed for $9,000.

The marginal rate is not the total tax you pay. It only describes the ''rate'' of the tax paid for that specific amount of Taxable income.

==Calculation of the income tax==
IRS instructions require use of the tax tables, which provide the tax directly from your income, when taxable income is less than $100,000. No calculations are required. 
The following example is for illustrative purposes to show how the tax schedules work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Forum post|p=4234009|title=Re: Wiki - Progressive tax|author=HueyLD|date=Nov 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A single person has a Taxable income of $60,000 which falls within the 22% tax bracket.

The approach is to add the amount of each underlying tax bracket up to the total Taxable income and is shown graphically in the figure below.

{| style="border: 1px solid #BBB;"
||[[File:Income tax example.png|600px]]
|}

For convenience, the IRS places the sum of the underlying tax brackets in the same row as the Taxable income. The amount of $4,453.50 is the sum of the 10% and 12% brackets ($3,501.00 + $952.50).

{| class="wikitable"
|+ 2018 Federal Tax Rate, Single Person (from above)
! Taxable Income  !! Tax Rate !! Tax Bracket
|-
| $38,701 - $82,500  || $4,453.50 plus 22% of the amount over $38,700 || 22%
|}

&lt;math&gt;\text{Total tax} = $4,453.50 + 22% \times ($60,000 - $38,700) = $9,139.50&lt;/math&gt;

The manual calculation and IRS schedule results are identical ($9,139.50).

==A misconception about progressive tax==
A common misconception is that changing your tax bracket implies that your entire income is taxed at that rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Forum post|p=4229220|title=Re: How do tax brackets work?|author=Glockenspiel|date=Nov 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As demonstrated in the previous example, you are only taxed at the marginal rate for the amount of income which applies ''to that tax bracket''.

This is much lower than incorrectly calculating a tax of $13,200 (22% * $60,000) on the entire income at the 22% marginal rate.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a tax on the transfer of property by one individual to another while receiving nothing, or less than full value, in return. The tax applies whether the donor intends the transfer to be a gift or not.&lt;ref name="IRS"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/gift-tax|title=Gift tax|publisher= Internal Revenue Service |accessdate=July 29, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Contrary to popular belief, '''in most cases, no actual tax payment is due when making a gift subject to gift tax.''' Rather, gifts subject to gift tax reduce your lifetime [[Estate and inheritance tax|estate tax exemption]]. In this way, gift tax and estate tax are part of the same tax system. Due to the high federal estate tax exemption - $13.99&amp;nbsp;million in 2025 and $15&amp;nbsp;million in 2026, and double these amounts for married couples - very few people will end up paying any gift tax. Most gifts under the annual gift tax exclusion - $19,000 per recipient per year in 2025 and 2026 - are not reportable or subject to gift tax.

==How the gift tax works==

Whenever you make a gift that is [[#What_can_be_excluded_from_gifts|not excluded]] and therefore taxable, you are required to file a United States Gift (and Generation-Skipping Transfer) Tax Return ([https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f709.pdf IRS Form 709]) for that year. When you do, your lifetime estate tax exemption will be reduced by the taxable amount of the gift.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= Erin Gobler|url=https://www.thebalance.com/gift-tax-exclusion-annual-exclusion-vs-lifetime-exemption-3505656|title=Gift Tax Rate: How Much Is It and Who Pays It?|publisher=The Balance|date=August 29, 2024|accessdate=July 29, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''You will not owe any gift tax at that time,''' except in the unlikely case that you have already used up your entire lifetime exemption with prior gifts. If you have used up your lifetime exemption and make further taxable gifts, you (the donor) are responsible for paying the gift tax when you file the gift tax return. Recipients are not responsible for filing a gift tax return or paying gift tax. Gifts do not count as taxable income to the recipient, nor are they income tax-deductible to the donor (except for charitable contributions). 

Gift tax and [[Estate and inheritance tax|estate tax]] are part of the same tax system. When you die, you will be taxed on your estate to the extent it exceeds whatever is remaining of your lifetime exemption after subtracting out prior taxable gifts. The gift tax exists so people can't avoid the estate tax by giving away their assets before they die.

==What counts as a gift?==

The gift tax applies to the transfer by gift of any property. You make a gift if you give property (including money), or the use of or income from property, without expecting to receive something of at least equal value in return. The following actions (not an exhaustive list) count as gifts, even though it may not be so obvious for some:

*Giving money, cash-equivalent items (for example, gift cards), tangible property, or securities&lt;ref group="note"&gt;If you give someone an appreciated security, they "inherit" the same basis as you had for purposes of capital gains, and so may owe capital gains tax when they sell it. If they sell for a loss, their cost basis for capital gains tax is the lower of your basis or the fair market value at the time of the gift. This rule stops you from giving property with a loss to a relative who would get a larger tax benefit from the loss than you would.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Paying bills or expenses on someone else's behalf (but note that tuition or medical expenses you pay on someone's behalf, made directly to the school or provider, are [[#What_can_be_excluded_from_gifts?|excluded]])
*Selling property for less than fair market value
*Allowing use of property (for example, apartment or vacation home) for free or less than fair market value
*Lending money interest-free or at a below-market interest rate
*Forgiving a loan
*Contributing money into a trust where someone else is the beneficiary
*Changing the beneficiary of a trust or [[529 plan|529 account]]

Just because the fair market value of a gift may be difficult to determine, that does not mean the gift is not taxable or a gift tax return does not need to be filed. You are required to do your best to estimate the fair market value of any gifts you give.

==What can be excluded from gifts?==

The general rule is that any gift is a taxable gift. However, there are many exceptions to this rule. Generally, the following gifts are not taxable gifts.&lt;ref name="IRSfaq"&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/frequently-asked-questions-on-gift-taxes|title=Frequently Asked Questions on Gift Taxes|publisher= Internal Revenue Service |accessdate=March 2, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

*Gifts that are not more than the [[#Annual_exclusion|annual exclusion]] (per recipient) for the calendar year
*Tuition or medical expenses you pay for someone, made directly to the educational institution or medical provider
*Gifts to a US citizen spouse.{{#tag:ref|Where a gift is made to a spouse who is not a United States citizen, the unlimited marital deduction is disallowed, and instead replaced with a limited deduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/2523| title=26 U.S. Code § 2523 - Gift to spouse| at=Code § 2523(i)| publisher=Cornell Law School| accessdate=October 23, 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group="note"}}
*Gifts to a political organization for its use
*Donations to qualifying charities&lt;ref name="IRSfaq" /&gt;

==Annual exclusion==

As noted in the previous section, gifts under the annual exclusion amount are not a taxable gift. The annual exclusion amount is $19,000 in 2025.&lt;ref name="IRSexclusion"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-releases-tax-inflation-adjustments-for-tax-year-2025| title=IRS releases tax inflation adjustments for tax year 2025 | publisher=IRS| accessdate=July 9, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt; Married couples are each entitled to give away the annual exclusion amount, so the total exclusion for a couple is $38,000.&lt;ref name="IRSexclusion" /&gt; 

This limit is '''per recipient''' - that is, you can give up to the annual exclusion to as many recipients as you like and not have to file a gift tax return. However, when you give a gift more than the annual exclusion, your lifetime estate tax exemption is reduced by the amount above the exclusion. 

===Present interest===

To be granted the annual exclusion, a gift must be a ''present interest''. A gift is considered a ''present interest'' if the donee has all immediate rights to the use, possession, and enjoyment of the property or income from the property.&lt;ref name="IRS709" /&gt; A gift of a ''future interest'' gets no annual exclusion. A gift is considered a ''future interest'' if the donee's rights to the use, possession, and enjoyment of the property or income from the property will not begin until some future date. Future interests include reversions, remainders, and other similar interests or estates.&lt;ref name="IRS709" /&gt;

A [[Trusts#Crummey_trusts|Crummey provision]] is sometimes added to a trust, whereby the beneficiary has the option to withdraw a contribution for a limited time, so that the contribution qualifies as a present interest and is thus granted an annual exclusion.

==Avoiding gift tax==

If you are wishing to make a large gift, you may wonder how far out of your way you should go to structure the gift such that you don't have to file a gift tax return. The answer depends partly on how likely you are to pay estate tax. The estate tax exemption is very high - $13.99&amp;nbsp;million in 2025, and $15&amp;nbsp;million in 2026, indexed for inflation each year thereafter, and double for married couples. If there's a reasonable chance you will pay estate tax, it would be prudent to try to avoid filing a gift tax return if practical, as the estate tax rate is high (40%). For example, if you wish to give a gift of $30,000 in December, you could instead give $19,000 in December and the remaining $11,000 in early January. If you are married, both you and your spouse can give, for a combined annual exclusion of $38,000. If the recipient is married, you can give to their spouse too, so if both you and the recipient are married, you can give up to $76,000 per year tax-free. You can also choose to give to the recipient's children or other relatives, or pay their tuition or medical expenses. With some forethought and planning, it's possible to give quite a bit of money away each year without triggering gift tax.

If your chance of ever owing estate tax is low, the choice of whether to avoid the gift tax is more one of paperwork. Filing [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f709.pdf Form 709] is not complicated, but it will take you some time to figure it out, or you can pay an accountant to file it for you. If it would be easy to structure the gift as to avoid a gift tax filing, that would be a good choice. But if not, filing a gift tax return is not a big deal and will very likely not ever cost you any taxes.

==Tax return filing==

The donor is responsible for paying the gift tax. However, if the donor does not pay the tax, the person receiving the gift may have to pay the tax.&lt;ref name="IRS709"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i709.pdf|title=Instructions for Form 709|publisher= Internal Revenue Service |accessdate=January 27, 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tax returns are only needed if the gift exceeds the exclusion amount.

Use [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f709.pdf Form 709] to report the following:&lt;ref name="IRS709" /&gt;
*Transfers subject to the federal gift and certain generation-skipping transfer (GST) taxes and to figure the tax due, if any, on those transfers.
*Allocation of the lifetime GST exemption to property transferred during the transferor's lifetime.

All gift and GST taxes must be figured and filed on a calendar year basis.&lt;ref name="IRS709" /&gt;
*List all reportable gifts made during the calendar year on one Form 709. This means you must file a separate return for each calendar year a reportable gift is given (for example, a gift given in 2018 must be reported on a 2018 Form 709).
*Do not file more than one Form 709 for any one calendar year.

Additional information:&lt;ref name="IRS709" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/wealth-management-insights/gift-splitting|title=Planning strategies for gift splitting|publisher=Fidelity Private Wealth Management |accessdate=July 31, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Spouses may not file a joint gift tax return. Each individual is responsible for their own Form 709.
*Gifts of community property are considered to be made one-half by each spouse.
*You must file a gift tax return to split gifts with your spouse (regardless of their amount), but your spouse does not have to file if either
*#only you made any gifts and the total was less than twice the annual exclusion, or
*#only you made any gifts with a total of more than the annual exclusion and less than twice the annual exclusion, and your spouse made gifts under the annual exclusion to another party.
*Likewise, each spouse must file a gift tax return if they have made a gift of property held by them as joint tenants or tenants by the entirety.
*Only individuals are required to file gift tax returns. If a trust, estate, partnership, or corporation makes a gift, the individual beneficiaries, partners, or stockholders are considered donors and may be liable for the gift and GST taxes.

If you are a citizen or resident of the United States, you must file a gift tax return if it meets the situations described in the [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i709.pdf Form 709 Instructions]. See the instructions for additional filing information and rate schedules.&lt;ref name="IRSforms"&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/forms-and-publications-estate-and-gift-tax|title=Forms and Publications - Estate and Gift Tax|publisher= Internal Revenue Service|date= |accessdate=March 2, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonresidents not citizens of the United States are subject to gift and GST taxes for gifts of tangible property situated in the United States.&lt;ref name="IRS709" /&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;A person is considered a nonresident not a citizen of the United States if, at the time the gift is made, they (1) were not a citizen of the United States and did not reside there, or (2) were domiciled in a U.S. possession and acquired citizenship solely by reason of birth or residence in the possession.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Examples of filing requirements===

The following examples assume an annual gift exclusion of $19,000.

Harold and Winifred are married. Harold gave $38,000 to his daughter from a previous marriage. If Winifred does not consent to spitting gifts, Harold is required to file a gift tax return, but Winifred is not.

Harold and Winifred are married. Harold gave $38,000 to his daughter from a previous marriage. If Winifred consents to spitting gifts, Harold must file a gift tax return, and Winifred must give her consent on his return, but does not have to file her own return. If the gift had been $40,000, both would have had to file a return.

Harold and Winifred are married. Harold gave $19,000 to his daughter from a previous marriage and $19,000 to Winifred in 2021. If Winifred gives $19,000 to Harold’s daughter from a previous marriage or anyone else, neither Harold nor Winifred is required to file a return.

Hal and Wendy live in a community property state. Wendy gave $38,000 of community property to her son from a previous marriage. Neither Wendy nor Hal is required to file a gift tax return since each is considered to have made a gift of $19,000.

Hal and Wendy live in a community property state. Wendy gave $30,000 of community property and $4,000 of her separate property to her son from a previous marriage. Wendy’s gift is considered to be $15,000 plus $4,000, and Hal’s gift is considered to be $10,000, so no gift tax returns are required. If Wendy had given $31,000 of community property and $4,000 of her separate property to her son from a previous marriage, Wendy would have to file a gift tax return, but Hal would not.

==State gift taxes==

As of 2025, seventeen states have a [[Estate_and_inheritance_tax#State_estate_and_inheritance_taxes|state estate and/or inheritance tax]]. States vary in how they handle gift tax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wealthspire.com/guides-whitepapers/federal-state-estate-gift-tax/|title=2025 Federal &amp; State Estate and Gift Tax Cheat Sheet|publisher=Wealthspire Advisors|date=February 4, 2025|accessdate=July 29, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some states have no gift tax, meaning that you could give away all your assets (or at least enough to get below the state's estate tax exemption) before you die as a way to avoid the state's estate tax.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Doing so may cost your heirs capital gains tax, however, as they would lose the [[step-up in basis]] on any gifted appreciated investments.&lt;/ref&gt; Other states conform to federal gift tax rules, while others treat gifts made within a certain time period prior to death part of the decedent's taxable estate. If you may owe state estate and/or inheritance tax, make sure you understand your state's gift tax rules.

A '''taxable account''' is one where the normal IRS tax rules apply. In a taxable account, you pay taxes on interest, dividends, and capital gains, in the year in which you earn them. Checking accounts, savings accounts, [[Money markets|money market]] accounts, and brokerage accounts are all taxable accounts.

Taxable accounts have none of the special tax rules that ''tax-advantaged'' accounts have. [[401(k)|401(k)s]], [[Traditional IRA|IRAs]], [[403(b)|403(b)s]], [[Health savings account|Health Savings Accounts]] (HSAs), and [[529 plan|529 plans]] are all tax-advantaged accounts. However, unlike tax-advantaged accounts, taxable accounts do not have restrictions on contributions or withdrawals.

==Taxable account basics==

The overall tax rules for taxable accounts are:
* You make taxable investments with after-tax money
* You pay tax on interest and dividends that your investments generate, and on any capital gains you realize, in the year in which they occur.
** The tax on these is at either your ordinary income tax rate (for interest, [[non-qualified dividends]], and short-term capital gains), or at a reduced rate for long-term capital gains and [[Qualified dividend|qualified dividends]].
* When you sell an investment, you pay tax on the difference between your sale price and your [[Cost basis methods|cost basis]] (effectively, what you paid for the investment).
** The tax on these is at either a short-term capital gains rate (if held for one year or less) or long-term capital gains rate (if held for longer than one year). 
* Taxable accounts have no contribution or income limitations, and no withdrawal restrictions.

Some cases where you might use a taxable account:
* Saving for when you need the money sooner than you could take it from your retirement accounts. Examples include [[Emergency fund|emergency funds]], and saving for a car, house down payment, or other large purchase.
* Saving for retirement when you want to save more than the contribution limits for tax-advantaged retirement accounts.
* Holding investments that are not available in your tax-advantaged accounts.

==Details==

You pay tax on earnings from a taxable account in the year in which you earn them. This section looks at the tax treatment of different kinds of earnings in a taxable account.

Regardless of the type of earnings, you treat all taxable account earnings as investment income. However, your tax on investment income is different from that for employment income in a few areas:
* You do not pay [[Payroll tax|payroll taxes]] (Social Security Tax, Medicare Tax, or the Additional Medicare Tax) on investment income.
* You may have to pay the [[ACA net investment income tax|Net Investment Income Tax]] on investment income.

===Interest===

You pay tax on interest, for example earned from a savings account or money market, as ordinary income in the year you receive it. Interest has no preferential tax treatment.

Payers usually report your interest payments on IRS [https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-1099-int Form 1099-INT].

===Bond interest and coupons===

You normally pay tax on [[Bond basics|bond]] interest (coupons) as interest, although some types of government-issued bonds pay interest that is exempt from certain taxes:
* Corporate bond interest is fully taxable.
* You pay full federal tax on federal government bond interest ([[United States Treasury security|Treasury notes]], I-Bonds, [[TIPS]], and so on), but this is typically exempt from state income tax.
* [[Municipal bonds|Municipal bond]] (issued by state and local governments) interest is typically exempt from both federal taxes, and state taxes in the state that issued the bonds; although exceptions exist, so you need to carefully check your state's tax rules.

===Dividends===

[[Dividend|Dividends]] are payments a business makes to its shareholders (owners). If you hold shares of stock in a taxable account, you will receive dividends when the stock pays out dividends.

You pay tax on dividends that meet the requirements for [[Qualified dividend | qualified dividends]] at long-term capital gains tax rates. These are lower than for ordinary income. Dividends that do not meet these requirements are called [[non-qualified dividends]], and you pay tax on them at ordinary income rates.

Payers report your dividends on IRS [https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-1099-div Form 1099-DIV].

===Capital gains and losses===

When you sell an investment for more than its ''[[Cost basis methods|cost basis]]'' (typically, what you paid for it, although sometimes the IRS requires you to adjust this), your profit on the investment is taxable income in the year the investment was sold.

Generally, if you held it for more than one year, you pay tax on the gain at reduced long-term capital gains tax rates. If you held it for one year or less, you pay tax on the gain as ordinary income. You only pay tax on the part of the sale price that is your gain. You do not pay tax on the part of your sale price that is your ''cost basis'' (typically the amount you originally invested).

When you sell an investment for less than its cost basis (that is, at a loss), your loss is generally tax-deductible. If you held the investment for more than a year, you first use the loss to offset long-term capital gains on your other investment sales, then offset short-term gains, and finally you can use up to $3,000 of remaining loss to offset earned income. You carry over losses above the $3,000 limit to future years, and you can use them then. This is called ''capital loss carryover.''

Typically, payers report your capital gains and losses on IRS [https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-1099-b Form 1099-B].

===Distributions===
{{Main|Capital gains distribution}}

If you hold a [[Mutual fund|mutual fund]] or [[Exchange-traded fund]] (ETF) in a taxable account, the fund pays you any interest, dividends, and capital gains earned inside it. You may see capital gains reported on a 1099 form at the end of the year, even if you did not sell any shares of the mutual fund or ETF.

===Step-up in basis===

The cost basis of investments "[[Step-up in basis|steps up]]" to equal the value of the security when inherited after the owner's death. For example, if your uncle owned shares of a stock worth $100,000 with a basis of $20,000 (what he originally paid for it, plus any reinvested dividends), and you inherit these when he dies, your basis becomes $100,000 on the day you inherit the stock. If you sell the stock immediately for $100,000, you receive the full value and pay no tax. If your uncle had sold the stock the day before he died, he would pay capital gains tax on the $80,000 gain.

It is possible to gift taxable investments while alive. In this case, the recipient "inherits" the same basis as you had for purposes of gains. So if you receive a gift of investments with unrealized capital gains, selling them will mean you have to pay capital gains tax. If you sell for a loss, your cost basis for tax is the lower of your basis or the fair market value at the time of the gift. (This rule stops you from giving property with a loss to a relative who would get a larger tax benefit from the loss than you would.)

===Foreign tax credit===
{{Main|Foreign tax credit}}

International investments sometimes have to pay taxes in foreign countries, and when they do, Form 1099-DIV will show you the amount. Although there are some limitations, to avoid double tax you can take either a credit or deduction for foreign taxes. A tax credit is usually the better choice.

==Taxable account investing strategy==

In Traditional and Roth retirement accounts, your results depend only on the return from the investments you hold in them. Investing in a taxable account is considerably more difficult. Complex tax rules, the [[SEC Yield|yield]] (returns that are paid out from the investment as opposed to retained as an increase in value), and tracking your cost basis all cause complications.

'''Tax efficiency''' means minimizing your taxes over your entire portfolio by optimizing around tax laws. This section describes various strategies that minimize taxes and maximize your returns in taxable accounts.

===Tax-efficient funds and fund placement===
{{Main|Tax-efficient fund placement}}

Prefer minimal yield on taxable investments, for a given level of return. Lower yield improves your investment performance in several ways:
* Taxes that you would pay on dividends and capital gains stay in the investment, and this helps with compound growth.
* Growth in the form of price appreciation, rather than as yield, gives you control over when to realize this gain. For example, you could sell appreciated investments in low-income years to reduce your tax. You pay taxes on yield in the year you earn it, even if your tax rate is high in that year.
* You pay taxes on investments you hold for longer than one year at lower long-term capital gains rates, but you pay tax on yield at higher ordinary income tax rates.

Passive stock funds, such as [[index fund |index funds]] have an inbuilt tax efficiency that gives them an enormous advantage over actively-managed stock funds inside a taxable account. By design, passive funds buy and hold a set of stocks, and trades within the fund are rare (for example, to track the index as the market capitalization of the constituent stocks fluctuates). This means that a passive fund generates far lower capital gains than an active fund, and that any capital gain tends to be long-term. If the stocks pay dividends, those dividends are unavoidably passed to the fund owners, but even then, dividends are far more likely to meet the holding period requirement for [[Qualified dividend|qualified dividends]] and receive preferential tax treatment. 

[[ETF|Exchange-traded funds]] are often more tax-efficient than mutual funds (see also: [[ETFs vs mutual funds]]), although passive funds are already more tax-efficient than active funds, so the difference is smaller. Vanguard is a special case; both their ETFs and mutual funds have the same tax efficiency.

Several investment companies, including Vanguard, offer [[Tax-managed fund comparison|tax-managed funds]] specifically for taxable accounts. They design these for maximum tax efficiency, although at the cost of slightly higher expenses. Compared to low-expense non-tax-managed passive funds, which are already very efficient, the difference is small. If you have a very high [[Marginal tax rate|marginal tax rate]], tax-managed funds can offer an advantage in after-tax performance. However if you are in a lower bracket, the lower expenses of the normal funds will probably outweigh the tax efficiency of tax-managed funds, making normal funds the better choice.

[[Bond basics|Bonds]] and bond mutual funds are inherently tax ''in''-efficient investments, because much of their return is interest, and you pay tax on this as ordinary income in the year in which you earn it. For best tax efficiency you might want to locate bonds inside tax-advantaged accounts. However, bonds tend to be lower-return assets in most portfolios, and by putting those assets inside tax-advantaged accounts, you reduce your future tax-advantaged space.

For more on where to hold bonds, see [[Tax-efficient fund placement]]. 

===Tax-free investments===

Some investments, such as [[municipal bonds]], are exempt from federal tax, or state tax, or both. For investments in a taxable account, your [[Marginal tax rate#After-tax value|after-tax return]] is what matters. If you have a high [[Marginal tax rate|marginal tax rate]], you could see a significant benefit to your after-tax returns if you choose tax-free investments.

However, tax-free investments tend to deliver lower returns, so if you are in a lower tax bracket, you may see higher after-tax returns with fully taxable investments such as [[Corporate bonds|corporate bonds]], despite the higher tax cost. Also, for this reason it is usually not a good idea to use tax-free investments in tax-deferred or tax-free accounts such as [[401(k)|401(k)s]] and [[Traditional IRA|IRAs]].

While you do not directly pay tax on returns from tax-free investments, they are taken into account when phasing in [[Taxation of Social Security benefits|taxation of Social Security benefits]], and so they can have substantial tax consequences.

===Tax loss harvesting===
{{Main|Tax loss harvesting}}

''Tax loss harvesting'' means selling investments that have lost value relative to their basis, specifically so that you reduce your taxes. There are three ways that selling investments at a loss can save you tax:
* When you deduct the loss now and receive a tax deduction from the IRS, you effectively get an interest-free loan from the government. You can invest the taxes you save saved to generate future returns. The ability to deduct up to $3,000 of losses annually from earned income adds to your tax saving.
* Long-term capital gains tax rates are lower than ordinary income tax rates, so that you effectively swap a higher tax rate for a lower one if your losses offset short-term gains or ordinary income, but you can realize these as long-term gains.
* If you later [[Donating appreciated securities|donate appreciated assets]] to charity, or [[Step-up in basis|leave them to heirs]], they avoid capital gains taxes entirely.

In most cases, harvesting losses improves long-term performance, so consider harvesting your losses as soon as they occur. In rare cases, it may not be a good idea to harvest losses, for example if you know that your future tax rates will be much higher than today, or if your losses would offset gains that you would otherwise not pay tax on anyway.

When you harvest losses you need to pay attention to the [[Wash sale|wash sale rule]]. This disallows a tax deduction for your losses if you buy a "substantially identical" security within 30 days of the sale.

Frustratingly, the IRS has never defined "substantially identical", but it ''may'' include different mutual funds that track the same index, and different share classes of the same mutual fund or ETF. It would ''not'' include funds that track different sets of stocks, for example the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund (VTSAX) and the Vanguard S&amp;P 500 Index Fund (VFIAX), even though these two funds might have very high market correlation.

===Tax gain harvesting===
{{Main|Tax gain harvesting}}

Generally, keeping your investment gains give you better long-term performance, because the tax that you would otherwise pay compounds in your account, and because you might later [[Donating appreciated securities|donate to charity]] or get a [[Step-up in basis|step-up in basis]] at death. [[Tax gain harvesting]] is a much less common strategy than tax loss harvesting.

However, harvesting gains can make sense in some cases, perhaps if you are confident that your tax rates will be higher in the future, and you know you will want to sell the investment. Harvesting gains at a rate of 0% is usually a good idea, as long as the additional taxable income does not cause you unwanted tax consequences. There is no [[Wash sale|wash sale rule]] for tax gain harvesting.

===Low-basis investments===

Investors commonly have to deal with investments with a low cost basis (large unrealized capital gains). A large unrealized capital gain in an investment creates a large disincentive to sell.

This commonly happens when someone learns more about the [[Bogleheads investment philosophy]] and decides they no longer want to hold individual stocks in their taxable account, but these stocks have large unrealized gains. For any low-basis investment, there are three ways to dispose of it:
* Liquidate it and pay the tax cost. You could spread the sale across multiple years if the capital gains tax on the lump-sum would push you into a higher [[Marginal tax rate|marginal tax rate]] than for smaller gains, for example by triggering the [[ACA net investment income tax|Net Investment Income Tax (NIIT)]].
* Continue to hold it, and plan to either sell it at a future time when the taxes may be lower, or leave it as part of your [[Estate planning|estate]].
* [[Donating appreciated securities|Donate it to a charity]], avoiding the tax cost for both you and the charity and allowing you to deduct the full value of the investment.

Your best strategy depends on several factors, such as your current and expected tax rates, your need for cash, plans for charitable giving, your age and health, performance and risk level of the investment in question, and how well or poorly the investment fits into your [[Investment policy statement|investing plan]]. See also: [[Paying a tax cost to switch funds]]

Low-basis investments makes [[rebalancing]] challenging. Trading in a taxable account creates added tax drag and lowers long-term performance, so avoid it when possible. One way to rebalance is to trade only in tax-advantaged accounts, such as [[401(k)|401(k)s]] and [[Traditional IRA|IRAs]], balancing these against your taxable account. You can trade without any tax consequences in both Traditional and Roth retirement account. This means that you can often rebalancing without selling low-basis investments using a combination of new investments and trading within tax-advantaged accounts.

To restructure larger investments, you need to compare the benefit of selling low-basis investments with the tax cost, using the various factors described above.

===Tax lots===
{{Main|Cost basis methods}}

Buying shares of a security at different times, and [[Reinvesting dividends in a taxable account|reinvesting dividends]], gives you different ''tax lots'' of shares, each with a different cost basis. You have a choice about how you handle multiple tax lots:
* First-in-first-out (FIFO) method: Oldest shares are always sold first.
* Specific identification of shares: The brokerage identifies each tax lot of shares with its own cost basis.
* Average cost method: The IRS allows you to use an average cost method, where each sale has the average cost basis of all tax lots. Once you start using the average cost method, you have use it for all future transactions of that security, until you have sold all of its shares.

There is no single best cost basis method. Specific identification of shares gives you the most control, but can mean you have to track a large number of tax lots, particularly if your provider automatically reinvests your dividends.

Depending on your goals, it may be worthwhile to sell older or lower-basis investments first, for the lower tax rates on long-term capital gains. Or, it may be best to sell more recently-purchased higher-basis shares, to minimize realized capital gains and preserve lower-basis shares. 

Some brokerages offer more complex cost basis methods that try to optimize around tax laws. These tools may streamline trading, but make sure you understand the procedure before you use them, to make sure you are using the methods that work best for your situation.

==Performance==

Because the tax rules for taxable accounts are more complex than for retirement accounts, so is calculating the performance. You can use following formulas if you want to calculate future taxable account values from rate of return and other parameters.

This analysis assumes that all [[Reinvesting dividends in a taxable account|dividends are reinvested]] and all taxes are paid from the dividends. While dividend reinvestment is not always desirable, it makes it possible to directly compare performance in taxable accounts to the performance of tax-advantaged accounts.

Evaluating the performance of investments that have dividends periodically removed from the value, or that have dividend taxes paid from external sources, is more difficult than the method shown below, and would require discounted cash flow analysis. 

The following table summarizes the formulas for the pre-tax value &lt;math&gt;V(t)&lt;/math&gt;, basis &lt;math&gt;B(t)&lt;/math&gt;, and after-tax value &lt;math&gt;V_{at}(t)&lt;/math&gt;, for periodic (for example, annual) or continuous compounding:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Periodic (for example, annual) compounding !! Continuous compounding
|-
| &lt;math&gt;V(t) = V(0) \cdot (1+r-y \cdot tr_{div})^t&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;V(t) = V(0) \cdot e^{(r-y \cdot tr_{div})t}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;B(t) = B(0) + \left ( \frac{V(0) \cdot y \cdot (1-tr_{div})}{r-y \cdot tr_{div}} \right ) \left ( (1+r-y \cdot tr_{div})^t-1 \right )&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;B(t) = B(0) + \left ( \frac{V(0) \cdot y \cdot (1-tr_{div})}{r-y \cdot tr_{div}} \right ) \left ( e^{(r-y \cdot tr_{div})t}-1 \right )&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;V_{at}(t) = V(t) - \left ( V(t) - B(t) \right ) \cdot tr_{cg}&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;V_{at}(t) = V(t) - \left ( V(t) - B(t) \right ) \cdot tr_{cg}&lt;/math&gt;
|}

These formulas are derived [[Tax analysis|here]]. When analyzing a periodic compounding investment, make sure the period on the rates of growth matches the compounding period. For example, a monthly compounding investment with an annual rate of return of 8% and a yield of 2% would have a periodic return of ~0.667% (8% / 12) and a periodic yield of ~0.167% (2% / 12). Time should also have the units of number of compounding periods, for example, number of months. 

====Example====

You invest $10,000 in a mutual fund in a taxable account and plan to sell it after 25 years. Your federal tax rates are 24% on ordinary income and 15% on qualified dividends on long-term capital gains. In addition, your state charges a 9.3% tax on all forms of income, and you do not itemize your state income taxes on your federal return. 

You plan to move to a tax-free state, and you will pay a 15% long-term capital gains tax rate when the investment is sold. The mutual fund has an expected return of 9% and a yield of 2%, compounding annually. The yield is comprised of 90% long-term capital gains (paid within the fund and passed to you) and qualified dividends, and 10% short-term capital gains and [[Non-qualified dividends|non-qualified dividends]]. 

What is your expected after-tax value when the mutual fund is sold? Your effective tax rates are:

&lt;math&gt;tr_{div} = (15%+9.3%) \cdot 90% + (24%+9.3%) \cdot 10% = 25.2%&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;tr_{cg} = 15%&lt;/math&gt;

Your future balance is:

&lt;math&gt;V(25) = $10,000 \cdot (1+9%-(2% \cdot 25.2%))^{25} = $76,796.81&lt;/math&gt;

Your future basis is:

&lt;math&gt;B(25) = $10,000 + \left ( \frac{$10,000 \cdot 2% \cdot (1-25.2%)}{9%-(2% \cdot 25.2%)} \right ) \left ( (1+9%-(2% \cdot 25.2%))^{25}-1 \right ) = $21,761.77&lt;/math&gt;

After the fund is sold, your after-tax value will be:

&lt;math&gt;V_{at}(25) = $76,796.81 - \left ( $76,796.81 - $21,761.77 \right ) \cdot 15% = $68,541.55&lt;/math&gt;

===Comparison to traditional and Roth accounts===

In almost all cases, your taxes will be lower for investments inside traditional and Roth retirement accounts (401(k)s, IRAs, and so on) than for taxable accounts. A Roth retirement account has the same performance as a taxable account, but with no dividend and capital gains tax, and so its performance will always be equal to or higher than a taxable account.

Under the same conditions as the above example, an investment in a Roth account would be worth $86,230.81 ($10,000 * (1 + 9%)^25), about 26% more than the same investment in a taxable account. A traditional retirement account is similar to a Roth, except that you pay taxes when you withdraw the funds rather than when you invest them as after-tax income.

For these reasons, almost everybody should contribute retirement savings to traditional and Roth retirement accounts first. Use taxable accounts for retirement savings only if you want to invest more than the contribution limits on retirement accounts. Also, consider less widely known retirement account options, such as catch-up contributions, the [[Backdoor Roth|Backdoor Roth IRA]], the [[Mega-backdoor Roth]], and the [[IRA#Other IRA terminology|Spousal IRA]], before saving retirement funds in a taxable account. 

If you do use a taxable account for retirement savings, for good long-term performance it is critical that you hold low-cost tax-efficient investments.

===Comparison to non-deductible IRAs and variable annuities===

[[Non-deductible traditional IRA|Non-deductible traditional IRAs]] and [[Variable annuity|variable annuities]] have a similar tax structure: you contribute after-tax money, tax is deferred on your investment growth, and you pay tax on the growth when you withdraw it, as ordinary income.

For tax efficient investments, taxable accounts tend to outperform these accounts. The future value of the same investment in the above example inside a non-deductible IRA or variable annuity would be $86,230.81 ($10,000 * (1 + 9%)^25) before taxes, and '''$67,935.41''' ($86,230.81 - ($86,230.81 - $10,000) * 24%) after taxes.

For tax ''in''-efficient investments, non-deductible IRAs and variable annuities may have a significant advantage over a taxable account. 

Consider the above example, but with an investment that returns 6% that is all fully taxable yield. The future taxable balance is:

&lt;math&gt;V(25) = $10,000 \cdot (1+6%-(6% \cdot 25.2%))^{25} = $29,968.18&lt;/math&gt;

The future taxable basis will be:

&lt;math&gt;B(25) = $10,000 + \left ( \frac{$10,000 \cdot 6% \cdot (1-25.2%)}{6%-(6% \cdot 25.2%)} \right ) \left ( (1+6%-(6% \cdot 25.2%))^{25}-1 \right ) = $29,968.18&lt;/math&gt;

This makes sense. Because the growth is entirely due to yield, the future value and future basis are equal. This also means there is no capital gains tax to pay, so the future value is after-tax. The future value of a non-deductible IRA or variable annuity is:

&lt;math&gt;$10,000 \cdot (1+6%)^{25} = $42,918.71&lt;/math&gt;

After taxes, the value will be:

&lt;math&gt;V_{at}(25) = $42,918.71 - \left ( $42,918.71 - $10,000 \right ) \cdot 24% = $35,018.22&lt;/math&gt;

However, if you hold variable annuities, you need to compare the fees and liquidity issues against the tax advantages. Variable annuities typically have fees of 0.5-1%+ per year, and when subtracting these fees from the returns, the annuity performance is not nearly as good.

In the above example, the annuity would slightly outperform the taxable account with a fee of 0.5%, but under-perform with a fee of 1%. Annuities also typically have surrender fees for early withdrawal, and the IRS also applies an early withdrawal penalty for withdrawals before age 59.5.

Non-deductible traditional IRAs also have early withdrawal penalties and contribution limits, although low-fee IRAs are much easier to find. However, almost everybody should have access to a Roth IRA (which is strictly better than a non-deductible traditional IRA) due to the [[Backdoor Roth|Backdoor Roth IRA]]. For rare cases where a non-deductible traditional IRA make sense, see [[Non-deductible_traditional_IRA#Appropriate_uses|Appropriate uses]].

'''{{PAGENAME}}''', also known as '''FICA''' (Federal Insurance Contributions Act)&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ssa.gov/thirdparty/materials/pdfs/educators/What-is-FICA-Infographic-EN-05-10297.pdf What is FICA?], Social Security Administration (SSA)&lt;/ref&gt; or '''FICA tax''', is a tax in the United States against [[Earned income|earned income]].

It has three components: [[Social Security]] tax on earned income up to the Social Security Wage Base ($176,100 in 2025); [[Medicare]] tax on all earned income; and the Additional Medicare Tax on earned income above $200,000 for single taxpayers or $250,000 for married couples (implemented by the [[wikipedia:Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] (ACA)).

The employee and employer share the Social Security tax and Medicare tax. Each pays half the tax, and the employer must withhold the employee's half of these two taxes from the employee's paychecks.

The employee pays any Additional Medicare Tax entirely, although employers are required to withhold the Additional Medicare Tax on all wages over $200,000, without regard to the employee's filing status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/questions-and-answers-for-the-additional-medicare-tax| title=Additional Medicare Tax Withholding| publisher=IRS| access-date=October 1, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Details:
* Payroll taxes are assessed against [[Earned income|earned income]] (also called '''wages''') only. Investment income (interest, dividends, and so on ), real estate income reported on [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1040se.pdf IRS Schedule E], and income from Partnerships or S Corporations reported on [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1065sk1.pdf IRS Schedule K-1 (Form 1065)] or [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1120ssk.pdf IRS Schedule K-1 (Form 1120S)], is not assessed payroll tax.
* Contributions to Traditional [[401(k)|401(k)'s]] and [[Traditional IRA|IRAs]] are ''not'' payroll tax-deductible, only income tax-deductible.
* Contributions to [[Payroll - cafeteria plan deductions|employer cafeteria plans]], such as [[Health savings account|Health Savings Accounts (HSAs)]] and health insurance ''are'' payroll tax-deductible.  The same type of contribution made outside those plans (e.g., directly to the HSA provider, or premiums for non-employer-provided health insurance) are ''not'' payroll tax-deductible.
* Employers are required to withhold the employee's half of Social Security and Medicare tax from their paychecks.
* Employers are also required to withhold the Additional Medicare Tax on all wages over $200,000 per year, regardless of the employee's filing status.
* Self-employed sole proprietors&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/sole-proprietorships IRS information on Sole Proprietorships], IRS&lt;/ref&gt; are required to pay both halves of the payroll tax, calculated on [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1040sse.pdf IRS Schedule SE (Form 1040)]. On the Schedule SE, net business profits are scaled down by a factor of 92.35%, so that the sole proprietorship gets to deduct the employer half of payroll taxes, similar to a corporation. 
* S Corporation owners are also required to pay both halves of the payroll tax, although they have the option to split compensation between wages and dividends, within certain restrictions, potentially reducing payroll tax (see [[#Avoiding payroll tax|below]]).
* The Social Security Wage Base is adjusted annually by the Social Security Administration. Over the last several years, the figure has been increased by 3-4%/year, except for a 9.0% increase in 2023 due to high inflation.
* The income thresholds for the Additional Medicare Tax ($200,000 for single filers and $250,000 for married joint filers) are not indexed for inflation.

==Exemptions from paying payroll tax==

Generally, you are not allowed to "opt out" of paying payroll taxes, even if you are willing to forgo future Social Security and Medicare benefits. However, certain types of jobs are exempt from payroll taxes, such as:

* Children under age 18 employed by their parents through a sole proprietorship or partnership, but not a corporation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/family-help| title=Family Help| publisher=IRS| access-date=October 1, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Certain international workers within the United States, such as nonresident alien employees of foreign governments, students, and employees of international organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/foreign-student-liability-for-social-security-and-medicare-taxes| title=Foreign Student Liability for Social Security and Medicare Taxes| publisher=IRS| access-date=October 1, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Full-time students employed by their university
* Members of certain exempt religious organizations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/churches-religious-organizations/elective-fica-exemption-churches-and-church-controlled-organizations| title=Elective FICA Exemption Churches and Church Controlled Organizations| publisher=IRS| access-date=October 1, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

You must still pay Social Security tax even if you accumulate 35 years of earnings at or above the Social Security Wage Base.

==Recovering excess payroll tax==

If you are an employee and you work two or more jobs in a given year (either serially or concurrently), your employers must withhold Social Security tax from each paycheck. If your total wages are more than the Social Security Wage Base (SSWB, $184,500 in 2026), then you will have excess Social Security tax withheld. You can recover the excess Social Security tax. Enter claims for credit onto [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1040s3.pdf IRS Form 1040 Schedule 3], on Line 11 of your federal income tax return. You can either apply the credit to income tax you owe, or have it returned as part of your tax refund.  (Since this is treated as an income tax payment, you can get the credit back during the year by filing a Form W-4 to decrease withholding).

If your employer withholds excess Social Security in error, you should seek a refund from your employer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc608| title=Tax Topic 608 - Excess Social Security and RRTA Tax Withheld| publisher=IRS| access-date=October 1, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; If this is not successful, you can request a refund on [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f843.pdf IRS Form 843].

While employees are entitled to a refund for excess Social Security tax, ''employers'' are generally not entitled to a refund for their half of Social Security tax payments if the employee worked another job and overpaid. This affects business owners, and can have a particularly large impact on taxpayers who own their own business through a Corporation, and also work a second job as an employee.

The Corporation is required to pay the employer side of the Social Security tax up to the SSWB, even if the owner knows that some of this tax is on wages over the SSWB. This issue does not affect Sole Proprietors who work a second job as an employee, because [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1040sse.pdf IRS Schedule SE (Form 1040)] corrects for Social Security tax paid from other employment.

Because the Medicare tax is assessed on all earned income, working for multiple employers does not create excess Medicare tax. However, the Additional Medicare Tax can create situations of under- or over-withholding. Employers must withhold Additional Medicare Tax on employee wages above $200,000, regardless of the employee's filing status.

For example, a married employee who earns $250,000 of wages, and whose spouse does not work, will have $450 (($250,000 - $200,000) * 0.9%) of Additional Medicare Tax withheld, even though their actual Additional Medicare Tax due is $0. Conversely, a married couple who each earn $200,000 of wages will owe $1,350 (($400,000 - $250,000) * 0.9%) of Additional Medicare Tax, even though none will be withheld.

In both cases, [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f8959.pdf IRS Form 8959] corrects this on their federal return. The IRS requires this form for all federal tax returns subject to the Additional Medicare Tax.

==Avoiding payroll tax==

For most taxpayers, there are no legal ways to avoid payroll taxes. However, owners of S Corporations may decide to split their compensation partly as wages and partly as dividends from the business,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.kitces.com/blog/s-corporation-to-reduce-self-employment-taxes-and-social-security-fica/| title= Kitces - How An S Corporation Can Reduce FICA Self-Employment Taxes| publisher=Kitces| date=December 28, 2016| access-date=October 1, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; reducing payroll taxes because they are not assessed on the dividends. This split is subject to the IRS requirement for "reasonable compensation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/paying-yourself#7| title=Small Businesses - Self-employed| publisher=IRS| access-date=October 1, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even if a business owner is legally entitled to pay lower payroll taxes, there may be compelling reasons not to, such as the cost of becoming and remaining incorporated (compared to operating as a Sole Proprietor), lower employer contributions to a [[Solo 401(k) plan|Solo 401(k)]], and a potentially desirable [[Social Security as an investment|rate of return on Social Security tax paid]].

You can also avoid payroll tax when contributing to a [[Health savings account|Health Savings Account]] through an employer payroll deduction. If the [[Social Security as an investment|investment characteristics of Social Security tax]] (for example, rate of return) are desirable, you can make the payment directly to the HSA custodian.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' lists a selection of US domiciled [[Exchange-traded fund|exchange-traded funds]] (ETFs) that meet UK HMRC reporting fund&lt;ref name="reporting"&gt;{{cite web| publisher=HMRC| url=https://www.gov.uk/guidance/offshore-funds-distributing-and-reporting-funds| title=Offshore funds: distributing and reporting funds| accessdate=October 17, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; requirements.

US citizens and US permanent residents (green card holders) living in the UK can hold the funds listed below without running into problems with the US's harsh [[Passive foreign investment company]] (PFIC) tax regime, and also without running into higher UK tax because they hold HMRC non-reporting funds. The information in this article is specific to ''US citizens and US permanent residents who are UK residents''.

==Introduction==
If you are a US citizen or US permanent resident (green card holder) living in the UK, then because of the way the US's citizenship-based taxation and harsh [[Passive foreign investment company]] (PFIC) tax regime intersect, you cannot use the normal range of [[wikipedia:Undertakings_for_Collective_Investment_in_Transferable_Securities_Directive_2009|UCITS]] funds and ETFs offered to other UK and EU residents. For you, holding US domiciled funds or ETFs is one of very few viable routes to index investing.

However, the UK also has rules that discourage some "offshore" fund holdings. You would pay tax on gains in a non-UCITS fund or ETF that lacks HMRC ''reporting status''&lt;ref name="reporting" /&gt; at higher income rates, instead of lower and more beneficial capital gains rates.

Many US domiciled funds and ETFs will not have HMRC reporting status. However, some US domiciled ETFs - including most Vanguard and Dimensional ETFs - are HMRC reporting funds. This means that you can invest through these ETFs without running into either country's unpleasant tax regime for "offshore" funds.

==US domiciled ETFs with HMRC reporting status==
The following tables&lt;ref name=generator group=note&gt;These tables are built using a script to extract data from HMRC's reporting funds spreadsheet. You can find the details for this in the [[Talk:{{PAGENAME}}|discussion page]] associated with this page.&lt;/ref&gt; show a selection of US domiciled ETFs that you can safely use in taxable accounts. These are also safe to use in a UK [[UK Individual Savings Accounts|Individual Savings Account]] (ISA), although for you the ISA wrapper only provides protection from UK taxes, not from any US taxes. The US will tax your ISA gains annually as if it is a normal taxable account.

The tables show data from HMRC's [https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/offshore-funds-list-of-reporting-funds approved offshore reporting funds] list, as of 10 November 2025. This list shows funds by [[wikipedia:CUSIP|CUSIP]]. The mapping from CUSIP to fund exchange ticker uses data from [https://www.openfigi.com/ OpenFIGI], as of 10 November 2025.

If you are going to rely on the information in the tables, please first check these sources to ensure that the table data remains accurate. These tables are not an exhaustive list of all US domiciled ETFs that are HMRC reporting funds.

For completeness, you can also find a [[UK-reporting US ETFs not included in the main listing|secondary list]] of US domiciled ETFs that are HMRC reporting funds, but which will, for various reasons, be of lower interest to those following a Bogleheads-style [[Bogleheads® investment philosophy|investment philosophy]].

After [[wikipedia:Foreign_Account_Tax_Compliance_Act|FATCA]] in 2010, many UK financial institutions and brokerages started to refuse accounts for US citizens and green card holders, even those living in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| publisher=BBC| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/35383435| title=Why expat Americans are giving up their passports| accessdate=July 18, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, some US brokerages began shutting off access for US citizens and green card holders living outside the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| publisher=Creative Planning| url=https://creativeplanning.com/international/insights/why-us-brokerage-accounts-of-american-expats-are-being-closed| title=Why US Brokerage Accounts of American Expats are Being Closed| accessdate=June 11, 2023| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220820003210/https://creativeplanning.com/international/insights/why-us-brokerage-accounts-of-american-expats-are-being-closed/| archive-date=August 20, 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, the European [https://finance.ec.europa.eu/consumer-finance-and-payments/retail-financial-services/key-information-documents-packaged-retail-and-insurance-based-investment-products-priips_en PRIIPs] (''Packaged Retail and Insurance-based Investment Products'') regulation became effective. As a result it is now difficult or even impossible for EU residents to purchase US domiciled funds directly (although indirect purchases potentially remain possible&lt;ref group=note&gt;Forum member "finrod_2002" provides details of how an investor might use options trades to work around PRIIPs restrictions, in {{forum post|p=4386305|title=Re: European, dutch investor here: Is investing in VTI and VXUS still a good choice?|date=February 17, 2019}}. Viewed October 28, 2019.&lt;/ref&gt;). Shares purchased before the regulation came into effect can be kept and sold, but EU residents can generally no longer buy new shares of these funds or ETFs. The UK left the EU in January 2020, but created its own 'UK PRIIPs' regime that is fully aligned with the EU PRIIPs, so PRIIPs restrictions continue to apply in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/draft-packaged-retail-and-insurance-based-investment-products-amendment-eu-exit-regulations-2019/packaged-retail-and-insurance-based-investment-products-amendment-eu-exit-regulations-2019-explanatory-information| title=Packaged Retail and Insurance-based Investment Products (Amendment) (EU Exit)| publisher=GOV.UK| accessdate=February 1, 2020}} Regulations 2019: explanatory information&lt;/ref&gt;

If you are a US citizen or green card holder living in the UK, the way these restrictions combine severely limits your options for holding US domiciled ETFs with HMRC reporting fund status. You can use US brokerage accounts to access US domiciled ETFs, but getting access to a suitable account may be difficult; for example, you may have to open it using a US address and a US Social Security Number.

==Effects of ETFs gaining or losing HMRC reporting status==
You need to pay close attention to the "''HMRC reporting since''" column in the table above. HMRC has different tax rules where you hold an ETF or other "offshore" fund outside of any period in which it is an HMRC reporting fund.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/investment-funds/ifm13360| title=IFM13360 - Offshore Funds: income and distributions from non-reporting funds| publisher=HMRC| accessdate=March 1, 2023}} Conversion of a non-reporting fund to a reporting fund - Regulation 48.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/investment-funds/ifm13340| title=IFM13340 - Offshore Funds: reporting funds that become non-reporting funds| publisher=HMRC| accessdate=March 1, 2023}} Deemed disposal election - Regulation 100.&lt;/ref&gt;

==PFICs in UK pensions==
Under regulations issued by the IRS in 2016, there is an exemption to PFIC reporting for any funds you hold in [[UK personal pensions|UK pensions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://assets.kpmg.com/content/dam/kpmg/xx/pdf/2017/01/fa17-008.pdf| title=United States – IRS Issues Final PFIC Regulations| publisher=KPMG Global| accessdate=October 3, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here, the US/UK tax treaty protects you from PFIC rules, so that you can hold any funds you like in a UK pension, without being affected by these rules.

==Non-reporting funds in US pensions==
Symmetrically with the above, the UK's HMRC reporting funds regime only applies to funds you hold outside of UK tax-sheltered accounts. Holding non-reporting funds in a US pension, including Roth accounts, causes no tax problems. (Also, no problems in a UK pension or ISA, to the extent that PRIIPs does not prevent you from using them at all inside UK based accounts.)

The US is unique among developed nations in applying its full tax code both extraterritorially and permanently to '''US persons''' who do not live in the US.&lt;ref name="cbt"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/taxpayers-living-abroad| title=Taxpayers Living Abroad| publisher=IRS| accessdate=November 2, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; This creates significant investing problems, expenses, barriers, obstructions, and increased tax burdens for these individuals.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' lists and describes the major investing difficulties faced by '''US persons''' living outside the US. US persons are '''US citizens''' and '''US permanent residents''' (also known as green card holders). For permanent residents, even if their physical green card has expired and is no longer valid for immigration purposes, the US will continue to tax their worldwide income until they officially abandon permanent resident status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.angloinfo.com/blogs/global/us-tax/tax-court-affirms-informal-relinquishment-of-green-card-not-enough/| title=Tax Court Confirms It — "Informal" Relinquishment of Green Card NOT Enough!| publisher=Angloinfo| accessdate=September 19, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This article describes the situation for ''current'' US citizens and green card holders. It is also a list of considerations and planning points for people who are ''not yet'' US citizens but are contemplating becoming one in the future, and who do not plan to live in the US for the rest of their lives, and for US citizens living abroad who do not plan to return to the US to live, and who are ''considering renouncing'' their US citizenship to simplify their financial lives.

==Introduction==

The US taxes citizens and green card holders who do not live in the US,&lt;ref name="cbt" /&gt; but these people are also within the tax jurisdiction of the country in which they live. Unless they live in a country with no income tax, this means they are subject to at least two overlapping tax regimes. And potentially more than two, where local and state taxes also apply.

The [[Taxation as a US person living abroad#Foreign Earned Income Exclusion (FEIE)|Foreign Earned Income Exclusion]]&lt;ref name="feie"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/foreign-earned-income-exclusion| title=Foreign Earned Income Exclusion| publisher=IRS| accessdate=November 2, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; (FEIE) and [[Taxation as a US person living abroad#Foreign Tax Credit (FTC)|Foreign Tax Credit]]&lt;ref name="ftc"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/foreign-tax-credit| title=Foreign Tax Credit| publisher=IRS| accessdate=November 2, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; (FTC) mitigate some of the most obvious cases where double-tax could occur, and there is a commonly held belief that together these eliminate US tax for US persons living abroad.

This belief is false. The FEIE and the FTC are both limited and inadequate, and they do not fully protect from double-tax or from US tax except in the simplest of circumstances. The FEIE is limited to only earned income, and while you can carry over unused foreign tax credits in years when they are not used, the requirement for them to be characterised&lt;ref name="tc856"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc856| title=Topic No. 856 Foreign Tax Credit| publisher=IRS| accessdate=November 2, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; may mean that you cannot use excess credits in one category to offset tax from income that is in a different category.

The US has signed tax treaties with a reasonable number of countries,&lt;ref name="treaties"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/businesses/international-businesses/united-states-income-tax-treaties-a-to-z| title=United States Income Tax Treaties - A to Z| publisher=IRS| accessdate=November 2, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it uses the treaty ''saving clause''&lt;ref name="savingclause"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/businesses/tax-treaties-can-affect-your-income-tax| title=Tax Treaties Can Affect Your Income Tax| publisher=IRS| accessdate=November 2, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; to ensure that US persons can only use treaties in very limited circumstances. A treaty often fails to protect a US person from US tax.

The sections below describe cases where you will, as a US person living abroad, face double-tax or added US tax on top of your local tax liabilities, and where there is no protection from the FEIE, FTC, or any tax treaties. You may be able to avoid some of these with foresight and planning, and you can perhaps sidestep others with difficulty or perhaps by giving up an element of financial gain, but some are unavoidable.

==Earnings and salary==
{{see also|Taxation as a US person living abroad#Foreign Earned Income Exclusion (FEIE)|Taxation as a US person living abroad#Foreign housing exclusion or deduction|label 1=Taxation as a US person living abroad § Foreign Earned Income Exclusion (FEIE)|label 2=Taxation as a US person living abroad § Foreign housing exclusion or deduction}}

Specifically for ''employment'' earnings, as a US person living abroad, you can shelter up to a limited amount each year from US tax using the FEIE.&lt;ref name="feie" /&gt; Beyond this level though, you have to rely on foreign tax credits&lt;ref name="ftc" /&gt; to mitigate US tax on foreign earnings.

Because of the ''stacking rule'', the FEIE is less valuable than other deductions and exclusions. This rule requires you to calculate tax so that income above the FEIE is taxed as if no exclusion applied. In other words, it pushes income above the FEIE into higher tax brackets. It is therefore just a credit for the US tax that would have been due on the foreign income.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_earned_income_exclusion| title=Foreign earned income exclusion| publisher=Wikipedia| accessdate=November 2, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, you must have a ''tax home'' in a country other than the US, and the US does not recognise certain locations as foreign (for example, Antarctica).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/fatca/int_practice_units/JTO9431_06_12.pdf| title=Calculating Foreign Earned Income Exclusion - Employee| publisher=IRS| accessdate=February 10, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt; You can only claim the FEIE on a ''timely filed'' tax return. If you are a green card holder, you are unable to use the FEIE if you are not a citizen of or a national of a country with which the US has an income tax treaty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/publications/p54| title=Publication 54 (2019), Tax Guide for U.S. Citizens and Resident Aliens Abroad| publisher=IRS| accessdate=January 11, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alongside the FEIE, you may be able to obtain some extra protection from US tax on a foreign salary using the [[Taxation as a US person living abroad#Foreign housing exclusion or deduction|Foreign Housing Exclusion]].&lt;ref name="fhe"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/foreign-housing-exclusion-or-deduction| title=Foreign Housing Exclusion or Deduction| publisher=IRS| accessdate=November 2, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Where you earn above the FEIE, a foreign tax credit only helps if there is any local tax for you to credit against US tax. If you work in a country with low or no income taxes, you may have insufficient foreign taxes available for credit. In this case, you will pay tax to the US, and your own overall tax bill will be higher than non-US citizens who are otherwise in the same position as you.

:'''Warning''': ''Earned'' income and salary is the ''only type of income'' that is protected by the FEIE or the foreign housing exclusion. For everything else, listed below, you can only use foreign tax credits, and then only where there is an ''actual'' foreign tax liability for which the US allows a credit.

==Pensions, investment income, dividends and interest==
{{see also|Taxation as a US person living abroad#Foreign Tax Credit (FTC)|label 1=Taxation as a US person living abroad § Foreign Tax Credit (FTC)}}

You are liable to US tax on pensions, annuities, interest, dividends, capital gains, rent, royalties, and any other type of ''unearned'' or ''passive'' income that you receive as a US person abroad, no matter where that unearned or passive income is sourced. You can use foreign tax credits to reduce this US tax, but this will be no benefit where your local tax liability on this income is zero.&lt;ref group=note&gt;You can also lose out to foreign tax credits in the other direction. For example, if you hold US municipal bonds that are US tax-free, your local country will probably still tax income from them. In this case, you cannot claim a foreign tax credit against local tax, because you have no US tax liability. Unlike the reverse case though, this is not a problem that is unique to US citizens, but would apply to any resident of your country holding these same investments.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some countries have no income taxes at all.&lt;ref group=note&gt;For example, Bermuda, the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Oman.&lt;/ref&gt; And of those that do, some do not tax investment income.&lt;ref group=note&gt;For example, Singapore.&lt;/ref&gt; Or if they do, they tax it more lightly than other types of income, perhaps relying on sales taxes rather than income taxes for their tax revenue.

In addition, you have to categorise&lt;ref name="tc856" /&gt; your foreign tax credits, so that you can only claim credits against US tax where you paid local tax on the same category of income. This means that you may pay local tax on one type of non-employment income, US tax on a different type of non-employment income, and with no means of obtaining a credit for either. Worse, although you can carry unused foreign tax credits forwards, if not used they expire after ten years.&lt;ref name="tc856" /&gt; Additionally, there are flaws in the US foreign tax credit rules that may discriminate against  some taxpayers; specifically, taxpayers with a reduced rate on some classes of non-US source income, and whose marginal US tax rate is below the highest US tax bracket.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/303091786_Defects_in_foreign_tax_credit_rules| title=Defects in foreign tax credit rules| publisher=International Journal of Accounting and Finance| date=January 2016| accessdate=March 14, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Where your US tax liability on passive income exceeds any local tax liability on the same category of income, you are left with a US tax bill to pay. You cannot claim a foreign tax credit for non-US sales taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/what-foreign-taxes-qualify-for-the-foreign-tax-credit| title=What Foreign Taxes Qualify for the Foreign Tax Credit?| publisher=IRS| accessdate=November 2, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Locally tax-free savings and investment accounts===

A common case where you can face tax liabilities that are higher than those payable by citizens of other countries is where your country of residence generally taxes investment income, but offers limited tax-free or tax-advantaged local savings accounts and investment wrapper accounts.

Examples include UK [[UK Individual Savings Accounts|Individual Savings Accounts]] (ISA), Canadian [[finiki:Tax-Free Savings Account|Tax-Free Savings Accounts]] (TFSA), Japanese [[Investing from Japan#Nippon Individual Savings Accounts (NISA)|NISA]] accounts, and French [[Wikipedia:fr:Assurance-vie en France|Assurance-vie]] and [[Wikipedia:fr:Plan d'Épargne en Actions|Plan d'Épargne en Actions]] accounts. For all of these, all capital gains, dividends and interest occurring inside the wrapper are locally tax free. However, the US does not recognise these wrappers as a tax shelter,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.goldinglawyers.com/uk-isa-individual-savings-account-u-s-persons-tax-reporting/| title=US Taxation of ISA - Individual Savings Account |publisher=Golding &amp; Golding| accessdate=November 2, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax-free_savings_account#Risks_for_U.S._citizens_and_U.S_residents |title=Tax-free savings account § Risks for U.S. citizens and U.S. residents| publisher=Wikipedia| accessdate=November 2, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.taxesforexpats.com/france/us-tax-preparation-in-france.html#faq-194| title=Simple Tax Guide for Americans in France| publisher=Taxes for Expats| accessdate=November 11, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; and so will tax all of the income occurring inside them annually, as if they were normal unwrapped savings or investment accounts.

The result is that you will again pay higher tax than any non-US citizen in comparable circumstances.

===Net investment income tax===
{{main article|ACA net investment income tax}}

The Net Investment Income Tax&lt;ref name="niit"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/individuals/net-investment-income-tax| title=Find out if Net Investment Income Tax applies to you| publisher=IRS| accessdate=November 2, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; (NIIT) is a tax surcharge of 3.8% on investment income, and you pay this if your total gross income exceeds certain levels. The IRS has explicitly disallowed applying foreign tax credits to reduce the NIIT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/hr-management-services/newsletters/global-watch/assets/pwc-net-investment-income-tax-may-result-double-taxation.pdf| title=United States: Net investment income tax may result in double taxation and more complexity| publisher=PricewaterhouseCoopers| accessdate=November 2, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2013-12-02/pdf/2013-28410.pdf |title=Federal Register| publisher=US Department of the Treasury| accessdate=November 2, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, if subject to the NIIT you are likely to face double-tax.

If this investment income is not local-source, it is ''possible'' that your residence country ''may'' allow a tax credit for US NIIT paid. Otherwise, the result is pure double-tax on this portion of your investment income.

===Alternative minimum tax===

If you are subject to the [[wikipedia:Alternative_Minimum_Tax|alternative minimum tax]] (AMT), there are additional restrictions on how much foreign tax credit the US will allow you.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/foreign-tax-credit-special-issues| title=Foreign Tax Credit Special Issues| publisher=IRS| accessdate=November 7, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; This again leads to double-tax.

You also need to prepare — or pay to have prepared for you — two versions of each foreign tax credit form, one for regular tax and the other for AMT.

==Capital gains==

Capital gains give rise to several of the most vexing US tax problems for US citizens living abroad. Many countries either do not tax capital gains at all, or if they do then it is either lightly or with a sizeable exemption.

In contrast, the US fully taxes capital gains, and also differentiates between short-term and long-term holdings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc409| title=Topic No. 409 Capital Gains and Losses| publisher=IRS| accessdate=November 2, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; so that short-term gains are treated as income and taxed more heavily. It also computes the capital gain for foreign assets based on the exchange rates in effect at the dates of purchase and of sale.&lt;ref name="currency"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/fatca/int_practice_units/fcu_c_18_02_01_05.pdf |title=Character of Exchange Gain or Loss on Currency Transactions| publisher=IRS| accessdate=February 10, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of mismatches between the way the US and many other countries tax capital gains, it is easy for you to find yourself with a US capital gains tax liability that you cannot reduce or offset with any local tax liability.

===Phantom currency gains===

The US requires you to compute capital gains on foreign assets in USD only, using the exchange rate in effect when the asset was bought to arrive at the basis, and the rate in effect when the asset was sold to give the sale proceeds. This can result in a taxable USD gain, even where there is no local currency gain. And worse, the US taxes foreign currency gains at income tax rates.&lt;ref name="currency" /&gt;

For example, suppose you buy a rental property for €200,000 when the exchange rate is €1 = $1, and sell it later for, again, €200,000, but when the exchange rate has become €1 = $1.25. In EUR, your local currency, you have no gain. However, because the EUR/USD exchange rate changed while you owned that asset, you have a USD gain of $50,000. And you now owe US income tax on that $50,000. Because you have no local gain and so no local tax liability, you cannot reduce this US tax liability using foreign tax credits.

It is quite possible to make a local currency ''loss'' that nevertheless generates a US ''taxable gain''. Suppose that you had sold the rental property above for €180,000 instead. This is a EUR loss to you locally of €20,000, but a taxable USD gain of $25,000.

In the examples above, you are in a worse tax position than a similarly situated non-US citizen.

===Sale of primary residence===

In most countries, any gains you make on selling your primary home are generally free of tax. However, the US limits tax-free gains on your primary residence to $250,000 ($500,000 if married filing jointly), and also requires you to have lived in the house for two of the past five years before allowing any capital gains tax exemption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc701| title=Topic No. 701 Sale of Your Home| publisher=IRS| accessdate=November 2, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Where you sell your local home and fall outside of these US tax exclusions, you face a US tax liability for the gain on your home's value that again you cannot offset or mitigate by using foreign tax credits.&lt;ref group=note&gt;For a high-profile case of US tax on a foreign home, and one that led to renunciation of US citizenship, see: {{cite web| url=https://observer.com/2017/02/british-foreign-secretary-boris-johnson-renounces-us-citizenship-over-tax-dispute/| title=Boris Johnson Renounces US Citizenship Over Tax Dispute| publisher=Observer| accessdate=November 2, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; This US tax liability erodes your ability to buy another property, relative to other non-US citizens.

===Paying down a foreign loan or mortgage===

If you have a non-US loan, repaying it may create a US taxable event. This is a particular issue where the loan is a mortgage. Even superficially entirely normal actions such as remortgaging, changing mortgage provider, and making capital repayments can all lead to a US tax liability.

The culprit is [[#Phantom currency gains|phantom currency gains]], already mentioned above. ''US Tax &amp; Financial Services'' provides an example:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.ustaxfs.com/foreign-mortgage-repayment-exchange-rate-gain/| title=Foreign Mortgage Repayment and Exchange Rate Gain| publisher=US Tax &amp; Financial Services| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230925235533/https://www.ustaxfs.com/foreign-mortgage-repayment-exchange-rate-gain/| archive-date=September 25, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{blockquote|A mortgage for £100,000 is taken out when the exchange rate is £1 to $1.50.  A capital payment of £100,000 or the remortgage occurs when the exchange rate is £1 to $1.20.  This would result in a $30,000 exchange rate gain.

The IRS view is that the individual took out a debt of $150,000 (£100,000 x $1.50) but only had to repay $120,000 (£100,000 x $1.20). The $30,000 of debt no longer owed is regarded as gain and is taxed as ordinary income.  If we reverse the situation, i.e. assume the individual took out a mortgage for £100,000 and the exchange rate is £1 to $1.20 on the date it was taken out, and at the time of redemption or capital repayment the exchange rate is £1 to $1.50, the result is a US dollar loss of $30,000.  Unfortunately, this loss is a “personal” loss and personal losses are not deductible.|US Tax &amp; Financial Services}}

This can leave you significantly worse off, relative to non-US citizens who take identical actions.

==Non-US pensions==

Pensions are another treacherous area for US citizens living abroad. Some countries' tax treaties with the US cover pensions, at least partly, so in these countries the results might be less bad than in others, but grey areas in the treaty mean that poor tax outcomes are still likely.

The default case, where a non-US pension is not covered by treaty, is for the US to treat it as an ordinary unwrapped investment account, or potentially as a non-US trust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://creativeplanning.com/international/insights/the-foreign-pension-plan-dilemma-for-american-expats/| title=The Foreign Pension Plan Dilemma for American Expats| publisher=Creative Planning| accessdate=June 11, 2023| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230201070445/https://creativeplanning.com/international/insights/the-foreign-pension-plan-dilemma-for-american-expats/| archive-date=February 1, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;In March 2020, the IRS released [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/rp-20-17.pdf Revenue Procedure 2020-17] that provides an exemption from foreign trust reporting for "certain" non-US retirement savings plans. Unfortunately, the definition of plans that are exempt from reporting adopts a predictably US-centric view and is narrowly drawn, so that many and perhaps most other countries' retirement saving plans will fall outside of it. For more, see: {{cite web| url=https://americanexpatfinance.com/tax/item/384-tax-experts-critical-of-irs-effort-to-exempt-some-foreign-trusts| title=Tax experts critical of, and/or baffled by, new IRS effort to exempt some foreign trusts from info reporting| publisher=American Expat Finance| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230928103131/https://www.americanexpatfinance.com/tax/item/384-tax-experts-critical-of-irs-effort-to-exempt-some-foreign-trusts| archive-date=September 28, 2023}} Also: {{cite web| url=https://www.chamberlainlaw.com/assets/htmldocuments/Foreign%20retirement%20plans%20Forms%203520%20Forms%203520-A%20and%20Rev.%20Proc.%202020-17.pdf| title=Foreign Retirement and Savings Plans, Waiver of Forms 3520 and Forms 3520-A, and Limits of Rev. Proc. 2020-17| author=Hale E. Sheppard| date=March–April 2020| accessdate=February 7, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can lead directly to double-tax, for example where you pay US tax annually on contributions to the plan and gains within it, and then have to pay local tax on withdrawals when taken. Also, because of lack of information from the pension scheme itself, you may find it impossible to comply fully with US tax reporting rules.

Even if you live in a country where there is a treaty covering pensions (and the US does not disallow the pension articles using its ''saving clause''&lt;ref name="savingclause" /&gt;), you may still face problems.

For example, the US/UK treaty&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/businesses/international-businesses/united-kingdom-uk-tax-treaty-documents| title=United Kingdom (UK) - Tax Treaty Documents| publisher=IRS| accessdate=November 3, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; covers some [[UK personal pensions|UK pensions]] reasonably well, particularly employer pensions, but it limits your contributions to only what you would have been able to contribute to a similar plan, a 401k or IRA say, if you were employed in the US. US annual retirement savings limits are generally lower than UK ones, so you cannot save as much for retirement as your non-US citizen peers and colleagues can.

The situation in Australia is particularly poor. Australian ''superannuation plans''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superannuation_in_Australia| title=Superannuation in Australia| publisher=Wikipedia| accessdate=November 3, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; are partly compulsory, but are not covered by the US/Australia tax treaty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/businesses/international-businesses/australia-tax-treaty-documents| title=Australia Tax Treaty Documents| publisher=IRS| accessdate=November 3, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; If you live in Australia, you may have to declare your superannuation plan as a ''foreign grantor trust'', with extreme and onerous US tax and reporting outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/businesses/international-businesses/foreign-trust-reporting-requirements| title=Foreign Trust Reporting Requirements| publisher=IRS| accessdate=November 3, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; One expert explains:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://fixthetaxtreaty.org/problem/superannuation/| title=Superannuation – Let's Fix the Australia/US Tax Treaty!| publisher=fixthetaxtreaty.org| accessdate=November 3, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{blockquote|The second theory, used by the majority of US tax professionals, is that Superannuation is a non-qualified retirement plan under the US tax code. This can generate a number of different results depending on the nature of the superannuation fund receiving the contributions and its connection to the employer.

For funds that meet the qualifications of an employee’s trust under 26 USC 402(b) the likely outcome is that contributions to the fund are taxable in the US as they go in, earnings inside the fund are tax-deferred, and withdrawals are taxable as they come out with a deduction for an allocation of any contributions previously taxed. However, there are special fund eligibility requirements for highly compensated individuals, which will cause many higher income individuals to be required to include not only contributions in their current US taxable income, but also the earnings inside their superannuation fund.

Furthermore, if personal contributions exceed employer contributions, then the entire balance is treated as a foreign grantor-trust – requiring all income to be taxed currently on the US return in addition to several extra information returns, each of which carry a minimum penalty of US$10,000 for failure to file. Self-managed super funds (SMSFs) are particularly dangerous for US taxpayers as they are almost always seen as a foreign grantor-trust.

Finally, since superannuation is not a qualified US retirement plan, any movement of super balances between funds is treated as a taxable distribution. This includes consolidation of fund balances or rollovers when changing employment, all of which are tax free transactions under Australian tax law.

Any US tax paid on superannuation contributions, earnings, or rollovers will not be offset by a tax credit for Australian tax paid because these are tax-free transactions in Australia. Similarly, any US tax due on distribution to a retiree over the age of 60 will not have an offsetting credit for Australian tax paid.|Let's Fix the Australia/US Tax Treaty!}}

Treaties may offer some protection, so in the best cases you will only be subject to additional rules and restrictions on local retirement savings plans. In the worst cases though, you will face double-tax on your retirement savings, once by the US and then later on by your home country.

==Prizes, lottery and gambling winnings==

In many countries, prizes and winnings are tax-free. The US however, treats all gambling winnings, prizes, lottery wins, and any other competition wins as taxable income.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc419| title=Topic No. 419 Gambling Income and Losses| publisher=IRS| accessdate=November 17, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would encompass everything, from winning €100&amp;nbsp;million in the [[wikipedia:EuroMillions|EuroMillions lottery]] through to winning a cake at the local village fair.

So if you live in the UK and win £1&amp;nbsp;million in UK [[wikipedia:Premium_Bond|premium bonds]], you might face paying close to $350,000 in US income tax on this prize, and with no foreign tax credit offset. In contrast, a non-US citizen would pay nothing.

==Receipt of gifts and bequests==

As a general rule, US persons do not need to report receipt of gifts and bequests to the IRS. However, there is an exception for receipts of gifts and bequests from non-US persons above $100,000 in a year. You need to report these on Form 3520, under threat of penalties of $10,000 for late filing or noncompliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/businesses/gifts-from-foreign-person| title=Gifts from Foreign Person| publisher=IRS| accessdate=November 3, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tax on gift and bequest receipts===

US persons do not pay tax on gifts or bequests they receive, but with one important exception. Gifts and bequests from a ''covered expatriate''&lt;ref name="exittax"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/expatriation-tax| title=Expatriation Tax| publisher=IRS| accessdate=November 3, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; (under the US [[#Expatriation tax|expatriation tax]] rules) are subject to a 40% transfer tax on receipt, payable by the recipient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.bakermckenzie.com/-/media/files/insight/publications/2015/10/irs-issues-proposed-regulations-addressing-taxa2__/files/read-publication/fileattachment/irs_issues_proposed_regulations_addressing_taxat__.pdf| title=IRS Issues Proposed Regulations Addressing Taxation of US Citizens or Residents Receiving Gifts or Bequests from Expatriates| date=October 2015| publisher=Baker McKenzie| accessdate=July 12, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US introduced [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/2801 section 2801] tax in 2008, but the IRS did not create a route to compliance with this law until 2025.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/01/14/2025-00284/guidance-under-section-2801-regarding-the-imposition-of-tax-on-certain-gifts-and-bequests-from| title=Guidance Under Section 2801 Regarding the Imposition of Tax on Certain Gifts and Bequests From Covered Expatriates &lt;nowiki&gt;[TD 10027]&lt;/nowiki&gt;| publisher=Federal Register| date=January 14, 2025| accessdate=November 2, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2015/09/10/2015-22574/guidance-under-section-2801-regarding-the-imposition-of-tax-on-certain-gifts-and-bequests-from| title=Guidance Under Section 2801 Regarding the Imposition of Tax on Certain Gifts and Bequests From Covered Expatriates &lt;nowiki&gt;[REG-112997-10]&lt;/nowiki&gt;| publisher=Federal Register| date=September 10, 2015| accessdate=December 29, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3447485| title=How IRS Guidance Makes it impossible to Comply with Section 2801 in 2 Hours or Less| author=Fabio Ambrosio |publisher=SSRN| accessdate=November 3, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is an impressively long delay, even by the standards of the IRS.

Under section 2801 tax, if you receive a gift or bequest from a ''covered expatriate'' you will be much worse off than a non-US person receiving the same gift or bequest.&lt;ref name="section2801"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/businesses/gifts-from-foreign-person| title=Gifts from Foreign Person| publisher=IRS| accessdate=November 4, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controlled foreign corporations==

If you are an officer, director, or substantial shareholder in a company registered in your home country, the US may treat that company as a ''controlled foreign corporation''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/certain-taxpayers-related-to-foreign-corporations-must-file-form-5471| title=Certain Taxpayers Related to Foreign Corporations Must File Form 5471| publisher=IRS| accessdate=November 17, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; (CFC). This generates extremely onerous US tax reporting requirements, with penalties of up to $60,000 for noncompliance or late filing.

The ''Subpart F'' tax rule is particularly unpleasant. Buzzacott explains:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.buzzacott.co.uk/insights/stepping-stones-us-citizens-setting-up-a-uk-business| title=US citizens setting up a UK business| publisher=Buzzacott| accessdate=November 3, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{blockquote|In general, should you own greater than 50% of the shares of the limited company, you may be subject to Subpart F rules. This could apply if the limited company received the following types of income: dividends, interest, rent and royalties, to name a few.  It could also apply to income from personal service contracts where the corporation does not designate who performs the services.  The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) would tax the US person on their proportional share of the Subpart F income earned by the CFC, regardless whether this has been distributed to them. |Buzzacott}}

As the owner of a company that the US views as a CFC, you can face a much higher tax burden than a non-US citizen with the same level of ownership.

===Partnerships with non-US persons===

The ''controlled foreign corporation'' (CFC) rules outlined above can also make it difficult for you as a US citizen to enter into partnerships with other non-US citizens. Your participation will embroil the non-US corporation in a lot of US tax reporting that most non-US persons and companies are keen to avoid.

Anecdotally, US citizens are now finding it hard to enter into partnerships outside the US, and may find that they are being passed over for senior roles in existing companies.

==Foreign life insurance excise tax==

If you have a non-US life insurance policy, as well as facing US tax on any policy gains, you may owe a US excise tax on the premiums you pay for the policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://us-tax.org/2019/04/04/do-you-have-foreign-life-sickness-or-casualty-insurance-a-foreign-annuity-contract-excise-tax-fbar-form-8938/| title=Do You Have Foreign Life, Sickness, or Casualty Insurance? A Foreign Annuity Contract? Excise Tax / FBAR / Form 8938…| publisher=us-tax.org| date=April 4, 2019| accessdate=May 25, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If your residence country has a US tax treaty,&lt;ref name="treaties" /&gt; you may be exempt from this tax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/businesses/international-businesses/exemption-from-section-4371-excise-tax| title=Exemption from Section 4371 Excise Tax| publisher=IRS| accessdate=May 25, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; Otherwise, you have to report and pay this tax quarterly. The rate is 1% of the premiums paid.

==Extensive and intrusive reporting requirements==
{{see also|Taxation as a US person living abroad#Filing requirements|label 1=Taxation as a US person living abroad § Filing requirements}}

As a US person living abroad, you will have to deal with many more, and complex, IRS forms. These are forms that people living in the US will rarely encounter, if ever. These forms are difficult and time-consuming to complete, and costly if you find that you are forced to use a paid preparer. They are also intrusive, since they require you to list not just your taxable and non-taxable income, but also the full details of all your non-US accounts — income, account number, highest balance during the calendar year, name of non-US financial institution, and so on.

Typical forms you will encounter, above and beyond the normal [https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-1040 Form 1040] and all of its associated schedules and extra forms, are:
* [https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-2555 Form 2555], for claiming the Foreign Earned Income Exclusion.
* [https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-1116 Form 1116], to claim a Foreign Tax Credit. You might need to complete several of these.
* [https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-8938 Form 8938], Statement of Foreign Assets. Here you list the details, income and balances of all your non-US accounts. Essentially duplicative&lt;ref name="duplicative"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/businesses/comparison-of-form-8938-and-fbar-requirements| title=Comparison of Form 8938 and FBAR Requirements| publisher=IRS| accessdate=November 4, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; with FinCEN form 114, but often you have to file both.
* [https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-8833 Form 8833], Treaty-Based Return Position Disclosure. Used to claim tax treaty benefits.
* [https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-5471 Form 5471], Information Return of US Persons With Respect to Certain Foreign Corporations. Used for controlled foreign corporations (CFC).
* [https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-8865 Form 8865], Return of US Persons with Respect to Certain Foreign Partnerships. As above, just more of the same.
* [https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-8621 Form 8621], Information Return by a Shareholder of a Passive Foreign Investment Company (PFIC). Extremely time-consuming, but required if you hold any non-US domiciled funds or ETFs. The IRS's estimated time to complete this form is over 48 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/instructions/i8621| title=Instructions for Form 8621| publisher=IRS| accessdate=November 3, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-3520 Form 3520], Annual Return to Report Transactions With Foreign Trusts and Receipt of Certain Foreign Gifts. For any activity involving non-US trusts, and also for gifts and bequests from non-US sources above $100,000.
* [https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-3520-A Form 3520-A], Annual Information Return of Foreign Trust with a US Owner. Required if you own a local trust. Another extremely time-consuming and complex form.
* [https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/report-of-foreign-bank-and-financial-accounts-fbar FinCEN Form 114], Foreign Bank Account Reporting (FBAR). Filed annually with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Center. You can only file this form electronically. The threshold for filing is very low, just $10,000 in non-US accounts. Essentially duplicative&lt;ref name="duplicative" /&gt; with form 8938, but often you have to file both.
* [https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-720 Form 720], Quarterly Federal Excise Tax Return. For US excise tax on any non-US life insurance premiums paid.

===Disadvantageous tax filing status options===
{{see also|Taxation as a US person living abroad#Non-citizen spouses|label 1=Taxation as a US person living abroad § Non-citizen spouses}}

If you are married, you have the choice of filing US tax as ''Married Filing Jointly'' (MFJ) or ''Married Filing Separately'' (MFS). If your spouse is not a US person though, choosing MFJ will subject them to the full extent of difficult and unpleasant US tax laws on all of their own non-US income and financial affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/nonresident-alien-spouse| title=Nonresident Alien Spouse| publisher=IRS| accessdate=November 3, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most non-US spouses (sensibly) wish to keep the IRS entirely out of their personal financial affairs. This means that unless you can use ''Head of Household'' status, you can only use MFS when you file your US taxes. This is generally less advantageous than filing jointly with a spouse, and often also less advantageous than filing ''Single''. In other words, the rules push you into the US tax filing category that has the highest tax rates and the lowest allowances of all the available options.

This usually has the effect of leaving you in a worse tax position than a similarly situated US citizen living in the US.

===Expensive tax filings===

Unless your finances are extremely simple, using a paid preparer to complete your US tax return will be extremely costly. Typical fees to complete forms such as 3520 and 5471 alone run to between $200 to $600 for each copy needed, in addition to the base cost of completing the 1040 and its associated schedules.

US expats with finances that are entirely regular and vanilla in local terms regularly complain of US tax preparation fees of around $2,000 to $3,000 or more annually. This is an out-of-pocket expense that your non-US citizen peers do not have to pay.

===Extreme penalties for noncompliance===

The penalties for noncompliance of US reporting rules are draconian, often two orders of magnitude or more above the penalty a US resident would face for similar noncompliance or late form filing.

For example, the penalty for a late-filed form 3520 begins at $10,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/instructions/i3520| title=Instructions for Form 3520 (2018)| publisher=IRS| accessdate=November 3, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the IRS has begun aggressively enforcing this penalty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irsmedic.com/blog/2019/02/irs-form-3520-a.html| title=The IRS is improperly and automatically assessing $10,000 Form 3520-A penalties - what to do now| publisher=IRS Medic| accessdate=June 11, 2023| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220814001100/https://www.irsmedic.com/blog/2019/02/irs-form-3520-a.html| archive-date=August 14, 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.americanexpatfinance.com/news/item/287-victims-of-irs-forms-3520-and-3520-a-coming-forward| title='Victims' Of IRS forms 3520 and 3520-A coming forward to protest large and 'unfair' penalties| publisher=The American Expat Financial News Journal| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230929043447/https://www.americanexpatfinance.com/news/item/287-victims-of-irs-forms-3520-and-3520-a-coming-forward| archive-date=September 29, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; The penalty for non-filing of form 8938 starts at $10,000 and rises to $60,000.&lt;ref name="i8938"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/instructions/i8938| title=Instructions for Form 8938 (2018)| publisher=IRS| accessdate=November 3, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; And the penalty for non-filing of form 8865 follows the same pattern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/instructions/i8865| title=Instructions for Form 8865| publisher=IRS| accessdate=November 3, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most extreme penalty of all — and one that may arguably be in violation of the US constitution's eighth amendment ''excessive fines'' clause — is the civil penalty for not filing FinCEN form 114 (also known as FBAR). This is $12,921 if non-wilful, and the higher of $129,210 or 50% of the highest account balance for the year, if wilful.&lt;ref name="fbar"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/report-of-foreign-bank-and-financial-accounts-fbar| title=Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts FBAR| publisher=IRS| accessdate=November 3, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;In 2015, congress mandated the IRS to revise the FBAR penalty amounts upwards from $10,000 and $100,000, citing "inflation" as the reason for the increases. Notably however, the threshold non-US account balance for filing this form has remained at $10,000 since the FBAR was first introduced in 1970. Unlike the penalties for non-filing, the threshold has ''never'' been increased for inflation. For more, see: {{cite web| url=https://sherayzenlaw.com/us-taxpayers-nightmare-continues-fbar-penalty-inflation-adjustment/| title=US Taxpayers’ Nightmare Continues: FBAR Penalty Inflation Adjustment| publisher=Sherayzen Law| accessdate=June 11, 2023| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230402093520/https://sherayzenlaw.com/us-taxpayers-nightmare-continues-fbar-penalty-inflation-adjustment/| archive-date=April 2, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; Penalties may apply per year, in the case of multiple year violations, so that in the worst cases the penalties for non-filing may exceed the account balance.

As a US person residing abroad, you have to learn to live with the perpetual risk of these oppressive penalties for simple form errors. Many US expats find that this alone creates considerable emotional and mental stress, quite apart from the bureaucratic nuisance and tax expense of the US's citizenship-based taxation regime.

===Extended or no statute of limitations===

Normally, the IRS has three years from a tax return due date in which to assess tax. This rises to six years for "substantial understatement" of income.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/how-long-should-i-keep-records| title=How long should I keep records? | publisher=IRS| accessdate=December 28, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, for certain forms relating to non-US assets, such as form 8938, the statute of limitations ''does not begin to run at all'' if you are required to file this form but do not. If you omit form 5471 from your return, your entire tax return remains ''open for audit indefinitely'', leaving no cover whatsoever from a statute of limitations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.americanbar.org/groups/business_law/publications/blt/2017/08/06_wood/| title=IRS Can Audit for Three Years, Six, or Forever: Here’s How to Tell| publisher=American Bar Association| accessdate=December 28, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revocation or denial of US passport===

If you find yourself in the position of having what the IRS terms a "seriously delinquent tax debt", the IRS can inform the State Department, which may then revoke your US passport, or refuse to issue a new one if your current one has expired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/revocation-or-denial-of-passport-in-case-of-certain-unpaid-taxes| title=Revocation or Denial of Passport in Case of Certain Unpaid Taxes | publisher=IRS| accessdate=July 7, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For this to occur, you have to reach a given level of US tax debt. However, this debt is inclusive of any interest or penalties, meaning that the large penalties for non-filing forms such as 3520 make this level more easily reachable than you might imagine. Notably however, FBAR non-filing penalties are ''not'' included in the definition of debt for this purpose.

For some people, typically those with another citizenship besides the US, being denied a US passport may pose few if any problems. For others though, perhaps where residency in their current country is based on their US passport, it could create serious problems.

==FATCA, PFIC and PRIIPs==
{{see also|Passive foreign investment company}}

One of the effects of the [[wikipedia:Foreign_Account_Tax_Compliance_Act|Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act]] (FATCA) is that non-US banks and financial institutions are now forced to search their customer bases for 'US indicia' such as a US phone number, US address, or US place of birth, and then report any customers that they suspect of being US persons either to the IRS directly, or indirectly through their own country's tax authority where that country has signed a FATCA ''Intergovernmental Agreement'' (IGA) with the US.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Under the FATCA IGAs, some common local country account types may be excluded from FATCA reporting by the non-US bank or financial institution to the IRS, for example UK ISAs. However, these accounts are ''not'' exempt from reporting by individuals, and so you would still need to include them on any form 8938 and FinCEN form 114 that you file annually with the IRS.&lt;/ref&gt; The threat from the US for noncompliance is a withholding tax of 30% on all payments from the US to that non-US bank or financial institution.

Because this is both a major costly administrative burden and a significant compliance penalty risk, a number of non-US banks and financial institutions have taken the commercial decision to no longer offer services to US persons. This includes those living in the same country as the bank, and who may also be full citizens of that country as well as being US citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/35383435| title=Why expat Americans are giving up their passports| publisher=BBC News| accessdate=November 4, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; As further fallout, some US financial institutions now also refuse service to US persons who are not living in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://brighttax.com/blog/breaking-fatca-news-now-us-banks-are-closing-expats-accounts-too/| title=Breaking FATCA News - Now US Banks are Closing Expats’ Accounts Too| publisher=Bright!Tax Expat Tax Services| accessdate=June 11, 2023| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230322003816/https://brighttax.com/blog/breaking-fatca-news-now-us-banks-are-closing-expats-accounts-too/| archive-date=March 22, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A US tax law, [[Passive foreign investment company]] (PFIC), applies unpalatable tax rules to US persons who own non-US domiciled funds or ETFs.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Practically every non-US domiciled fund and ETF will be a US PFIC. As a quick way to tell, if it has 'UCITS' somewhere in its name, it is European domiciled and so a PFIC. Aside from reading its prospectus, KID, or fund documents, the other unambiguous way to tell is to find its ISIN. If the first two letters are not 'US', it is almost certainly a US PFIC for tax purposes. Most UCITS funds are domiciled in either Ireland, with ISIN code 'IE', or Luxembourg, with ISIN code 'LU'.&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, if you hold US domiciled funds or ETFs, you might run into difficult or punitive local tax rules for holding 'offshore' funds, leaving you in a no-win situation.

And in 2018, an EU regulation known as [https://finance.ec.europa.eu/consumer-finance-and-payments/retail-financial-services/key-information-documents-packaged-retail-and-insurance-based-investment-products-priips_en PRIIPs] became operational. It requires funds and ETFs sold to EU residents to provide a ''Key Investor Information Document'' (KID, or KIID) in a particular format. As of 2025, no US domiciled fund or ETF produces a KID. The UK left the EU in January 2020, but created its own 'UK PRIIPs' regime that is fully aligned with the EU PRIIPs, so PRIIPs restrictions continue to apply in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/draft-packaged-retail-and-insurance-based-investment-products-amendment-eu-exit-regulations-2019/packaged-retail-and-insurance-based-investment-products-amendment-eu-exit-regulations-2019-explanatory-information| title=Packaged Retail and Insurance-based Investment Products (Amendment) (EU Exit)| publisher=GOV.UK| accessdate=February 1, 2020}} Regulations 2019: explanatory information&lt;/ref&gt;

This means that your situation is especially problematic if you live in the EU or the UK. Here, these three tax rules combine in a way that can make it practically impossible for you to own any index funds or ETFs. The only simple viable route is through a US based account with US based broker. Opening one may involve convincing them that you are a US resident, even though not. Otherwise, you run into problems opening a local brokerage account due to FATCA. And if you can find and open one, you will not be able to buy US domiciled funds or ETFs because of PRIIPs,&lt;ref group=note&gt;Forum member "finrod_2002" provides details of how an investor might use options trades to work around PRIIPs restrictions, in {{forum post|p=4386305|title=Re: European, dutch investor here: Is investing in VTI and VXUS still a good choice?|date=17 Feb 2019}}, viewed 28 Oct 2019.&lt;/ref&gt; and will run into the US PFIC tax rules if you use non-US domiciled ones.

Your non-US citizen peers, friends, and family can invest freely through local brokerages, using non-US domiciled index funds and ETFs, without any of these tax drawbacks and limitations.

==State tax==
{{see also|State income taxes}}

US states that have income taxes vary in the way they treat individuals who move outside the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.taxesforexpats.com/articles/expat-tax-rules/state-taxes-and-american-expats.html| title=State Tax &amp; US Expat Tax Responsibilities| publisher=Taxes for Expats| accessdate=November 6, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible, then, that you have a state income tax filing requirement, and perhaps actual tax liability, as well as US federal tax requirements. Details are too diffuse and complicated to go into here, and you will need to investigate your situation with whichever state or states might claim you as a taxpayer.

Not all US states recognise US tax treaties, and so if you are relying on a treaty to protect you from US tax, this treaty may not protect you from any US state tax liability you may have.

As always, non-US citizens in the same situation as you will have none of these difficulties with US state taxes.

==Discrimination==

As well as the direct difficulties caused by your US citizenship, there are also some indirect ones. Two have already been mentioned. They are: inability to open accounts at many non-US banks and brokerages, and also at some US brokerages, due to [[#FATCA, PRIIPs and PFIC|FATCA]]; and possible inability to enter into [[#Partnerships with non-US persons|foreign partnerships]].

A less obvious restriction on your employment prospects comes from the requirement to file FinCEN form 114 (also known as FBAR). This form requires you to report&lt;ref name="fbar" /&gt; ...
{{blockquote|... a financial interest in ''or signature or other authority over'' at least one financial account located outside the United States.|IRS, Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts}}
This includes any employer accounts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.fincen.gov/reporting-corporate-accounts| title=Reporting Corporate Accounts| publisher=FinCEN| accessdate=November 7, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.angloinfo.com/blogs/global/us-tax/3322-2/| title=Signature Authority Over Employer’s Accounts? Numerous Accounts? Read the FBAR Instructions, They’re Good for You!| publisher=Angloinfo| accessdate=November 6, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; for which you are responsible, and non-US companies generally will not allow their account details to be passed to the IRS.

As a result of this, you can be rejected for, or otherwise unable to take on, certain roles within non-US corporations, particularly any in finance or accounting. These roles will instead be filled by your non-US citizen colleagues.

You may be excluded from non-US trusts. Foreign trusts with a US person owner or a US person beneficiary acquire certain added reporting requirements,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.buzzacott.co.uk/insights/what-us-tax-issues-are-there-for-us-taxpayers-with-foreign-trusts| title=What US tax issues are there for US taxpayers with foreign trusts?| publisher=Buzzacott| accessdate=November 6, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; either to the IRS or to you, that most will be keen to avoid. The easiest way for them to avoid these reporting requirements is to exclude you from the trust.

When considering employees for foreign assignments, companies look closely at the costs of the assignment. The US's citizenship based taxation makes US citizens more expensive for these assignments, either because the company must increase its salary offer or because it will need to provide 'tax equalisation'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.forum-expat-management.com/users/33203-hugo-lesser/posts/20796-us-tax-equalization-for-us-expat-employees| title=US Tax Equalization for US Expat Employees| publisher=The Forum for Expatriate Management| accessdate=November 6, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; as part of its relocation package.

This makes you more expensive to employ than non-US citizens, and so less competitive in the global jobs marketplace. It is a particular problem where you will relocate to a country with low or no income taxes.

Additionally, any 'tax equalisation' package will only cover salary. It will not cover you for any of the other US tax problems you will face, such as double-tax on investment income or tax on phantom currency gains. An employer might cover the cost of your (expensive) US tax filings, but this will itself be a taxable benefit.

==Expatriation tax==
{{see also|Taxation as a US person living abroad#Expatriation tax for losing citizenship or permanent residency|label 1=Taxation as a US person living abroad § Expatriation tax for losing citizenship or permanent residency}}

The US has an [[wikipedia:Expatriation_tax#United_States|expatriation tax]] that applies to US citizens who [[wikipedia:Relinquishment_of_United_States_nationality|renounce]] their US citizenship. It passed into law in 2008, as part of the mostly unrelated HEART act,&lt;ref name="HEART"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/110th-congress/house-bill/6081| title=H.R.6081 - 110th Congress (2007-2008): Heroes Earnings Assistance and Relief Tax Act of 2008| publisher=Congress.gov, Library of Congress| accessdate=November 4, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is administered by the following form:

* [https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-8854 Form 8854], Initial and Annual Expatriation Statement. Used to certify compliance with tax obligations. Requires a list and valuation of all worldwide assets.

You trigger this tax if you have total assets above $2&amp;nbsp;million, not indexed for inflation, or if you exceed a given annual federal tax liability over the preceding five years.&lt;ref name="exittax" /&gt; It also applies to long-term green card holders who formally abandon their US permanent resident status, if they have held a green card in eight years or more.&lt;ref group=note&gt;As little as six years and two days of US permanent resident status may be enough to trigger the US expatriation tax; that is, December 31 in year one to January 1 in year eight inclusive.&lt;/ref&gt; There is an exemption for individuals who are dual citizens from birth, and who have no recent history of being US resident.&lt;ref group=note&gt;This exemption for certain citizens arguably violates most US tax treaty 'non-discrimination' clauses.&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals subject to the expatriation tax are known as ''covered expatriates''.

There are three main provisions to the US expatriation tax, also commonly known as the 'exit tax'. The first can often be mitigated, but the other two are repressive, and at least in one case, usually unavoidable. Because it overrides the provisions of tax treaties the US has signed with other countries, the US expatriation tax potentially violates the [[wikipedia:Vienna_Convention_on_the_Law_of_Treaties|Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Infanti, Anthony C.| url=https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=263133| title=Curtailing Tax Treaty Overrides: A Call to Action| publisher=University of Pittsburgh Law Review, Vol. 62| page=677| date=2001| accessdate=March 18, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If you are planning to renounce your US citizenship or give up long term US resident status, the usual advice such as saving the maximum into local pensions or US IRAs and 401ks, or using [[Health savings account|health savings accounts]] (HSA), may not apply. In this case you might instead prefer investments that are easily liquidated, sit outside the expatriation tax [[#Immediate tax on retirement accounts balances|deemed disposition rules for retirement accounts]], do not come with US or other political risk, and will not be problematic in your home country.

===Deemed distribution===

The US "deems" your assets to have been sold on the date of expatriation. This is a ''pretend'' sale of your assets, but if these assets have unrealised built-in capital gains then you have to pay the tax on them immediately with ''real'' money. There is a sizeable exemption&lt;ref name="exittax" /&gt; before any tax becomes due. You cannot use the $250,000 ($500,000 if married and filing jointly) primary residence capital gains tax exclusion in a year in which you are "subject to expatriate tax".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/publications/p523| title=Publication 523 (2020), Selling Your Home| publisher=IRS| accessdate=September 10, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several ways in which you can reduce or counter this tax. Simplest is to give away assets to bring you below the $2&amp;nbsp;million asset test for the tax. This may involve you filing US gift tax returns and using up some of your lifetime US gift and bequest allowance, but consuming that is not an issue as you will no longer be a US citizen after renouncing, and so free and clear of future US estate taxes, at least provided you organise your assets correctly once you become a US nonresident alien. Because the US estate tax can look back up to three years on gifts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.floridabar.org/the-florida-bar-journal/expatriation-from-the-united-states-the-exit-tax/| title=Expatriation from the United States: The Exit Tax| publisher=Florida Bar Journal| date=November–December 2020| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211120122929/https://www.floridabar.org/the-florida-bar-journal/expatriation-from-the-united-states-the-exit-tax/| archive-date=November 20, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;The referenced article in the Florida Bar Journal conveys the impression that gifts are disallowed on expatriation within three years. Later clarification suggests however that this is wrong; instead, for some cases it would only apply on death within three years of the gift. See: {{forum post|t=362120|title=Expatriation Tax Planning Strategies - Gifts to Spouse &amp; 3-Year Rule|author=AtticusFin|date=November 10, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; you may need to start planning expatriation several years in advance.

You might also consider selling and repurchasing liquid assets, to eliminate unrealised capital gains. This will be harder with illiquid assets though, for example your home or other real estate. This can be particularly important where assets will be liable to your home country's capital gains tax later. In this case, the result will be double-tax, because countries do not give tax credits for taxes paid years or decades earlier on "deemed" — that is, ''pretend'' — asset sales.

===Immediate tax on retirement accounts balances===

This is an extremely unpleasant expatriation tax provision. The tax "deems" your retirement savings accounts and other deferred compensation to have been distributed fully on the date of expatriation, so that they become taxable as income all in a single year. The exemption mentioned above for the "deemed" distribution of other assets&lt;ref name="exittax" /&gt; does not apply to this provision. Immediate tax on your entire retirement savings balance will drive up your tax to extreme levels, and could easily destroy your retirement prospects entirely.

The exception to this is a 401k. To avoid a "deemed" distribution, you must voluntarily waive your tax treaty rights on reduced withholding on this income,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-w-8-ce| title=About Form W-8 CE, Notice of Expatriation and Waiver of Treaty Benefits| publisher=IRS| accessdate=November 8, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; and so pay a flat 30% US withholding tax on all withdrawals. (You may be able to reclaim this under the appropriate treaties.)

Where your home country taxes withdrawals from a 401k or IRA, these can lead to double-tax on retirement savings. For IRAs in particular, countries are unlikely to allow you credit for any "deemed" US tax paid perhaps years or decades earlier.

One possible way to defuse some of the problem here could be to use a Roth 401k or a Roth IRA. The contribution and conversion elements of these will not be taxable, leaving only the earnings and gains to generate a tax liability. However, other countries rarely recognise the tax-free nature of a US Roth account,&lt;ref group=note&gt;The UK is one known case where the US/UK tax treaty preserves the nature of Roth accounts for UK residents. For other countries, you will need to study local tax laws and any applicable US tax treaty very carefully.&lt;/ref&gt; so you will need to be sure of your local tax position on these.

===Tax on future gifts and bequests to US persons===

The worst expatriation tax provision of all. Section 2801 taxes gifts and bequests to a US person from a covered expatriate at a rate of 40%.&lt;ref name="section2801" /&gt; For more, see [[#Tax on gift and bequest receipts|Tax on gift and bequest receipts]], above.

This captures money made perhaps long after renouncing US citizenship. It also leads to double-tax, and perhaps even to triple-tax. For example, money that has already been taxed by the US under the expatriation tax or normal income or capital gains tax rules is then taxed a second time when received by a US person from a covered expatriate. If that money also faces local country tax so that it is double-taxed due to another US tax provision, the result is triple-tax.

This expatriation tax provision encourages covered expatriates to exclude US persons for gifts and bequests. It also motivates entire families to expatriate together.

===Reed amendment===

The [[wikipedia:Reed_Amendment_(immigration)|Reed Amendment]] attempts to create a permanent entry ban on covered expatriates ever returning to the US, even for a short visit.

Since its passage in 1996, the Reed amendment has so far proved mostly unenforceable. There have been multiple attempts over the years to shore it up so that it can be enforced, but so far none has achieved much success.

However, this does not mean that it will not be enforced in future, and potentially retroactively. As a US person living abroad, if you are considering renouncing your US citizenship to free yourself from the difficulties caused by US taxes, you will need to bear this in mind.

==Retroactive US tax laws==

The US expatriation tax,&lt;ref name="exittax" /&gt; passed in 2008, is arguably a retroactive tax provision. It adversely alters the taxation of retirement savings made years or decades earlier, based on characteristics (such as holding a green card) that might not have been entered into had the law existed at the time. It may capture gains that accrued long ''before'' a ''covered expatriate'' became a US person. And also, under section 2801,&lt;ref name="section2801" /&gt; gains that accrue long ''after'' ceasing to be a US person. It results in double-tax that would not have occurred before.

A more recent example is the ''Global intangible low-taxed income'' tax&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/what-global-intangible-low-taxed-income-and-how-it-taxed-under-tcja| title=What is global intangible low-taxed income and how is it taxed under the TCJA?| publisher=Tax Policy Center| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230929143137/https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/what-global-intangible-low-taxed-income-and-how-it-taxed-under-tcja| archive-date=September 29, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; (GILTI), passed in the ''Tax Cuts and Jobs Act'' (TCJA) in 2017. This tax was marketed as being aimed at global multinational corporates, but as written it also applies to individual CFCs being managed by US person entrepreneurs abroad. Its "deemed" repatriation tax provision looks back 31 years, and taxes earnings and profits retained in CFCs and accumulated from 1986 to 2017, even if there is no actual flow of funds back to the shareholder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.americansabroad.org/media/files/files/0513d4c0/bugnion-04-29-2019-.pdf| title=A Double Taxation Nightmare Disguised as Tax Reform| publisher=Viewpoint Tax Notes| author=Bugnion, Jackie| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220815224356/https://www.americansabroad.org/media/files/files/0513d4c0/bugnion-04-29-2019-.pdf| archive-date=August 15, 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because these profits will be taxable locally when actually distributed or taken, the likely result is double-tax.

The US both enacts retroactive tax laws and uses "deeming" as a fictive way of creating a tax liability in the absence of any actual taxable event or income. As a US citizen abroad, you will need to be on constant lookout for these types of laws, and be ready to reorganise your assets, or perhaps your entire life, to avoid being financially damaged by them.

==Unknown future US tax laws==

Nobody knows what new taxes the US will create that cause further problems for US persons living abroad. If the past is a guide though, the direction of travel does not appear promising. And there are two areas where attempts to worsen tax laws further for US persons abroad are already visible.

===Ex-PATRIOT act===

As a reaction to [[wikipedia:Eduardo_Saverin|Eduardo Saverin]] renouncing US citizenship, in 2012 the US congress attempted to pass the [[wikipedia:Ex-PATRIOT_Act|Ex-PATRIOT Act]]. The main effect of this act would have been to impose a permanent US entry ban on ''specified expatriates'' (essentially, the same people who are ''covered expatriates'' under the US expatriation tax). In other words, banishment for renouncing citizenship if you have a certain level of assets or wealth.

Crucially, the Ex-PATRIOT act includes the following text:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/112th-congress/senate-bill/3205/text| title=Text - S.3205 - 112th Congress (2011-2012): Ex-PATRIOT Act| publisher=Congress.gov, Library of Congress| accessdate=November 17, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{blockquote|For purposes of subparagraph (A), the term ‘specified expatriate’ means, with respect to any taxable year, any covered expatriate (as defined in section 877A(g)(1)) whose expatriation date (as defined in section 877A(g)(3)) occurs after the date which is 10 years prior to the date of the enactment of this subparagraph.|Ex-PATRIOT Act}}
This is overtly retroactive. Ex-PATRIOT did not pass in 2012, but there have been attempts since to try to pass it again. So far none has succeeded, but this is not to say that it will never pass.

===Repeal of the FEIE===

The Foreign Earned Income Exclusion is a regular target for repeal or abolition in congressional bills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.crfb.org/blogs/tax-break-down-foreign-earned-income-exclusion| title=The Tax Break-Down: Foreign Earned Income Exclusion| publisher=Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget| accessdate=November 17, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the moment, it is still in place, but it may be a matter of time before you are left with only imperfect foreign tax credits to protect you from US tax on your non-US earnings and salary.

==Effects on other family members==

Your US citizenship can have tax effects on other members of your family. Some are avoidable, but others are not.

===Entangling a non-US spouse in US tax laws===

If you hold any joint accounts with your spouse, these need to be reported on both Form 8938 and FinCEN form 114.&lt;ref name="i8938" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fbar" /&gt; Understandably, most non-US persons are unhappy with having details of their personal finances sent annually to the IRS and to FinCEN.

This occurs independently of which US tax filing status you use. It may be unwise for you as a US citizen to maintain any joint accounts with a non-US spouse.

===Entangling children in US tax laws===

If you meet the necessary US residency and marital status requirements, any children you have that are born abroad will nevertheless automatically become US citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal/travel-legal-considerations/us-citizenship/Acquisition-US-Citizenship-Child-Born-Abroad.html| title=Acquisition of U.S. Citizenship by a Child Born Abroad| publisher=U.S. Department of State| accessdate=November 17, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that they immediately acquire all of the tax problems described in this article.&lt;ref group=note&gt;For a high-profile example of this, see: {{cite web| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-47889162| title=Royal baby: Could Harry and Meghan’s son pay US taxes?| publisher=BBC| accessdate=November 4, 2019}} Also: {{cite web| url=https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/09/royal-baby-archie-faces-a-complicated-tax-situation.html| title=Royal baby Archie faces a complicated tax situation| publisher=CNBC| accessdate=November 4, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

You cannot renounce your children's US citizenship on their behalf. Only they can do this,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal/travel-legal-considerations/us-citizenship/Relinquishing-US-Nationality-Abroad.html| title=Relinquishing U.S. Nationality Abroad| publisher=U.S. Department of State| accessdate=April 16, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt; and generally not earlier than age 18. Because of the inflexible and inhumane way this law operates, it is impossible for individuals with "developmental or intellectual disabilities" to ever renounce US citizenship, leaving them trapped for life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/u-s-fatca-tax-law-catches-unsuspecting-canadians-in-its-crosshairs-1.2493864| title=U.S. FATCA tax law catches unsuspecting Canadians in its crosshairs| publisher=CBC News| accessdate=November 6, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-US persons are '''US nonresident aliens'''. That is, they are not '''US citizens''' and not '''US permanent residents''' (also known as green card holders).

The US has complicated&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| publisher=Wikipedia| url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_tax_in_the_United_States#The_complexity_of_the_U.S._income_tax_laws| title=Income tax in the United States § The complexity of the U.S. income tax laws| accessdate=March 17, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; tax laws that often apply unfavourably to non-US investment holdings and assets. These can create significant tax difficulties and expenses for new US residents who have investments or other assets in their non-US country and which they do not cash in before becoming US residents.

The information in this article describes the situation for ''new'' US residents, people who have ''moved to the US'' from other countries. It is also a list of considerations for anybody who is ''not yet'' a US resident but is contemplating becoming one in the future.

==Introduction==
{{see also|Tax basics}}

In contrast to countries that allow an initial period of ''non-domicile'' residence before becoming a full taxable resident, the US taxes its residents on their worldwide income, and applies its full tax code from the moment that a person becomes a US tax resident. These rules can tax gains or income that accrued perhaps years or even decades ''before'' becoming a US tax resident. It has [[Passive foreign investment company|punitive tax laws]] for assets or investments held outside of the US by US residents.

This combination causes problems for new US residents who leave investments or assets behind in their previous country of residence when they move to the US. The sections below describe how new US residents can face unpleasant US tax surprises.

==US residency for tax purposes==

===Definition of US residency for tax purposes===

The US uses two separate tests to determine "residency for tax purposes".&lt;ref group=note&gt;Your US "residency for tax purposes" does not necessarily match your US residency for immigration purposes. For example, under the ''substantial presence test'' you can become a US taxable person but not be a US resident under US immigration law. Conversely, under the ''green card test'', if you have not yet entered the US you are technically a US permanent resident according to US immigration law, but not yet a US taxable person.&lt;/ref&gt; These are:
* the [[wikipedia:Green_Card_Test|green card test]], and
* the [[wikipedia:Substantial_Presence_Test|substantial presence test]].

Under the [[wikipedia:Green_Card_Test|green card test]], you are a US taxable person if you have spent at least one day in the US as a permanent resident. Under this test, it is ''not'' a requirement that you possess a physical [[wikipedia:Green_card|green card]], just that your application is approved and activated. Also, you are not a US taxable person if you have received the card, but have yet to enter the US.

Under the [[wikipedia:Substantial_Presence_Test|substantial presence test]], the US counts the number of days of presence in the country in a given year, including weighted periods of presence in prior years.&lt;ref group=note&gt;The actual calculation is: (days present in the tax year) + (1/3) &amp;times; (days present in the year before the tax year) + (1/6) &amp;times; (days present in the year two years before the tax year).&lt;/ref&gt; If this exceeds 183, unless you can use the ''[https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/closer-connection-exception-to-the-substantial-presence-test closer country exception]'', you are a US taxable person for that year.

For the year of arrival, it is generally possible to apply ''split year'' tax treatment, so that you do not suffer US tax on income that occurred before you moved to the US.&lt;ref name="split year"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/taxation-of-dual-status-aliens| title=Taxation of Dual-Status Aliens| publisher=IRS| accessdate=October 8, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, electing this has some potential disadvantages. You cannot use the US standard deduction, and you cannot file a joint return with a spouse.&lt;ref name="pub501"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-publication-501| title=About Publication 501, Dependents, Standard Deduction, and Filing Information| publisher=IRS| accessdate=October 9, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these disadvantages may increase your US tax liability relative to a similarly situated US citizen.

After the year of arrival, assuming you remain in the US, under the ''substantial presence test'' you will be a full US taxable person for the years that follow. For those years, you will be able to use the normal deductions and filing statuses available to US citizens.&lt;ref name="pub501" /&gt;

Once you are a US taxable person — that is, you pass one of these two tests — your ''entire worldwide income'' is instantly subject to full annual US taxation and reporting.

===J, F, M and Q visa holders===

If you moved to the US for employment, and do not have a green card, it is likely that you have either an H or an L visa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/visa-information-resources/all-visa-categories.html| title=Directory of Visa Categories| publisher=US Department of State| accessdate=October 12, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; For these visas, the ''substantial presence test'' applies. However, J, F, M and Q visa holders can exclude a few calendar years, so effectively delaying (or entirely avoiding) becoming US taxable persons.&lt;ref name="substantial presence test"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/substantial-presence-test| title=Substantial Presence Test| publisher=IRS| accessdate=October 8, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/individuals/taxation-of-alien-individuals-by-immigration-status-j-1| title=Taxation of Alien Individuals by Immigration Status – J-1| publisher=IRS| accessdate=October 8, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p4011.pdf| title=Publication 4011, VITA/TCE Foreign Student and Scholar Resource Guide| publisher=IRS| accessdate=December 20, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the US has a special rule for any capital gains that you realise as a US nonresident alien living temporarily in the US on a J, F, M or Q visa. If you are present for 183 days or more, you become liable for a flat 30% tax rate on your worldwide&lt;ref name="worldwide" group="note"&gt;The IRS instructions say that you pay this 30% tax on 'US source' capital gains, but for this case it uses a special definition of 'US source' that in practice covers your ''worldwide'' capital gains if you are present for 183 days or more. For more, see: {{cite web| url=https://thewolfgroup.com/blog/common-tax-mistakes-made-by-g-4-visa-holders-working-for-the-united-nations/| title=Common Tax Mistakes Made by G-4 Visa Holders Working for the United Nations| publisher=The Wolf Group| accessdate=December 6, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; capital gains.&lt;ref name="183 days"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/the-taxation-of-capital-gains-of-nonresident-alien-students-scholars-and-employees-of-foreign-governments| title=The Taxation of Capital Gains of Nonresident Alien Students, Scholars and Employees of Foreign Governments| publisher=IRS| accessdate=January 23, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; This 183 days test is unrelated to the 183 days of the ''substantial presence test''.

Also, except for students from India,&lt;ref group=note&gt;Students from India may be able to use Article 21(2) of the US/India tax treaty to benefit from the US standard deduction and other US tax exemptions usually available only to US citizens and residents. For more, see: {{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/businesses/international-businesses/india-tax-treaty-documents| title=India - Tax Treaty Documents| publisher=IRS| accessdate=August 6, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; US nonresident aliens cannot generally use any US tax exemptions or the standard deduction, and if married, can only file their US taxes as Married Filing Jointly if their spouse is a US resident or US citizen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/nonresident-alien-figuring-your-tax| title=Nonresident Alien Figuring Your Tax| publisher=IRS| accessdate=January 23, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If you later transition to an H or L visa, or a green card, you immediately lose any benefits of staying outside the US tax system yet living in the US under a J or similar visa.

===A and G visa holders===

Foreign government related individuals can hold A and G visas. These operate for US tax purposes similarly to [[#J, F, M and Q visa holders|J, F, M and Q visas]]. Holders of these visas, ''apart from'' A-3 and G-5 holders, are also exempt from the ''substantial presence test'',&lt;ref name="substantial presence test" /&gt; and so can exclude years of presence in the US from making them fully liable for US tax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/exempt-individuals-foreign-government-related-individuals| title=Exempt Individuals: Foreign Government-Related Individuals| publisher=IRS| accessdate=July 18, 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A-3 and G-5 visa holders are specifically ''not'' considered to be foreign related government individuals, and so are ''not exempt'' from the ''substantial presence test''.

Also, again as with [[#J, F, M and Q visa holders|J, F, M and Q visa holders]], there is a special rule for any worldwide&lt;ref group="note" name="worldwide" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://thewolfgroup.com/who-we-serve/g-4-visa-holders/| title=G-4 Visa Holders| publisher=The Wolf Group| accessdate=October 30, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; capital gains that you realise as a US nonresident alien living temporarily in the US on an A or G visa; that is, a flat 30% tax if you are present for 183 days or more.&lt;ref name="183 days" /&gt;

===Timing becoming a US taxable person===

If you meet the ''substantial presence test'' for a year, your residency start date is generally the first day of presence in the US during that year. If you meet the ''green card test'', your residency start date is the first day of presence in the US as a permanent resident. The IRS provides a [https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/alien-residency-examples number of examples] of when your US tax residency begins.

If you have deferred income in a given year, it may be worthwhile to try and delay becoming a US taxable person, or if possible, making use of any window of time during which you can be physically present in the US but not yet a US tax resident. See [[#Earnings and salary|Earnings and salary]] below for more.
 
Pay particular attention to any pre-arrival trips you might make to the US. These have the potential to produce a surprising and unpleasant US tax outcome, by effectively backdating your arrival date to the date of the visit.&lt;ref group=note&gt;For example, suppose you move to the US on an H or L visa in mid-June, but spent three weeks on a training course in the US in January. Ordinarily, your arrival date would have been mid-June and failing the ''substantial presence test''. However, your January training course puts you over the ''substantial presence test'', and worse, the date you become a US taxable person is then January. So any earnings you made in March to June, and any actions you took to mitigate US tax before actually moving to the US, are now all US taxable items, potentially with disastrous results.&lt;/ref&gt;

==US tax treaties==

If there is an ''income tax treaty''&lt;ref name="treaties"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/businesses/international-businesses/united-states-income-tax-treaties-a-to-z| title=United States Income Tax Treaties - A to Z| publisher=IRS| accessdate=October 8, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; between the US and the country where you retained non-US holdings, it ''may'' offer some limited protection against US tax problems on your non-US investments and assets.&lt;ref group=note&gt;At the time of writing, the US maintains income tax treaties with Australia, Austria, Bangladesh, Barbados, Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, Chile, China, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Egypt, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Jamaica, Japan, Kazakhstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Mexico, Morocco, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Pakistan, Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sri Lanka, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Trinidad &amp; Tobago, Tunisia, Turkey, Ukraine, United Kingdom, and Venezuela.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;The US terminated its tax treaty with Hungary, effective 1st Jan 2024 for dividend withholding tax. For more, see: {{cite web| url=https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0872| title= United States’ Notification of Termination of 1979 Tax Convention with Hungary| publisher=US Treasury| date=July 15, 2022| accessdate=September 12, 2022}} Also: {{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/a-24-05.pdf| title=Announcement Regarding the Effective Date of Termination of the United States-Hungary Tax Treaty| publisher=US Treasury| date=December 29, 2023| accessdate=January 1, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

And if there is a separate ''estate tax treaty''&lt;ref name="estate tax treaties"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/estate-gift-tax-treaties-international| title=Estate &amp; Gift Tax Treaties (International)| publisher=IRS| accessdate=October 10, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; between the US and the country where you retained non-US holdings, it ''may'' offer some protection against confiscatory US estate tax on your assets, should you die while a US resident.&lt;ref group=note&gt;At the time of writing, the US maintains estate tax treaties with Australia, Austria, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, South Africa, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. The estate tax treaties with Ireland and South Africa may be deficient in important areas.&lt;/ref&gt;

Canada does not have a separate estate tax treaty with the US. Instead, the US maintains a single treaty with Canada that combines both income taxes and estate taxes. Under this combined treaty, Canadians receive protection up to the level of the US estate tax exemption allowed to US citizens, the same as generally provided by the separate US estate tax treaties for other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/businesses/international-businesses/canada-tax-treaty-documents| title=Canada - Tax Treaty Documents| publisher=IRS| accessdate=August 9, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It will be worth being familiar with any applicable treaty. However, reading treaties is not a simple exercise. Most are written in dense prose, and some exist only as an elderly basic treaty but with many clauses overridden by subsequent ''protocols''. And US income tax treaties usually contain a ''saving clause''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/businesses/tax-treaties-can-affect-your-income-tax| title=Tax Treaties Can Affect Your Income Tax| publisher=IRS| accessdate=October 12, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; that, for US residents (and US citizens), denies most treaty benefits that would mitigate US tax. For example:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/tax-policy/treaties/Documents/uktreaty.pdf| title=U.S.-U.K. income tax treaty, signed July 24, 2001, London| publisher=US Treasury| accessdate=October 12, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{blockquote|Notwithstanding any provision of this Convention except paragraph 5 of this Article, a Contracting State may tax its residents (as determined under Article 4 (Residence)), and by reason of citizenship may tax its citizens, as if this Convention had not come into effect.|US/UK tax treaty, Article 1 paragraph 4}}

==Delayed or deferred earnings and salary==

Employers often pay salary in arrears, so it is quite possible that you will receive your final non-US paycheck when a US taxable person. This can generate an unwanted and perhaps unnecessary US tax liability, because the US taxes income based on when you receive it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/what-is-taxable-and-nontaxable-income| title=What is Taxable and Nontaxable Income?| publisher=IRS| accessdate=October 8, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If you have coverage from a US income tax treaty,&lt;ref name="treaties" /&gt; this may (if not overridden by a treaty ''saving clause'') offset that issue, because treaties usually reserve taxing rights on employment income to the country in which the work was performed. Otherwise, or to avoid this issue, it is usually best to accelerate income where possible so that you receive it before becoming a US taxable person. Receiving it afterwards may lead to double-tax.

==Tax and reporting for non-US cash accounts==

{{anchor|non-US cash accounts}}The US requires you to report any non-US financial accounts above a relatively low threshold amount on 'informational' forms. You have to file these reports annually, and while they are broadly duplicative,&lt;ref name="duplicative"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/businesses/comparison-of-form-8938-and-fbar-requirements| title=Comparison of Form 8938 and FBAR Requirements| publisher=IRS| accessdate=November 4, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; one or both of the following may be required:

* [https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-8938 Form 8938], Statement of Foreign Assets. Here you list the details, income and balances of all your non-US accounts.
* [https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/report-of-foreign-bank-and-financial-accounts-fbar FinCEN Form 114], Foreign Bank Account Reporting (FBAR). Filed annually with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Center. This form can only be filed electronically. The threshold for filing is very low, just $10,000 in non-US accounts.

It is easy to overlook these forms, but the penalties for non-filing are huge, starting at $10,000 even for ''non-wilful'' errors.&lt;ref group=note&gt;In 2015, congress mandated the IRS to revise the FBAR penalty amounts upwards from $10,000 and $100,000, citing "inflation" as the reason for the increases. Notably however, the threshold non-US account balance for filing this form has remained at $10,000 since the FBAR was first introduced in 1970. Unlike the penalties for non-filing, the threshold has ''never'' been increased for inflation. For more, see: {{cite web| url=https://sherayzenlaw.com/us-taxpayers-nightmare-continues-fbar-penalty-inflation-adjustment/| title=US Taxpayers’ Nightmare Continues: FBAR Penalty Inflation Adjustment| publisher=Sherayzen Law| accessdate=June 11, 2023| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230402093520/https://sherayzenlaw.com/us-taxpayers-nightmare-continues-fbar-penalty-inflation-adjustment/| archive-date=April 2, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the [[wikipedia:Foreign_Account_Tax_Compliance_Act|Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act]] (FATCA) passed into law in 2010, a number of non-US financial institutions now regularly refuse accounts to US citizens and US residents, and some may unilaterally close the accounts of anyone who becomes a US citizen or US resident. You will want to be certain that any non-US bank or other financial institution you hold accounts with will allow you to maintain those accounts after you have become a US taxable person. Under FATCA, non-US banks must provide the IRS with details of the assets of, and interest and dividend payments made to, US residents and US citizens.&lt;ref group=note&gt;The actual mechanism here is generally that non-US banks report information to their ''local'' tax authorities, and these authorities then forward that information to the IRS under cover of FATCA ''intergovernmental agreements'' (IGA).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-US savings accounts and other interest-paying accounts===

As well as reporting the existence of any non-US savings or interest bearing accounts annually on Form 8938 and FinCEN Form 114, you also need to report any interest income you receive from these accounts as US taxable income. US banks will send Form 1099 to investors to inform them of the taxable interest they have received, but you will probably not receive these forms from non-US banks.

Without a Form 1099, you have to account for the interest yourself on your US tax return, computing the USD equivalent to whatever you received, and using the exchange rate in effect on the date of payment. If your foreign bank pays you interest monthly, this can quickly become a huge workload. Also, non-US savings accounts that are tax-sheltered or tax-free in the country where the account is based are generally not sheltered from US tax. For example, a UK cash [[UK Individual Savings Accounts|Individual Savings Account]] (ISA) is fully taxable to the US for a US resident.

In many cases, the best way to handle this problem is to simply cash in these accounts before becoming a US resident, convert the balance to USD and transfer it into your US accounts, and then re-invest the money in US savings accounts once you are a US resident.

==Non-US investment accounts==

As with [[#non-US cash accounts|non-US cash accounts]] above, these accounts need to be reported on [https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-8938 Form 8938] and [https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/report-of-foreign-bank-and-financial-accounts-fbar FinCEN Form 114] if you meet the asset limits for reporting. These 'informational' reports generally include non-US pensions as well as any and all other non-US investment accounts. Also similarly to non-US cash accounts, any investment accounts you hold in non-US financial institutions are at risk of closure, if these financial institutions have a policy of avoiding US FATCA reporting.

===PFIC tax penalty for non-US taxable accounts===

Directly holding shares or bonds poses no particular problems, but any ETFs, funds, investment trusts or other collective investment vehicles held before becoming a US taxable person are ''very likely'' to be non-US domiciled, making them [[Passive foreign investment company|passive foreign investment companies]] (PFICs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://hodgen.com/what-is-a-pfic/| title=What is a PFIC?| publisher=HodgenLaw PC| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231201190432/https://hodgen.com/what-is-a-pfic/| archive-date=December 1, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The US tax rules on PFICs are harsh to the extent that they entirely discourage ownership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://creativeplanning.com/international/insights/americans-should-avoid-non-us-mutual-funds/|title=Americans Should Avoid Owning Shares in a Non-U.S. Mutual Fund|last=Healy | first=Roger| date=2022 |publisher= Creative Planning | accessdate=June 11, 2023| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230401051301/https://creativeplanning.com/international/insights/americans-should-avoid-non-us-mutual-funds/| archive-date=April 1, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; But because US tax laws for US domiciled ETFs held by nonresident aliens are also [[Nonresident alien taxation|harsh]], most nonresident aliens will [[Nonresident alien investors and Ireland domiciled ETFs|prefer non-US domiciled funds and ETFs]]. This makes it probable that any existing investments you hold on moving to the US are PFICs. If you hold any non-US domiciled funds or ETFs, your main defence against PFIC issues is to sell these before you become a US taxable person.

===No "step-up" in US basis on becoming resident===

{{anchor|taxable accounts}}Beyond this, in all cases you should also consider selling (and then potentially repurchasing) any assets you own that have a built-in and as yet unrealised capital gain. The US taxes capital gains based on the difference between the USD value at purchase and the USD value at sale,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc409| title=Topic No. 409 Capital Gains and Losses| publisher=IRS| accessdate=October 9, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; and provides no step-up in basis for when you move to the US.&lt;ref name="carltonfields"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.carltonfields.com/files/Uploads/Documents/all/us-pre-immigration-tax-planning-brochure-english.pdf| title=US Pre-Immigration Tax Planning| publisher=Carlton Fields| accessdate=October 9, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without washing away any capital gains before moving to the US, you could find yourself having to pay a large and unnecessary US capital gains tax on gains that occurred years or even decades before you set foot in the US.

Long-term bonds and CD-like saving holdings that you took out before becoming a US resident may pay out their interest after you become a US taxable person. In this case, investigate if it is possible to allocate any part of the interest payment to periods before becoming a US resident.

===Non-US tax-advantaged accounts lose their tax advantage===

Unless any applicable US tax treaty&lt;ref name="treaties" /&gt; specifically mentions them,&lt;ref group=note&gt;This happens rarely, if ever.&lt;/ref&gt; any non-US accounts that are not pensions, but are tax-advantaged or tax-free to residents of the country in which they are based, lose their special status and become taxable to the US when you are a US resident. Examples include UK [[UK Individual Savings Accounts|Individual Savings Accounts]] (ISA), Canadian [[finiki:Tax-Free Savings Account|Tax-Free Savings Accounts]] (TFSA), Japanese [[Investing from Japan#Nippon Individual Savings Accounts (NISA)|NISA]] accounts, and French [[Wikipedia:fr:Assurance-vie en France|Assurance-vie]] and [[Wikipedia:fr:Plan d'Épargne en Actions|Plan d'Épargne en Actions]] accounts.

For all such accounts, consider closing or collapsing them before becoming a US taxable person. If this is not possible, or not desirable, at the minimum you should ensure that they contain no PFICs. The most likely, but cleanest, US tax outcome is that the US will treat these as ordinary unwrapped taxable investment accounts. Less clean is if the US treats them as foreign trusts.

In all cases, as with [[#taxable accounts|taxable accounts]] above, you will want to wash away any capital gains in these accounts ''before'' becoming a US taxable person. The advantage with these accounts is that you will generally incur no non-US capital gains taxes by doing this while still a resident in the country where the accounts are located. Conversely, if any assets in the accounts have built-in capital losses, it may be worth deferring selling these until ''after'' you are a US resident, so that you can then use these losses to offset any future US capital gains taxes.

===Non-US pensions may lose pension status===

A few US tax treaties&lt;ref name="treaties" /&gt; cover non-US and cross-border pensions well,&lt;ref group=note&gt;The US tax treaties with the UK and Canada are known 'good' treaties in this respect.&lt;/ref&gt; but where one does not, this can leave you with a problematic and unpleasant situation where you hold a non-US pension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irsmedic.com/blog/2015/03/foreign-retirement-plan-taxable.html| title=Is your foreign retirement or pension plan taxable? Is it reportable?| publisher=IRS Medic| accessdate=June 11, 2023| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220814001100/https://www.irsmedic.com/blog/2019/02/irs-form-3520-a.html| archive-date=August 14, 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether or not they are exempt by treaty from annual US taxation, pensions are ''not exempt'' from [https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-8938 Form 8938] and [https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/report-of-foreign-bank-and-financial-accounts-fbar FinCEN Form 114] reporting.

If your pension is not covered by treaty but you can collapse or otherwise unwind it, it can be worth doing this before becoming a US taxable person. Otherwise, a number of US tax treatments are possible,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.bdo.com/insights/tax/private-client-services/foreign-trusts-from-a-united-states-perspective-ta| title=Foreign Trusts From a United States Perspective: Taxpayer Nightmares and How to Keep Them from Happening| publisher=BDO| accessdate=October 9, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; but most if not all can often lead to double-tax on pensions; once annually to the US while assets grow, then again to the country where the pension is located on withdrawals.

For cases not covered by treaty, and where you cannot or do not wish to collapse or unwind your pension, you may have little, or even no, defence against this unpleasant and costly US tax treatment. Damage limitation may be your only option. As with other account types above, making sure that the accounts contain no PFICs and washing away any built-in gains before becoming a US taxable person are usually sensible moves. You might also consider holding only your lower growth assets in these pensions, to try to further reduce any double-tax outcomes.

Depending on the nature of your non-US pension, you may find yourself having to complete one or more of the following forms:
* [https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-8833 Form 8833], Treaty-Based Return Position Disclosure. Used to claim tax treaty benefits.
* [https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-8621 Form 8621], Information Return by a Shareholder of a Passive Foreign Investment Company (PFIC). Extremely time-consuming, but required if you hold any non-US domiciled funds or ETFs. The IRS's estimated time to complete this form is over 48 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/instructions/i8621| title=Instructions for Form 8621| publisher=IRS| accessdate=November 3, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-3520 Form 3520], Annual Return to Report Transactions With Foreign Trusts and Receipt of Certain Foreign Gifts. For any activity involving non-US trusts, and also for gifts and bequests from non-US sources above $100,000.
* [https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-3520-A Form 3520-A], Annual Information Return of Foreign Trust with a US Owner. Required if you own a non-US trust. Another extremely time-consuming and complex form.

==Non-US real estate==

{{anchor|visa uncertainties}}Non-US real estate can produce several of the most vexing problems for new US residents. Moving to the US on a work visa, for example H or L, is an uncertain prospect. Your US residency status is entirely dependent on your employment, and if you lose or leave your job, you have just 60 days in which to either find another job with an employer willing to sponsor an H visa,&lt;ref group=note&gt;If the annual H-1B visa cap has already been reached, this may not be possible. For more, see: {{cite web| url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-1B_visa#Congressional_yearly_numerical_cap_and_exemptions| title=H-1B visa § Congressional yearly numerical cap and exemptions| publisher=Wikipedia}}&lt;/ref&gt; or leave the US to avoid becoming 'out of status' for US immigration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.alllaw.com/articles/nolo/us-immigration/what-happens-h-1b-holder-loses-job.html| title=What Happens If an H-1B Holder Loses Their Job?| publisher=NOLO| accessdate=October 10, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Retaining your non-US principal residence===

Because of the visa uncertainties [[#visa uncertainties|outlined above]], it is common for people moving from other countries to the US to retain ownership of their previous home, perhaps renting it out, until they are certain that their residency in the US is secure. This period can extend for several years, perhaps while waiting for permanent residency (green card) processing. However, these actions do not intersect well with US tax laws.
 
====Tax on rental income====

If you keep your home in your previous country, and rent it out while a US resident, your rental income is fully taxable to the US.&lt;ref group=note&gt;This usually results in a negative cash-flow. Suppose you rent your non-US home out for $2,000/month, and at the same time rent a home in the US for the same $2,000/month. You might think this would be neutral, but because of tax, it is not. The $2,000 you receive in rent is taxable income, but the $2,000 you pay in rent is not tax-deductible. As a result, you will lose out, to the extent of your marginal tax rate, so perhaps $500/month or more in deadweight tax cost.&lt;/ref&gt; You will be able to claim some rental expenses,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc414| title=Topic No. 414 Rental Income and Expenses| publisher=IRS| accessdate=October 10, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; but these are limited.

You can also claim depreciation on your non-US home rental, but the depreciation benefit is lower for non-US properties than it is for US ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://silvertaxgroup.com/foreign-rental-property-depreciation/| title=Understanding Foreign Rental Property Depreciation and IRS Income Guidelines| publisher=Silver Tax Group| accessdate=October 10, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Capital gains tax on sale====

In many countries, selling your principal home is entirely free of capital gains tax. However, the US limits tax-free gains. You can exclude up to $250,000 per individual if you have lived in this home for two of the past five years, otherwise there is no capital gains exclusion, and the entire gain on the property is US taxable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc701| title=Topic No. 701 Sale of Your Home| publisher=IRS| accessdate=October 10, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; This rule applies to all property sales, and entirely ignores that you perhaps owned your home for years or even decades before becoming a US resident or US taxable person.

Moreover, the US measures the gain from purchase price ''in USD'' to sale price ''in USD'', with no step-up on becoming a US resident.&lt;ref name="carltonfields" /&gt; This can mean that, as with stocks and other investments mentioned above, you may end up with a US capital gains tax liability for gains that occurred years or decades before you set foot in the US.

Some countries may offer a way to enter into a transaction that results in you 'resetting' your basis in a property for US tax purposes, without the property changing actual ownership. If it does, it will be well worthwhile considering doing this before becoming a US resident.

Otherwise, the only way to mitigate this is to either be sure to sell the property before exceeding the 'two of the past five years' rule, or to continue to own it until you have left the US and escaped from its 'tax net'.

====Tax on 'phantom' gains due to currency effects on sale====

Because the gain is measured as the difference between the house price ''in USD at the rate in effect at the time of purchase'' and the house sale proceeds ''in USD at the rate in effect at the time of sale'', there may be a gain (or loss) due purely to foreign exchange rate differences.

It is entirely possible to recognise a non-USD ''loss'' on selling a property that becomes a phantom USD ''gain'' solely because of exchange rate changes over the period of ownership. Unfortunately, you will have to pay the US tax on the ''phantom'' property gain with ''real'' money.

====Tax on 'phantom' gains when repaying a foreign mortgage====

If you pay off — or even make normal repayments on — a non-US mortgage, whether or not these repayments are related to selling a non-US property, you may have to pay further US tax due to foreign exchange rate changes. The US views repayments on a non-US mortgage as a potential currency gain, making it a taxable event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.ustaxfs.com/foreign-mortgage-repayment-exchange-rate-gain/| title=Foreign Mortgage Repayment and Exchange Rate Gain| publisher=US Tax &amp; Financial Services| accessdate=October 10, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a second way in which the US can tax a ''phantom'' property gain.

====Depreciation recapture tax====

If you rented out your house, then on selling it the gain attributable to depreciation is taxable at US income tax rates, rather than at capital gains tax rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depreciation_recapture_(United_States)| title=Depreciation recapture (United States)| publisher=Wikipedia| accessdate=October 12, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is true ''whether or not you actually claimed this depreciation'' against your US tax during the rental period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/faqs/capital-gains-losses-and-sale-of-home/property-basis-sale-of-home-etc/property-basis-sale-of-home-etc-5| title=Property (Basis, Sale of Home, etc.)| publisher=IRS| accessdate=October 1, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; These tax rules yet again have the effect of further increasing your US tax liability on selling a property.

===Retaining your non-US investment real estate===

If you own investment real estate that is not your principal residence, then all of the tax rules for principal residence above apply. That is, [[#Tax on rental income|tax on rental income]], [[#Capital gains tax on sale|capital gains tax on sale]], [[#Tax on 'phantom' gains due to currency effects on sale|tax due to currency effects]], [[#Tax on 'phantom' gains when repaying a foreign mortgage|tax due to foreign mortgage repayments]], and [[#Depreciation recapture tax|depreciation recapture tax]].

The only difference is that you no longer have a two-year selling window for a $250,000 'principal residence' exemption for US capital gains tax, but may instead be liable for US capital gains tax on the entire gain in the property since buying it, even if you sell the very next day after becoming a US resident.

To avoid this harsh tax result, you should ''strongly consider'' selling — or otherwise 'resetting' the US basis in — any investment real estate that you own, and that has a built-in capital gain, ''before'' becoming a US resident. Conversely, if it happens to have a built-in capital loss, consider deferring the sale until ''after'' becoming a US resident; this will allow you to use the loss to offset future US capital gains taxes.

==US estate tax==
{{main article|Estate and inheritance tax}}

The US has a large estate tax exemption for citizens and [[Domicile|domiciled]] or permanent residents, but for individuals who are not [[Domicile|domiciled]] in the US, the estate tax exemption is just $60,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/some-nonresidents-with-us-assets-must-file-estate-tax-returns| title=Some Nonresidents with U.S. Assets Must File Estate Tax Returns| publisher=IRS| accessdate=October 10, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no unlimited marital exemption, unless your spouse is a US citizen. US estate tax rates for individuals not domiciled in the US are 26-40% of US assets above the $60,000 exemption.

As a new or temporary US resident, it is quite possible that you are subject to US income tax, but your domicile does not allow you to use the large US estate tax exemption for people domiciled in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estate_tax_in_the_United_States#Non-residents| title=Estate tax in the United States| publisher=Wikipedia| accessdate=October 10, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; This produces a difficult dilemma. You would only be subject to US estate tax on your 'US situs'&lt;ref group=note name="US situs"&gt;'US situs' assets would include not just everything you own physically in the US and in US based accounts, but also US company stocks and any US domiciled funds or ETFs held in any non-US accounts that you have.&lt;/ref&gt; assets (not your worldwide assets), but you cannot hold non-US domiciled funds or ETFs without running into draconian US [[Passive foreign investment company|PFIC]] tax rules, and US domiciled funds and ETFs are 'US situs' assets. In this case, you risk significant US estate tax liabilities if you hold more than $60,000 in any US based investments or assets.

If you are a national of one of the handful of countries with a US estate tax treaty,&lt;ref name="estate tax treaties" /&gt; you may be able to use that treaty to reduce or eliminate your risk of US estate tax. Otherwise, the only way to mitigate this is to either become fully domiciled in the US, or keep your 'US situs' assets to below $60,000 in total.

==US gift tax==
{{main article|Gift tax}}

Alongside its estate tax, the US also has a gift tax&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/gift-tax| title=Gift Tax| publisher=IRS| accessdate=November 21, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; that may affect you if you become a US resident. It applies to gifts above an annual limit (exclusion), and shares its exemption with that of the estate tax.

In general, gifts to a spouse may be unlimited, and do not trigger US gift taxes. However, a gift to a ''non-US citizen'' spouse (even if they are themselves a US resident or green card holder) is subject to an annual limit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/frequently-asked-questions-on-gift-taxes| title=Frequently Asked Questions on Gift Taxes| publisher=IRS| accessdate=November 21, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To avoid tangling with US gift taxes, consider making any planned sizeable gifts ''before'' becoming a US taxable person.

==US state income taxes==
{{main article|State income taxes}}

State income tax is too complex and disparate to fully cover here, but as a general rule, if you live in a state with an income tax, everything listed above that is federally taxable will have a state tax that is payable on top.

In addition, several states do not honour US income tax treaties.&lt;ref group=note&gt;For example, California famously does not recognise [[finiki:Registered Retirement Savings Plan|Canadian retirement accounts]] as tax-deferred. For more, see: {{cite web| url=https://cardinalpointwealth.com/2015/05/27/california-residents-does-your-financial-advisor-tax-manage-your-rrsps/| title=California Residents: Does Your Financial Advisor Tax-Manage Your RRSPs?| publisher=Cardinal Point Wealth Management| accessdate=Dec 14, 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can mean that gains in a non-US pension that are not taxable federally may nevertheless still be taxable annually to your state of residence. And it can create ridiculously complex scenarios, and also often leads directly to double-tax — once when the gains accrue, and then again when you make withdrawals. This is a particular issue if you move to a different state or country for retirement.

==Becoming a green card holder or US citizen==

One common way to alleviate [[#visa uncertainties|visa uncertainties]] caused by your US visa being tied to your job is to apply for US permanent residency (a [[wikipedia:Green_card|green card]]). However, while this will make your position as a US resident more secure, it comes with a series of drawbacks that may prove unpalatable, particularly for high net worth individuals.

Once approved for US [[wikipedia:Green_card|Lawful Permanent Resident]] (LPR, ''green card'') status, your entire worldwide income is fully taxable to the US, no matter where in the world you live.&lt;ref name="cbt"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/taxpayers-living-abroad| title=Taxpayers Living Abroad| publisher=IRS| accessdate=November 2, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike all other developed nations, the US taxes not only on residency, but also on citizenship, and US LPRs are 'deemed' to be fully US taxable under citizenship-based taxation, even though not actually US citizens.

To free yourself from US tax as an LPR, you must generally affirmatively surrender your green card using USCIS [https://www.uscis.gov/i-407 Form I-407]. If you do not do this, you remain a US taxable person even if your physical green card (and very probably also your US immigration status) has expired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.angloinfo.com/blogs/global/us-tax/tax-court-affirms-informal-relinquishment-of-green-card-not-enough/| title=Tax Court Confirms It — “Informal” Relinquishment of Green Card NOT Enough!| publisher=Angloinfo| accessdate=September 19, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If you become a US citizen, and wish to free yourself from US tax, your only option is to renounce US citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal/travel-legal-considerations/us-citizenship/Relinquishing-US-Nationality-Abroad.html| title=Relinquishing U.S. Nationality Abroad| publisher=U.S. Department of State| accessdate=April 16, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|Expatriation tax}}In both cases, this may subject you to the US [[US tax pitfalls for a US person living abroad#Expatriation tax|expatriation tax]]. This is an unpleasant tax that includes US capital gains tax on a 'deemed' disposition of assets with built-in gains, full and immediate US income tax on 'deemed' withdrawal of the value of any pensions and retirement savings (even when not actually withdrawn, and perhaps not even ''withdrawable'', if non-US), and a harsh 40% transfer tax on any subsequent gifts or bequests to US persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.withersworldwide.com/en-gb/insight/expatriation-and-compliance-what-you-need-to-know-now| title=Expatriation and compliance: What you need to know now| publisher=Withers Worldwide| accessdate=October 12, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given the above, it is worth thinking ''very carefully indeed'' about whether or not becoming a green card holder or US citizen is a sensible move. If you are a temporary US resident, or if you do not plan to spend the rest of your life in the US, it may be better to stick to employment-based visas exclusively. Many US immigration professionals now recommend this, in preference to obtaining a green card.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://hodgen.com/leaving-the-usa-and-leaving-u-s-tax-law-behind-you/| title=Leaving the USA and leaving U.S. tax law behind you| publisher=HodgenLaw PC| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240212083541/https://hodgen.com/leaving-the-usa-and-leaving-u-s-tax-law-behind-you/| archive-date=February 12, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Temporarily leaving the US==
If you hold a green card, and intend to spend a period of several months outside the US, you may need to apply for a ''reentry permit''. From USCIS:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/document/guides/B5en.pdf| title=How do I get a reentry permit?| publisher=USCIS| accessdate=January 21, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{blockquote|A lawful permanent resident (LPR) normally may travel outside the United States and return; however, there are some limitations. A reentry permit can help prevent two types of problems:
* Your Permanent Resident Card becomes technically invalid for reentry into the United States if you are absent from the United States for 1 year or more.
* Your U.S. permanent residence may be considered as abandoned for absences shorter than 1 year if you take up residence in another country.
A reentry permit establishes that you did not intend to abandon status, and it allows you to apply for admission to the United States after traveling abroad for up to 2 years without having to obtain a returning resident visa. Reentry permits are normally valid for 2 years from the date of issuance.|USCIS Guide B5, How do I get a reentry permit?}}
As noted [[#Becoming a green card holder or US citizen|above]], your entire worldwide earnings and assets remain both taxable and reportable to the US. You may be able to claim tax treaty benefits to reduce any US tax, but doing so runs the risk of involuntary [[#Expatriation tax|expatriation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://hodgen.com/green-card-treaty-election-exit-tax-danger/| title=Green card + treaty election = exit tax danger| publisher=HodgenLaw PC| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230930225418/https://hodgen.com/green-card-treaty-election-exit-tax-danger/| archive-date=September 30, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reentry permits are intended for temporary absence from the US, although there is no definition of ''temporary'' in the law or regulations surrounding them. They cannot be extended. You can apply for more than one, and must be physically present in the US to apply. There is no regulation that limits how many you can have, but issuance is at the discretion of the USCIS processing officer. Processing officers are required to assess the circumstances of an application, including any history of past applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.uscis.gov/policy-manual/volume-11-part-c| title=Policy Manual: Part C - Reentry Permits| publisher=USCIS| accessdate=January 21, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Permanently leaving the US==

===Departing alien clearance===
Non-US citizens who leave the US are ''technically'' required to obtain a ''departure permit'' (also called a ''sailing permit'').&lt;ref name="1040c"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/departing-alien-clearance-sailing-permit| title=Departing Alien Clearance (Sailing Permit)| publisher=IRS| accessdate=January 21, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;The use of the term ''sailing permit'' provides a clue to the outdated nature of this requirement.&lt;/ref&gt;

Obtaining this certificate requires filing one of the following forms:
* [https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-2063 Form 2063], U.S. Departing Alien Income Tax Statement. Requests IRS certification that all U.S. income tax obligations have been satisfied.
* [https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-1040-c Form 1040-C], U.S. Departing Alien Income Tax Return. Reports income received or expected to be received for the entire tax year, with payment if required.

You cannot file these forms by mail or online, but only in person at selected IRS offices. Filing may require you to supply copious documents supporting all of your received and expected income for the year.&lt;ref name="1040c" /&gt; Again ''technically'', these forms apply not only to green card holders, but also to holders of a work visa such as H or L. Also, ''technically'' they apparently apply to ''any'' departure from the US, even temporary ones, for example a short vacation.

This is all ''technically''. In practice, neither the IRS nor USCIS has enforced this requirement in decades, and compliance is virtually nonexistent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-10-429.pdf| title=GAO-10-429 Tax Compliance: IRS May Be Able to Improve Compliance for Nonresident Aliens and Updating Requirements Could Reduce Their Compliance Burden| publisher=GAO| date=April 2010 |accessdate=October 4, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, a cautious green card holder (or even work visa holder) wishing to make a clean and entirely indisputable exit from the US might want to jump through this almost entirely pointless bureaucratic hoop. 

===Disconnecting from the IRS===
{{see also|US tax pitfalls for a US person living abroad#Expatriation tax|Taxation as a US person living abroad#Expatriation tax for losing citizenship or permanent residency|label 1=US tax pitfalls for a US person living abroad § Expatriation tax|label 2=Taxation as a US person living abroad § Expatriation tax for losing citizenship or permanent residency}}

If you surrender your green card, or [[wikipedia:Relinquishment_of_United_States_nationality|renounce]] US citizenship, after leaving the US, you may be subject to the ''expatriation tax'', discussed [[#Expatriation tax|above]]. Otherwise, if you are in the US on a work visa such as H or L, the process is simpler and less costly.

For your final year in the US, you generally can (and often should) choose ''split year'' treatment, so that any income or other financial moves you make after leaving the US are not taxed by the US.&lt;ref name="split year" /&gt; The only time you might consider not using this is if you leave the US very close to or exactly at the end of the calendar year.

===Leaving US accounts behind when you go===

Once you are no longer a US taxable person, file a [https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-w-8-ben form W-8BEN] with the provider for any US accounts that you leave behind when you depart the US. This will override the [https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-w-9 form W-9] you may have used to open the account, and will allow you to claim any applicable US tax treaty benefits relating to that account. You file these forms with the account providers, not with the IRS.

====US taxable accounts====

For any US based taxable accounts you hold, your likely best action is to close them and transfer the proceeds to your new country. If you do not do this, you risk substantial US estate taxes if your new country does not have a US estate tax treaty.&lt;ref name="estate tax treaties" /&gt; And if your new country lacks a US income tax treaty,&lt;ref name="treaties" /&gt; you will overpay US tax on dividends relative to holding non-US accounts.

Even for cases where there are good treaties in place, it will usually be much cleaner and easier to manage a local taxable portfolio than one now held in a foreign (to you) country.

====US retirement accounts====

If you have saved into a US based retirement plan, such as a [[401(k)|401k]] or [[IRA]], you may face challenges managing it once no longer a US resident. For example, some or all of the following:
* US provider restricts your trading, or other account activity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.fidelity.com/accounts/services/investors_outside_US_faq.shtml| title=FAQs for Investors Living Outside the US| publisher=Fidelity| accessdate=February 14, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;For an instance of this created by Vanguard policy, see {{Forum link| t=433099| title=US Nonresident Aliens - Vanguard freezing legacy accounts| date=June 5, 2024}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* US provider unilaterally closes your account entirely,
* US provider fails to correctly apply, or refuses to apply, US tax treaty withholding rates,&lt;ref group="note" name="Vanguard_NRA"&gt;For example, see {{Forum link| t=425046| title=Vanguard makes life difficult for NRAs in the UK and India| date=February 21, 2024}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* US provider withholds US tax on fully tax-free Roth withdrawals,&lt;ref group="note" name="Vanguard_NRA" /&gt;
* US provider incorrectly reports US tax withholding amounts,
* Perpetual risk of US estate taxes (except if covered by a US estate tax treaty&lt;ref name="estate tax treaties" /&gt;),
* Potential higher US tax rates on withdrawals than those of US residents,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://hodgen.com/ira-distributions-for-noncovered-expatriates/| title=IRA Distributions for Noncovered Expatriates| publisher=HodgenLaw PC| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231026053731/https://hodgen.com/ira-distributions-for-noncovered-expatriates/| archive-date=October 26, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Potential home country tax annually on gains inside the pension,
* Risk of double-tax under home country or US inheritance or estate tax rules,&lt;ref group="note"&gt;For details specific to the UK, see: [[Investing from the UK for US citizens and US permanent residents#US and UK inheritance and estate taxes|Investing from the UK for US citizens and US permanent residents]]. Also {{Forum link| p=8244728| title=Re: Summary of 401K/IRA taxation for US 'tax resident' living in the UK?| date=February 8, 2025}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and
* Political risk of future US tax laws that are hostile to US nonresident aliens.

Similar difficulties apply to any other US tax-advantaged accounts you might have acquired during your stay in the US, for example a [[Health savings account]] (HSA). While it may be possible to withdraw early from these accounts, there is generally a tax penalty for doing so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc557| title=Topic No. 557 Additional Tax on Early Distributions from Traditional and Roth IRAs| publisher=IRS| accessdate=October 15, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/publications/p969| title=Publication 969, Health Savings Accounts and Other Tax-Favored Health Plans| publisher=IRS| accessdate=July 12, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If you do not plan on retiring in the US, you should consider very carefully whether it is sensible to participate at all in a 401k, IRA, HSA or any other US tax-advantaged account. It is however usually worthwhile to participate in an employer 401k at least up to the maximum employer match, provided this match more than offsets any early withdrawal penalty you might have to pay.

====US social security====

If you have paid US [[payroll tax]] (also known as FICA tax), you may be eligible for [[Social Security|social security]] payments when you reach retirement age. Eligibility depends on having at least 40 credits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.ssa.gov/benefits/retirement/planner/credits.html| title=Benefits Planner - Social Security Credits and Benefit Eligibility| publisher=SSA| accessdate=November 21, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, you gain this from 40 quarters of salaried work in the US. If you have fewer than 40 credits, it may be possible to have these credits applied to your non-US country's pension system, using a 'totalization agreement'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.ssa.gov/international/agreements_overview.html| title=International Programs - U.S. International Social Security Agreements| publisher=SSA| accessdate=November 21, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

US social security is payable to non-US residents and nonresident aliens, but there are restrictions for residents and citizens of some countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.ssa.gov/pubs/EN-05-10137.pdf| title=EN-05-10137 - Your Payments While You are Outside the United States (June 2020)| publisher=SSA| accessdate=November 21, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some limited circumstances, to remain eligible requires you to spend 30 days in the US every six months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.ssa.gov/OP_Home/handbook/handbook.18/handbook-1843.html| title=SSA Handbook section 1843| publisher=SSA| accessdate=January 15, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; US social security payments to all non-US residents are also subject to somewhat more onerous restrictions than payments made to US residents.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;For example, the ''Foreign Work Test'' for non-US residents: {{cite web| url=https://www.ssa.gov/OP_Home/handbook/handbook.18/handbook-1823.html| title=SSA Handbook, section 1823| publisher=SSA| accessdate=January 15, 2023}} Compare to the ''Earnings Test'' applied to US residents: {{cite web| url=https://www.ssa.gov/OP_Home/handbook/handbook.18/handbook-1801.html| title=SSA Handbook section 1801| publisher=SSA| accessdate=January 15, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social security payments made by the US to nonresident aliens are subject to 30% US withholding tax on 85% of the amount paid, so 25.5%. A treaty may reduce this withholding rate, perhaps to 0%.&lt;ref name="treaties" /&gt;

===FIRPTA and selling your US home===

If you own a home in the US, you should generally sell it before leaving the US, and while you are still a US taxable person. Otherwise, you face a potential large tax penalty from the US [[wikipedia:Foreign_Investment_in_Real_Property_Tax_Act|Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act]] (FIRPTA). This tax requires US nonresident aliens to pay US income tax rates on any gains in the value of US real estate, and so leaving you in a worse tax position that a similarly situated US citizen. Once you stop being a US taxable person, you become a US nonresident alien.

FIRPTA also applies a sizeable US tax withholding against the full proceeds of any sale of US real estate by a nonresident alien. The rate is generally 15% of the full property sale price, although some exceptions to this may apply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/firpta-withholding| title=FIRPTA Withholding| publisher=IRS| accessdate=October 12, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; You will have to file a US [https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-1040-nr 1040-NR] nonresident alien tax return to recover any over-withheld amount.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' contains supporting analysis for various tax situations.

{{Notice|This article is intended for ''math enthusiasts'' who want to understand the underlying details. Investors without a math background can safely skip this information.}}

==Taxable account performance==
{{Main|Taxable account#Performance}}

Define variables:
:&lt;math&gt;t = \text{time}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;V(t) = \text{investment value at time t}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;V(0) = \text{initial investment value}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;B(t) = \text{investment basis at time t}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;B(0) = \text{initial investment basis}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;V_{at}(t) = \text{investment value at time t}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;r = \text{overall rate of return}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;y = \text{investment yield}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;tr_{div} = \text{tax rate on dividends}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;tr_{cg} = \text{tax rate on capital gains}&lt;/math&gt;

For simplicity and clarity, this derivation will assume continuous compounding, but the formula may be modified for period compounding as desired. Continuous compounding formulas use exponentials of base ''e'' &lt;math&gt;\approx&lt;/math&gt; 2.71828. The value of the investment at any future time ''t'' can be written as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;V(t) = V(0) \cdot e^{(r-y \cdot tr_{div})t}&lt;/math&gt;

Calculating the basis at any time ''t'' requires integration. The rate of change of the basis at any time ''t'' is equal to the value at ''t'', multiplied by the yield, multiplied by (1 - &lt;math&gt;tr_{div}&lt;/math&gt;). The product of &lt;math&gt;V(t) \cdot y \cdot tr_{div}&lt;/math&gt; is the rate of loss to dividend taxes, and the remainder is added to the cost basis:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dB(t)}{dt} = V(t) \cdot y \cdot (1-tr_{div}) = V(0) \cdot y \cdot (1-tr_{div}) \cdot e^{(r-y \cdot tr_{div})t}&lt;/math&gt;

Integrating this formula (using a Computer Algebra System) from 0 to ''t'' gives:

:&lt;math&gt;B(t) = \int_{0}^{t}\ V(0) \cdot y \cdot (1-tr_{div}) \cdot e^{(r-y \cdot tr_{div})\tau}d\tau = B(0) + \left ( \frac{V(0) \cdot y \cdot (1-tr_{div})}{r-y \cdot tr_{div}} \right ) \left ( e^{(r-y \cdot tr_{div})t}-1 \right )&lt;/math&gt;

Finally, the after-tax value after the investment is sold is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;V_{at}(t) = V(t) - \left ( V(t) - B(t) \right ) \cdot tr_{cg}&lt;/math&gt;

===Effective capital gains rate===

When &lt;math&gt;B(0) = V(0)&lt;/math&gt; (that is, when the initial investment is made at &lt;math&gt;t=0&lt;/math&gt;), the equation can be somewhat simplified to calculate an effective capital gains tax rate, defined as the capital gains tax rate if the future basis were equal to the original investment. As a shorthand, define:

:&lt;math&gt;A = \frac{V(t)}{V(0)} = e^{(r-y \cdot tr_{div})t}&lt;/math&gt;

... with continuous compounding, or:

:&lt;math&gt;A = \frac{V(t)}{V(0)} = (1 + r-y \cdot tr_{div})^{t}&lt;/math&gt;

... with periodic compounding. The effective capital gains tax rate is the value that satisfies this equation:

:&lt;math&gt;\left ( V(0) \cdot A - B(t) \right ) \cdot tr_{cg} = \left ( V(0) \cdot A - V(0) \right ) \cdot {tr_{cg}}^{*}&lt;/math&gt;

Rearranging and plugging in &lt;math&gt;B(t)&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;{tr_{cg}}^{*} = tr_{cg} \cdot \left ( \frac{V(0) \cdot A - B(t)}{V(0) \cdot A - V(0)} \right ) = tr_{cg} \cdot \left ( \frac{V(0) \cdot A - \left ( V(0) + \left ( \frac{V(0) \cdot y \cdot (1-tr_{div})}{r-y \cdot tr_{div}} \right ) \left ( A-1 \right ) \right )}{V(0) \cdot A - V(0)} \right )&lt;/math&gt;

Canceling &lt;math&gt;V(0)&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;{tr_{cg}}^{*} = tr_{cg} \cdot \left ( \frac{A - 1 - \left ( \frac{y \cdot (1-tr_{div})}{r-y \cdot tr_{div}} \right ) \left ( A-1 \right ) }{A - 1} \right )&lt;/math&gt;

Canceling &lt;math&gt;(A-1)&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;{tr_{cg}}^{*} = tr_{cg} \cdot \left ( 1 - \left ( \frac{y \cdot (1-tr_{div})}{r-y \cdot tr_{div}} \right ) \right )&lt;/math&gt;

Simplifying:

:&lt;math&gt;{tr_{cg}}^{*} = tr_{cg} \cdot \left ( \left ( \frac{r-y \cdot tr_{div}}{r-y \cdot tr_{div}} \right ) - \left ( \frac{y \cdot (1-tr_{div})}{r-y \cdot tr_{div}} \right ) \right ) = tr_{cg} \cdot \left ( \frac{r-y \cdot tr_{div} - y \cdot (1 - tr_{div})}{r-y \cdot tr_{div}} \right )&lt;/math&gt;

Further simplifying:

:&lt;math&gt;{tr_{cg}}^{*} = tr_{cg} \cdot \left ( \frac{r-y}{r-y \cdot tr_{div}} \right )&lt;/math&gt;

Using this value, the after-tax value of the investment is:

:&lt;math&gt;V_{at}(t) = V(t) - \left ( V(t) - V(0) \right ) \cdot {tr_{cg}}^{*}&lt;/math&gt;

==Derivation of tax rate boundaries for Social Security taxation==
{{Main|Taxation_of_Social_Security_benefits#Heat_map_representation}}

Variables are defined as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;SS = \text{Social Security income}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;OI = \text{other income}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;BT = \text{bracket threshold}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;SD = \text{standard deduction}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;LB = \text{lower base}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;UB = \text{upper base}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;RI = \text{relevant income} = 0.5 \cdot SS + OI&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;

===Point above which 40.7% marginal rate is possible===

The point above which 40.7% marginal tax rates is possible is when total taxable income is at the 22% tax bracket threshold and the maximum 85% of Social Security benefits are taxable. It is the combination of &lt;math&gt;SS&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;OI&lt;/math&gt; that satisfies these two equations:

:&lt;math&gt;0.85 \cdot SS + OI - SD = BT&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;0.5 \cdot (UB - LB) + 0.85 \cdot (RI - UB) = 0.85 \cdot SS&lt;/math&gt;

Rearranging the first equation to solve for OI gives:

:&lt;math&gt;OI = BT + SD - 0.85 \cdot SS&lt;/math&gt;

Save this result for later substitution. Substitute the definition of relevant income into the second equation:

:&lt;math&gt;0.5 \cdot (UB - LB) + 0.85 \cdot (OI + 0.5 \cdot SS - UB) = 0.85 \cdot SS&lt;/math&gt;

Substitute in the formula for OI from the rearranged first equation:

:&lt;math&gt;0.5 \cdot (UB - LB) + 0.85 \cdot \left ([BT + SD - 0.85 \cdot SS] + 0.5 \cdot SS - UB \right) = 0.85 \cdot SS&lt;/math&gt;

Collecting the SS terms from the left hand side:

:&lt;math&gt;0.5 \cdot (UB - LB) + 0.85 \cdot (BT + SD - UB) + 0.85 \cdot (0.5 \cdot SS - 0.85 \cdot SS) = 0.85 \cdot SS&lt;/math&gt;

Simplifying the SS terms on the left hand side:

:&lt;math&gt;0.5 \cdot (UB - LB) + 0.85 \cdot (BT + SD - UB) - 0.2975 \cdot SS = 0.85 \cdot SS&lt;/math&gt;

Solving for SS and labeling this value SS* gives:

:&lt;math&gt;SS^{*} = \dfrac{0.5 \cdot (UB - LB) + 0.85 \cdot (BT + SD - UB)}{1.1475}&lt;/math&gt;

Recalling the equation above for OI in terms of SS, and labeling this value OI* gives:

:&lt;math&gt;OI^{*} = BT + SD - 0.85 \cdot SS^{*}&lt;/math&gt;

===22.2% bump begins===

For single filers, the 22.2% bump begins in the middle of the 12% bracket when Social Security taxation begins to be taxed at an 85% marginal rate. This occurs when:

:&lt;math&gt;0.5 \cdot SS + OI = UB&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting $34,000 for UB gives:

:&lt;math&gt;OI = $34,000 - 0.5 \cdot SS&lt;/math&gt;

For married filers, the 22.2% bump begins at the boundary between the 10% and 12% brackets. The line is defined by the solution to these equations:

:&lt;math&gt;0.5 \cdot (UB - LB) + 0.85 \cdot (RI - UB) = p \cdot SS&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;OI + p \cdot SS = BT + SD&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is the percentage of Social Security income that is taxable. &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is an unknown variable, but with two equations and three unknowns it should be possible eliminate &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; through substitution. Solving for &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; in the second equation gives:

:&lt;math&gt;p = \dfrac{BT + SD - OI}{SS}&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting this value for &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; into the first equation, and also the definition of relevant income, gives:

:&lt;math&gt;0.5 \cdot (UB - LB) + 0.85 \cdot (OI + 0.5 \cdot SS - UB) = BT + SD - OI&lt;/math&gt;

Expanding the large term on the left hand side gives:

:&lt;math&gt;0.5 \cdot (UB - LB) + 0.85 \cdot OI + 0.425 \cdot SS - 0.85 \cdot UB = BT + SD - OI&lt;/math&gt;

Rearranging to solve for OI:

:&lt;math&gt;1.85 \cdot OI = BT + SD + 0.85 \cdot UB - 0.5 \cdot (UB - LB) - 0.425 \cdot SS&lt;/math&gt;

The solution to this set of equations is:

:&lt;math&gt;OI = \dfrac{BT + SD + 0.85 \cdot UB - 0.5 \cdot (UB-LB)}{1.85} - \dfrac{0.425 \cdot SS}{1.85}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\dfrac{0.425}{1.85} \approx 0.22973 \approx 0.23&lt;/math&gt;

===22.2% bump ends===

The 22.2% bump ends when the maximum of 85% of Social Security benefits becomes taxable. This occurs when:

:&lt;math&gt;0.5 \cdot (UB - LB) + 0.85 \cdot (RI - UB) = 0.85 \cdot SS&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting the definition for relevant income gives:

:&lt;math&gt;0.5 \cdot (UB - LB) + 0.85 \cdot (0.5 \cdot SS + OI - UB) = 0.85 \cdot SS&lt;/math&gt;

Expanding the large term on the left hand side gives:

:&lt;math&gt;0.5 \cdot (UB - LB) + 0.425 \cdot SS + 0.85 \cdot OI - 0.85 \cdot UB = 0.85 \cdot SS&lt;/math&gt;

Rearranging to solve for OI gives:

:&lt;math&gt;0.85 \cdot OI = 0.85 \cdot UB - 0.5 \cdot (UB - LB) + 0.425 \cdot SS&lt;/math&gt;

Dividing by 0.85 gives:

:&lt;math&gt;OI = \left ( UB - \frac{0.5}{0.85} \cdot (UB - LB) \right ) + 0.5 \cdot SS&lt;/math&gt;

===40.7% bump begins===

For both single and married filers, the 40.7% bump begins at the boundary of the 22% bracket. The formula is the same as for the beginning of the 22.2% bump for married filers, but with a different bracket threshold:

:&lt;math&gt;OI = \dfrac{BT + SD + 0.85 \cdot UB - 0.5 \cdot (UB-LB)}{1.85} - \dfrac{0.425 \cdot SS}{1.85}&lt;/math&gt;

===40.7% bump ends===

The line where the 40.7% bump ends is the same as where the 22.2% bump ends. The only difference is whether the boundary is above or below &lt;math&gt;SS^{*}&lt;/math&gt;. 

:&lt;math&gt;OI = \left ( UB - \frac{0.5}{0.85} \cdot (UB - LB) \right ) + 0.5 \cdot SS&lt;/math&gt;

==Variable Marginal Rates with Section 199A Deduction==
{{Main|Marginal_tax_rate#Section_199A_deductions}}

Define variables:
:&lt;math&gt;T(N, Q) = \text{tax liability as a function of income}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;N = \text{non-Qualified Business Income}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;Q = \text{Qualified Business Income}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;TB = \text{tax bracket (for example, 24 percent)}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;D = \text{below-the-line deduction (for example, standard deduction)}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;UL = \text{upper limit of deduction phase-out (for example, 464,200 for MFJ 2023)}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;R = \text{phase-out range (for example, 100,000 for MFJ 2023)}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;

This analysis will assume a single tax bracket, although because the equation will be differentiated, the results will apply to any tax bracket.

The total tax liability can be written as follows. If total taxable income is below the beginning of the deduction phase-out ($232,100 for single or $464,200 for MFJ, for 2023), total tax is:

:&lt;math&gt;T(N, Q) = (N+Q-D) \cdot TB - 20% \cdot Q \cdot TB&lt;/math&gt;

In the phase-out range ($182,100-$232,100 for single or $364,200-$464,200 for MFJ), total tax is:

:&lt;math&gt;T(N, Q) = (N+Q-D) \cdot TB - 20% \cdot Q \cdot \left ( \frac{UL - (Q + N - D)}{R} \right ) \cdot TB&lt;/math&gt;

Above the phase-out range ($232,100 for single or $464,200 for MFJ), total tax is:

:&lt;math&gt;T(N, Q) = (N+Q-D) \cdot TB &lt;/math&gt;

Above the phase-out, the Section 199A deduction has no effect. Below the phase-out, the marginal tax rates with respect to QBI and non-QBI are found by taking the partial derivative of T with respect to N and Q:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial T(N, Q)}{\partial N} = TB&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial T(N, Q)}{\partial Q} = (1 - 20%) \cdot TB = 80% \cdot TB&lt;/math&gt;

In the phase-out range, the marginal tax rates with respect to QBI and non-QBI are found by taking the partial derivative of T with respect to N and Q:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial T(N, Q)}{\partial N} = TB - 20% \cdot Q \cdot \left ( \frac{-1}{R} \right ) \cdot TB&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial T(N, Q)}{\partial N} = TB \cdot \left ( 1 + \frac{20% \cdot Q}{R} \right )&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial T(N, Q)}{\partial Q} = TB - \frac{\partial}{\partial Q} \left ( \frac{20% \cdot TB}{R} \cdot (UL \cdot Q - Q^2 - N \cdot Q + D \cdot Q)\right )&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial T(N, Q)}{\partial Q} = TB -  \frac{20% \cdot TB}{R} \cdot (UL - 2Q - N + D)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial T(N, Q)}{\partial Q} = TB \cdot \left ( 1 + \frac{20%}{R} \cdot (2Q + N - UL - D) \right )&lt;/math&gt;

The second partial derivatives are:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial^2 T(N, Q)}{\partial N^2} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial^2 T(N, Q)}{\partial Q^2} = \frac{2 \cdot TB \cdot 20%}{R}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial^2 T(N, Q)}{\partial Q \partial N} = \frac{TB \cdot 20%}{R}&lt;/math&gt;

===Example===

A MFJ couple has $120,000 of non-QBI income and also earns QBI. They take the standard deduction of $29,200. Below $383,900 of taxable income, they are in the 24% bracket. Their marginal tax rates for non-QBI and QBI income are:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial T(N, Q)}{\partial N} = 24%&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial T(N, Q)}{\partial Q} = 80% \cdot 24% = 19.2%&lt;/math&gt;

The phase-out begins when their taxable income, after the standard deduction, equals $383,900. This corresponds to a QBI income of '''$293,100''' ($383,900 + $29,200 - $120,000). Note that although their taxable income is at the 24%/32% threshold, the Section 199A deduction pulls them well down into the 24% bracket. At this income, their marginal tax rates are: 

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial T(N, Q)}{\partial N} = 24% \cdot \left ( 1 + \frac{20% \cdot $293,100}{$100,000} \right ) = 38.07%&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial T(N, Q)}{\partial Q} = 24% \cdot \left ( 1 + \frac{20%}{$100,000} \cdot (2 \cdot $293,100 + $120,000 - $483,900 - $29,200) \right ) = 24% \cdot \left ( 1 + \frac{20%}{$100,000} \cdot $193,100 \right ) = 33.92%&lt;/math&gt;

At some point in the phase-out range, the couple will cross into the 32% bracket, and then into the 35% bracket. At the top of the phase-out, when QBI income is '''$393,100''' ($483,900 + $29,200 - $120,000), marginal tax rates will be:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial T(N, Q)}{\partial N} = 35% \cdot \left ( 1 + \frac{20% \cdot $393,100}{$100,000} \right ) = 62.52%&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial T(N, Q)}{\partial Q} = 35% \cdot \left ( 1 + \frac{20%}{$100,000} \cdot (2 \cdot $393,100 + $120,000 - $464,200 - $29,200) \right ) = 35% \cdot \left ( 1 + \frac{20%}{$100,000} \cdot $393,100 \right ) = 62.52%&lt;/math&gt;

Above $371,900 QBI, the Section 199A deduction is completely eliminated and the marginal rates become:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial T(N, Q)}{\partial N} = \frac{\partial T(N, Q)}{\partial Q} = 35%&lt;/math&gt;

===Maximum possible rates===

By inspection of the above formulas, the maximum possible rates occur at the very top of the phase-out range, when:

:&lt;math&gt;N + Q - D = UL&lt;/math&gt;

The maximum also occurs when Q is largest, so:

:&lt;math&gt;N = 0&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;Q = UL + D&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting these values into the above equations for the marginal rates give:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial T(N, Q)}{\partial N} = TB \cdot \left ( 1 + \frac{20% \cdot (UL + D + N)}{R} \right )&lt;/math&gt;

and 

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial T(N, Q)}{\partial Q} = TB \cdot \left ( 1 + \frac{20%}{R} \cdot (2 \cdot (UL+D) + 0 - UL - D) \right ) = TB \cdot \left ( 1 + \frac{20%}{R} \cdot (UL + D) \right ) &lt;/math&gt;

Note that the two formulas are the same.

For single filers for 2023, UL = $232,100 and R = $50,000, and we will assume the standard deduction D = $13,850. $232,100 taxable income is barely in the 35% bracket, which begins at $231,250 taxable income, so TB = 35%.

:&lt;math&gt;\left (\frac{\partial T(N, Q)}{\partial N} \right )_{max} = \left (\frac{\partial T(N, Q)}{\partial Q} \right )_{max} = 35% \cdot \left ( 1 + \frac{20% \cdot ($232,100 + $13,850)}{$50,000} \right ) = 69.43%&lt;/math&gt;

The QBI required to achieve this rate is:

:&lt;math&gt;Q = $232,100 + $13,850 = $245,950&lt;/math&gt;

For married joint filers for 2023, UL = $464,200 and R = $100,000, and we will assume the standard deduction D = $27,700. $491,900 taxable income is barely into the 35% bracket, which begins at $490,200 taxable income, so TB = 35%.

:&lt;math&gt;\left (\frac{\partial T(N, Q)}{\partial N} \right )_{max} = \left (\frac{\partial T(N, Q)}{\partial Q} \right )_{max} = 35% \cdot \left ( 1 + \frac{20% \cdot ($464,200 + $27,700)}{$100,000} \right ) = 69.43%&lt;/math&gt;

The QBI required to achieve this rate is:

:&lt;math&gt;Q = $464,200 + $27,700 = $491,900&lt;/math&gt;

Note that the single and married joint maximum rates are the same, because the married standard deduction, phase-out range, and tax bracket boundary are all double the single values.  If itemized deductions are larger than the standard deduction, the maximum rate will be slightly higher.

The US tax law requires tax to be paid on income at about the same time it is received. Many taxpayers pay income tax by withholding from salary or from other payments. If the withheld tax is not enough, taxpayers must pay a sufficient amount of '''estimated tax''' during the year or pay a penalty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=26 USC 6654: Failure by individual to pay estimated income tax|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/6654)|access-date=September 10, 2025|website=Cornell Legal Information Institue|series=26 USC §6654}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Requirements==
To see if you owe a penalty, complete [https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-2210 IRS Form 2210] (Underpayment of Estimated Tax by Individuals, Estates and Trusts).

*[https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f2210.pdf Form 2210]
*Instructions: [https://www.irs.gov/instructions/i2210 IRS website] or [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i2210.pdf PDF]

===Safe harbors===
There are three “safe harbors” that, if you meet the criteria for any on an annual basis, make it so you owe no underpayment penalty and probably don't need to file Form 2210. These are all covered in Part I of Form 2210.
# The total tax shown on your current year tax return, including self-employment and other taxes, minus any refundable credits, and minus the amount paid through withholding, is less than $1,000.
# You withheld at least 90% of the amount calculated (before subtracting withholding) for harbor #1.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Farmers and fishermen file Form 2210-F, that uses 66-2/3% rather than 90%.&lt;/ref&gt;
# You withheld at least 100% (110% if your adjusted gross income for that year was more than $150,000, or $75,000 if married filing separately) of your "prior year’s tax" (see Form 2210 instructions for what "prior year's tax" includes). 

If you make estimated tax payments instead of or in addition to withholding, and don't meet any of the safe harbors, no penalty is due if you meet safe harbor criteria #2 or #3 for '''''each''''' estimated tax "quarter".
The payment deadlines for these "quarters" are normally April 15, June 15, September 15, and January 15 of the following year.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Farmers and fishermen have only one due date, January 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

The simplest method to test this is Part III of Form 2210, with both tax due and withholding assumed to have been 25% of the total each quarter, and estimated tax payments credited in the quarter paid.  If the previous year's tax overpayment is applied to the current year's estimated tax, it is treated as having been paid on the April 15 deadline unless the overpayment is the result of a tax payment made after that date.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Instructions for Form 2210|url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i2210.pdf|access-date=March 17, 2022|website=Internal Revenue Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;From [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/6654 26 USC § 6654(d)(1)(a)]: ... the amount of any required installment shall be 25 percent of the required annual payment.&lt;/ref&gt;

A slightly more complicated method is to use your actual withholding amount for each quarter.  This can be advantageous if your actual withholding was higher earlier in the year, e.g., if you worked a W-2 job the first half of the year and switched to self-employment for the last half.

The most complicated method is the [[#Annualized income option|annualized income option]] using Schedule AI of Form 2210.  See that section for details.  

While the law specifies a minimum payment to avoid the underpayment penalty, you can always pay more but this means you are giving a no-interest loan to the IRS. There had been an option to use your federal refund to buy [[I_savings_bonds|I Bonds]], but as of January 1, 2025, that option does not exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.treasurydirect.gov/research-center/faq-irs-tax-feature/ |title= Using Your Income Tax Refund to Buy Paper Savings Bonds|author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website= |publisher= Internal Revenue Service |access-date= March 10, 2025 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a separate requirement to file a Form W-4 for salary correctly, claiming the proper amount of withholding to cover the estimated tax due on the salary, and to file an updated Form W-4 when a change in your tax situation would cause the old W-4 to have too little tax withheld. You can also have tax withheld from pension payments by filing Form W-4P and from certain federal payments, e.g., Social Security benefits, by filing Form W-4V.&lt;ref name="Pub 505"&gt;{{Cite web|title=IRS Publication 505, Tax Withholding and Estimated Tax|url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p505.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Annualized income option===
Since the tax due at the end of the year is not known during the year, the IRS provides an option to pay the tax for each period by the 15th day after the end of the period. The periods end on March 31, May 31, August 31, and December 31 and are commonly called "quarters", although only two of the four periods are a quarter of a year, i.e., 3 months long.

To use this method, fill out Schedule AI on IRS form 2210.&lt;ref name="Form 2210"&gt;{{Cite web|title=IRS Form 2210, Underpayment of Estimated Tax by Individuals, Estates, and Trusts|url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f2210.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The form looks at the cumulative periods: January 1 - March 31; January 1 - May 31; January 1 - August 31; and January 1 - December 31. Each cumulative periods share of the tax is computed by annualizing the income; for example, since the first cumulative period is 3 months or 3/12&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; of the year, your income is annualized by multiplying by 12/3 or 4. Similarly, since January 1 - May 31 is 5 months or 5/12 of a year, your income is annualized by multiplying by 12/5 or 2.4. Itemized deductions are annualize the same way, but your full standard deduction is used for each cumulative period if greater than your annualized itemized deductions.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;From [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/6654 26 USC § 6654(d)(2)]: Lower required installment where annualized income installment is less than amount determined under paragraph (1).&lt;/ref&gt;

==How to pay==
If you wish to increase the amount of tax withheld, you can file a new W-4 with your employer or request withholding from withdrawals from tax deferred accounts (e.g., required minimum distributions) as well as from pension payments and social security benefits (as previously mentioned).

(If you are converting a [[Traditional IRA]] to a [[Roth IRA]], you may not want withholding to be taken from that payment, as this will be considered money withdrawn from the traditional IRA and not converted.  Unless you then make up for the withholding with other money, this will reduce the amount added to the Roth IRA, and will subject you to a 10% penalty on the amount not converted if you are under age 59-1/2.)

If you do not pay by withholding, you may fill out [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1040es.pdf IRS Form 1040-ES] to compute the estimated tax you need to pay. You may pay by check with the vouchers on Form 1040-ES, pay electronically at [http://www.eftps.gov/ Electronic Federal Tax Payment System], or use any of the other methods described at [https://www.irs.gov/payments Payments | Internal Revenue Service].

==The penalty ==
If you do not make the estimated tax payments by the due date, the penalty is computed on IRS Form 2210.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The penalty is essentially an interest payment, charged for every day that the payment was late.  Therefore, if you pay a few days late, or underpay by a few dollars, the penalty will be very small.

In most situations, the IRS will compute the penalty; you only need to file the form if you are annualizing income or treating withholding as paid when it was actually withheld, requesting a waiver of the penalty, or you filed a joint tax return for one year but not both.

===Reducing or eliminating the penalty===
If you discover mid-year that you should have been paying estimated tax, you may be able to eliminate the penalty by increasing withholding.  Even if the withholding is done late in the year, the IRS will treat it as meeting the quarterly due dates.  If you cannot increase withholding, paying as soon as possible will reduce the penalty.

If you are required to pay estimated tax because of a mid-year increase in income, you can pay estimated tax for the appropriate quarter and avoid the penalty by filing Schedule AI with Form 2210.

==State taxes==
States have similar requirements for estimated taxes, but the rules vary by state.  Check with each state tax bureau for the safe harbor exemption, due dates, the amount which must be paid for each period, the procedure for paying estimated tax if necessary and the penalty interest rate.  For example, in California,&lt;ref name="CA5805"&gt;{{cite web|title=CA income tax forms; search for Form 5805|url=https://www.ftb.ca.gov/forms/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; 30% of estimated tax must be paid in the first quarter, 40% in the second quarter, and 30% in the fourth quarter, and taxpayers with California adjusted gross income over $1&amp;nbsp;million cannot use 110% of the prior year's tax as a safe harbor. In Maryland,&lt;ref name="MD502UP"&gt;{{cite web|title=MD individual income tax forms; search for Form 502UP|url=https://www.marylandtaxes.gov/individual/income/income-forms-index.php#income}}&lt;/ref&gt; the safe harbor is always 110% of the prior year's tax, and the interest rate on underpayments is much higher.

Estimated tax and withholding penalties also apply to non-resident state income tax.  If you are paying non-resident tax to a state for the first year, your prior year tax will be zero, and thus there will usually be no requirement to pay estimated tax.  However, if you paid non-resident tax in the previous year and have income from that state in the current year, you will probably need to have tax withheld or pay estimated tax.

Many deductions come from your gross salary or wages to determine the amount on your paycheck. '''{{PAGENAME}}''' summarizes the most common of these deductions, and shows which deductions lead to intermediate results such as [[Payroll - cafeteria plan deductions|Social Security and Medicare (FICA)]] wages and [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fw2.pdf IRS Form W-2] Box 1.

References to a [[401(k)]] include [[403(b)]] and [[457(b)]] plans, and the federal [[Thrift Savings Plan]].

==Gross pay==
{{See also|Payroll - cafeteria plan deductions}}

Start with:
# '''Gross Pay''': The total amount of remuneration before removing taxes and other deductions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=What is Gross Pay?|url=https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/careers/compensation/gross-pay/|publisher=Corporate Finance Institute|accessdate=October 1, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|}

See [https://www.irs.gov/publications/p15b#en_US_2021_publink1000193638 Fringe Benefit Exclusion Rules] for other deductions that reduce FICA wages, including
{| class="wikitable"
| - Pretax Commuter costs
|}

==FICA salary/wages==

Subtracting all the above from gross pay gives your
&lt;ol start="2"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;'''[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Insurance_Contributions_Act_tax FICA] salary/wages:''' The amount on which your [[Social Security]] and [[Medicare]] taxes are based. This amount appears in Form W-2 box 5. The amount subject to Social Security taxes, which is the same value except capped at the Social Security Wage Base ($160,200 in 2023), appears in box 3.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

From there, subtract traditional [https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/plan-participant-employee/definitions Elective Deferrals] and any mandatory pre-tax pension contributions
{| class="wikitable"
| - [[401(k)]]
|-
| - Pre-tax pension contribution
|}

==W-2 box 1 amount==

Those subtractions from FICA pay give your
&lt;ol start="3"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;'''W-2 box 1''' amount&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
W-2 box 1 is what goes on the [https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-1040 Form 1040] line for "Wages, salaries, tips, etc."  At the end of the year, the per-paycheck total may be increased by the amount of taxable employer-paid [https://www.irs.gov/government-entities/federal-state-local-governments/group-term-life-insurance Group-Term Life Insurance] and any FICA tax on that amount will be payable with the annual tax return.

You may have elected to make various contributions that do not reduce the W-2 box 1 amount, but do reduce your paycheck amount.  These include
{| class="wikitable"

| - Employee Stock Purchase Plan
|-
| - After-tax 401k
|-
| - After-tax pension contribution
|}

==Net before tax and withholding==
{{See also|Payroll - FICA tax deductions}}

Subtracting those amounts gives your
&lt;ol start="4"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;'''Net before tax and withholding'''&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

The final group of subtractions are the FICA taxes, and withholding amounts based on the [https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-w-4 Form W-4] you have given to your employer.

Withholding for [https://www.irs.gov/publications/p15#en_US_2022_publink1000202352 Supplemental Wages] (bonuses, overtime pay, taxable fringe benefits, and so on) often ignores the W-4 and uses a fixed withholding rate.

==Amount on the paycheck==
Subtracting those amounts gives your
&lt;ol start="5"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;'''Amount on the paycheck'''&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt; that you cash (or receive via direct deposit).  This is often referred to as [https://www.adp.com/resources/articles-and-insights/articles/g/gross-pay-vs-net-pay.aspx net pay or take-home pay].

All the above assumes enough gross pay to cover all deductions, and no interference from government-ordered deductions (for example, garnishment or alimony). When an employee's gross pay is not enough to cover all their deductions, the [https://www.commerce.gov/hr/practitioners/compensation-policies/general-pay/order-of-precedence-from-gross-pay Order of precedence from gross pay] tells employers the order in which to make authorized deductions.

      <text bytes="10942" sha1="otr318vjzkab3woz9g4b0crxeyc8o5h" xml:space="preserve">{{US|reason=irrelevant}}'''{{PAGENAME}}''' discusses several popular tax estimation tools, primarily for use ''during'' the current tax year, to help taxpayers choose the one(s) that will cover their situation best.

No attempt has been made to verify that all calculations in all tools are correct, although these are all popular enough that, at least for the ones with a convenient feedback path, any egregious errors are usually found and fixed quickly.  Some places in which last year's tax law is still used may be noted in the [[#Limitations|Limitations]] section.
==Commercial tax software==
Tax software intended for sale to the consumer (not tax professionals; e.g., the ones reviewed at [https://www.pcmag.com/picks/the-best-tax-software The Best Tax Software | PCMag]) to produce an official tax return is usually not available until November or December of the current tax year (and even then only in partial form). These programs may, however, include  a [https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=3492987#p3492987 "What If...?" worksheet] (or similar name) available to estimate the succeeding tax year's situation.  If such a program produced a correct tax return for the previous tax year, then the "What if...?" feature will likely produce a reasonable estimate for the current tax  year, assuming no significant changes in the taxpayers' situations.

If the tax software does not provide a "What if...?" feature, a simple and effective way to estimate taxes for the following year is to use the current year's return modified with the planned changes. There is no need to purchase new software.

*Make a copy of your current year's return and save it as a new filename.
*Modify tax forms as necessary with the planned changes.
*Adjust withheld taxes to minimize the amount due.
*Create different scenarios by saving the returns with different filenames.

===Example - high medical expenses ===
For example, you unexpectedly move into a skilled nursing facility. Expenses for skilled nursing facilities are qualified medical expenses. Enter the planned expenses on Form 1040 Schedule A. In this situation, your expenses far exceed the 7.5% AGI (Adjusted Gross Income) threshold (for 2021).&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Once you exceed the AGI threshold, you should include ''all'' medical expenses, such as doctor visits and pharmacy prescriptions.&lt;/ref&gt;

You have a choice of taxable investments, savings, and a [[traditional IRA]] to fund these expenses. Since you are over the age of 73, you are already receiving a [[Required Minimum Distribution]] (RMD). The IRA distribution is taxable income reported on IRS Form 1099-R.

What if... you could take those IRA distributions with little or no impact to your taxes?

Modify Form 1099-R Box 1 (Gross distribution) and Box 2a (Taxable amount) with the amount of the planned medical expenses. In this example, the medical expenses exceed the RMD and you are withholding a percentage of taxes based on the withdrawal amount.

The tax software now shows a large refund because the AGI dropped. To avoid a large refund, modify Form 1099-R Box 4 (Federal Income Tax Withheld) and reduce the amount until the refund is close to zero. It is possible that you may not need to have ''any'' taxes withheld, which would make this a tax-free withdrawal.

You can then modify your planned IRA distribution with the new amounts.

==Free tax estimation software==
Some popular free alternatives to the above programs are listed below in alphabetical order across the page.  These programs don't claim to produce an official tax return, but can help with tax planning during the year if they cover a taxpayer's situation. No attempt has been made to rank them, because any overall rank is less important than how they fit an individual's situation.
:blank = not supported by the tool
:X = Separate income line item or calculation fully supported
: 1 = Income lumpable with another entry or credit entry allowed but not calculated
:2 = Tool allows more detail (e.g., full Schedule C) than needed for most tax estimation calculations

{{Notice|This article is a technical analysis of Social Security as an investment in a similar manner to stocks or bonds. New investors do not need to understand this article.}}

The '''[[Social Security]]''' portion of [[Payroll tax|payroll tax]] has a similar character to an investment. Payments are made during working years, in exchange for an income stream once retired, and other benefits. In this page, the behavior of Social Security as an investment is examined.

In the United States, Social Security tax is a component of payroll tax. Taxpayers pay 6.2% Social Security tax on all [[Earned income|earned income]], up to the maximum Social Security Wage Base ($176,100 in 2025). In addition, taxpayers pay 1.45% [[Medicare]] tax on all earned income, with no limit. There is also the Additional Medicare Tax on earned income above $200,000 for single taxpayers or $250,000 for married couples, implemented by the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient_Protection_and_Affordable_Care_Act Affordable Care Act (ACA)]. Employers must deduct these taxes from their employees' payroll, and also must pay an equal amount of the Social Security and Medicare taxes (but not the Additional Medicare Tax) on wages they pay. When the taxpayer acts as their own employer (for example, as a sole proprietor or owner of a corporation), they must pay both halves, with the employer's half being tax-deductible as a business expense. 

Upon reaching retirement age, the taxpayer receives monthly Social Security benefit payments based on the amount of Social Security taxes paid during working years. The investment behavior of Social Security can be examined by analyzing the relationship between the taxes paid and the benefits received. 

==Option to pay payroll tax==

For most taxpayers, there are no legal ways to avoid payroll taxes. Payroll taxes must be paid on all earned income, so this page will have only an academic interest. However, there are two common scenarios when taxpayers have some control over payroll tax:

* Owners of corporations may decide to split their compensation partly as wages and partly as dividends from the business,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.kitces.com/blog/s-corporation-to-reduce-self-employment-taxes-and-social-security-fica/ Kitces - How An S Corporation Can Reduce FICA Self-Employment Taxes]&lt;/ref&gt; reducing payroll taxes because they are not assessed on the dividends. This split is subject to the IRS requirement for "reasonable compensation."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/paying-yourself#7 Small Businesses - Self-employed], IRS&lt;/ref&gt;
* Investors contributing to a [[Health savings account|Health Savings Account (HSA)]] may choose to pay through a [[Payroll deduction|payroll deduction]], avoiding payroll tax, or directly to the HSA custodian. Note: Deducting HSA contributions through an employer vs. directly on a personal tax return can have other tax impacts, such as Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and Expected Family Contributions.

==Rate of return==

The [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_rate_of_return internal rate of return] for Social Security benefits is calculated below for a variety of situations. Social Security benefits are calculated based on the sum of the taxpayer's top 35 years of earnings, adjusted for inflation and capped at the Social Security wage base each year. The sum, divided by 420 (35 years x 12 months) is the taxpayer's Average Indexed Monthly Earnings (AIME). The taxpayer's Primary Insurance Amount (PIA), their monthly retirement benefit when filing at Full Retirement Age (FRA), is calculated based on AIME using a progressive formula. AIME up to the first ''bend point'', $1,226 in 2025, contributes 90% to PIA. AIME from this value up to the second bend point, $7,391 in 2025, contributes 32% to PIA. AIME beyond the second bend point contributes 15% to PIA. The three "brackets" of Social Security benefits are summarized in the following table:

The taxpayer's Social Security bracket is the primary factor affecting the rate of return. Other factors include:

* Gender - Social Security benefits are unisex, but women live longer than men on average, and so expect to receive a larger benefit and therefore higher rate of return. However, gender doesn't affect return when married to an opposite-sex spouse, because the surviving spouse will inherit the larger payment.
* Health - Likewise, individual taxpayers with longer life expectancy based on their health can expect a higher rate of return.
* Income taxes - Half of payroll taxes are income tax-deductible, and future benefits may be taxable, so current and future tax rates affect rate of return.
* Whether a spouse will be receiving benefits based on the taxpayer's earnings record. If so, the rate of return will be higher.
* Whether one or both halves of payroll tax are paid by the taxpayer. The rate of return for paying only one half is higher. However, in practice, this is usually bad for a taxpayer making a decision whether to payroll tax-deduct HSA contributions, because the future benefit is being foregone for only half of the tax savings today.
* Time - Payroll tax payments when older have the benefits return sooner, and so tend to have a higher ''magnitude'' of rate of return (that is, positive rates of return will be higher, negative rates will be more negative). In addition, a person's life expectancy naturally increases as they get older, because they have survived more potential causes of death. This effect improves the rate of return for older taxpayers, and can turn negative rates of return positive.

Figures 1 to 4 show charts for four potential combinations of cases, of taxpayers paying either the employee half or both halves of payroll tax, and with or without the spouse receiving a 50% benefit.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title=SS_ROIv2.xlsm|url=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1W_UBn1WUF2sLB6iQRCnwF26tlfrC1Jxl/edit?usp=sharing&amp;ouid=106746680505337239741&amp;rtpof=true&amp;sd=true|access-date=Nov 4, 2022|website=Google Docs}} Spreadsheet used to create the plots and tables. &lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Assumptions for these charts:
* Both Social Security and Medicare taxes are included, because both have to be paid to get an AIME credit (but the Additional Medicare Tax is excluded)
* Income tax rates at tax payment are 10%, 12%, and 24% respectively for 90%, 32%, and 15% brackets
* Full Retirement Age (FRA) is 67 for both the taxpayer and spouse
* Taxpayer and spouse are the same age, opposite-sex, and file for benefits at FRA, receiving 100% and 50% respectively of the taxpayer's PIA. Note: the "no spouse" cases also apply to married taxpayers whose spouses will collect benefits based on their own earnings records.
* Retirement benefits are untaxed for 90% and 32% brackets, but are taxed at the maximum 85% rate in the 24% income tax bracket (for a [[Marginal tax rate|marginal tax rate]] of 20.4%) for the 15% bracket
* Life expectancy is per the 2022 Social Security Administration actuarial life table,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ssa.gov/oact/STATS/table4c6.html Actuarial Life Table], Social Security Administration (SSA)&lt;/ref&gt; which is an average life expectancy for all Americans
* Only retirement benefits are considered, not disability or survivor benefits

==Payback rate==

The ''payback rate'' is an alternative measure of the performance, defined as the ratio of the [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/npv.asp Net Present Value (NPV)] of future payments to the payroll tax cost today. It gives an idea of whether the tax payments have more of a character of an investment (payback rate of ~100% or greater) or an ordinary tax (payback rate close to 0). The payback rate is calculated for two [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/discountrate.asp discount rates].

In all cases, the payback rate increases with the age of the taxpayer, because life expectancy increases with age, and also because of the time value of money (for cases where the discount rate is greater than 0).

==Situations when payroll tax provides no return on investment==

In the following situations, paying additional Social Security tax provides no direct benefit to the taxpayer, and the payments can be considered an ordinary tax, to be avoided where possible:

* The taxpayer will not accumulate 40 work credits (equivalent to 10 years of earnings) necessary to qualify for Social Security retirement benefits
* The taxpayer has worked (or will work) more than 35 years, and the current year will not be one of the highest 35 years of earnings (indexed for inflation)
* The taxpayer's personal Social Security benefit will be smaller than 50% of their spouse's benefit (except for a small potential benefit if filing before their spouse)

In addition, all payroll tax payments above the Social Security wage base, comprised of only Medicare taxes, also provide no direct benefit to the taxpayer.

==Comparison to traditional investments==

Social Security is most closely analogous to a [[Variable annuity|deferred annuity]]. Compared to traditional investments, Social Security has some important advantages and disadvantages. Separate from the rate of return, advantages include:

* Tax payments represent "forced saving" of enough of your income to provide a basic standard of living once you cannot or do not want to continue to work, regardless of diligence with [[Household budgeting|budgeting]]
* Benefits have no risks of investment loss or underperformance
* Benefits grow tax-deferred
* Benefits are automatically indexed to inflation
* Benefits are automatically annuitized, protecting recipients from spending at [[Safe withdrawal rates|too high a rate]], and (to some degree) from other poor financial decisions
* Benefits are [[Asset protection|asset-protected]] from most creditors&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.elderlawanswers.com/can-social-security-benefits-be-garnished-to-pay-debts--15460 Can Social Security Benefits Be Garnished to Pay Debts?], ElderLawAnswers&lt;/ref&gt;
* Benefits are tax-advantaged - tax-free to many retirees, only up to 85% of benefits are taxable federally, and [[Taxation_of_Social_Security_benefits#State_taxation|most states do not tax]] benefits
* Benefits have an insurance value, in that they continue as long as the recipient is alive. This provides utility beyond the expected rate of return, in that it provides additional funding for a long retirement that stretches other savings. A taxpayer can buy a [[Immediate fixed annuity|SPIA]] when they retire, but SPIAs tend to have lower rates of return than Social Security, and importantly are not indexed to inflation, so are not nearly as good insurance against high longevity.

Disadvantages include:

* Taxpayer has no direct influence over the growth of value, as with a traditional portfolio
* Benefits are illiquid and can't be accessed before filing, or in lump-sum form (without separately taking out a loan and using the benefits to make payments)
* Benefits are lost at death and can't be passed to heirs, except for spousal benefits which continue until the spouse's death, and survivor benefits for taxpayers who die before retirement age

The risks of Social Security are different than traditional investments. Compared to [[Bond basics|bonds]], there is no interest rate risk, and the credit risk is very low, comparable to other government-backed investments like [[Treasury bond|treasury bonds]] or [[TIPS]]. Compared to [[Stock basics|stocks]], there is no price volatility, nor business or market risk. However, there is a significant legislative risk that the program could be changed in the decades between when a taxpayer pays payroll tax and is scheduled to receive benefits. This risk reduces dramatically, although is not completely eliminated, once a taxpayer files for and begins to receive benefits.

==Recommendations==

Taxpayers who expect to be in the 90% bracket at retirement should not avoid payroll tax, which is probably one of the best investment that can be made. 

Taxpayers who expect to be in the 32% bracket at retirement can expect a modest return. HSA contributions should be made directly to the custodian so as not to avoid the employee half of payroll tax, except for young males and/or taxpayers who would otherwise be able to invest the taxes in a retirement account such as an [[IRA]] or [[401k]]. However, older (age 55+) taxpayers in this bracket should not avoid payroll tax in any case.

Taxpayers who expect to be in the 15% bracket at retirement should expect zero or negative real returns from payroll taxes, and should avoid paying them where possible.

'''Taxable equivalent yield''' (TEY) is a method to compare the after-tax return of fixed-income investments that have different rates of taxation.

When buying fixed-income securities ([[Treasury bond]]s, in-state and out-of-state [[municipal bonds]], [[corporate bonds]], [[certificate of deposit]]s (CD), etc) or bond or [[money market]] funds in taxable accounts, you want to compare yields on an taxable-equivalent basis, since each of these may be taxed differently. What matters is the yield you have left to spend after you pay income taxes. Of course inflation is a factor too, but this article discusses only tax equivalence.

You can compare either after tax yield (ATY), or equivalent before tax yield, which is called taxable equivalent yield (TEY). The convention seems to be to do the latter, probably because most quoted yields are taxable yields.

==Examples and usage==
For example, sometimes short-term Treasury bonds have lower rates than High Yield Savings Accounts (HYSAs) but are not subject to state and local income tax. So, if you pay state income tax, the TEY of a short-term Treasury could be higher than the TEY of the HYSA, even though the HYSA interest rate is higher than the Treasury yield. To compare a product with a lower interest rate but subject to lower tax to a product that has a higher interest rate but higher taxes, you can calculate a TEY.

A second example. Suppose that your [[marginal tax rate]] is 25% with no state tax, a corporate bond yields 4%, and a municipal bond yields 3%.  The ATY of the corporate bond is 3%, equal to the tax-free yield of the municipal bond.  Alternatively, you could say that the municipal bond has a 4% TEY, since it has the same after-tax yield as a taxable bond yielding 4%.  Both numbers tell you that the two bonds have the same effective yield for you.

Calculate using either a [[Tools_and_calculators#Taxable equivalent yields|calculator]] or the following formulas.&lt;ref&gt;{{forum post|t=248539|title=Taxable Equivalent Yield (TEY)}}, Retrieved 2023-02-02&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thefinancebuff.com/files/calculators/Bond-Funds-Yield-Calculator.html|title=Bond Fund Yield Calculator|publisher=The Finance Buff|accessdate=2023-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; For derivations of these formulas, see: [[Taxable equivalent yield (math)]].

==Definitions==
* &lt;math&gt;ATY&lt;/math&gt; - After Tax Yield.
* &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; - Total federal marginal tax rate, include NIIT, AMT, and any other items that affect your [[Marginal tax rate|marginal tax rate]]. Your marginal tax rate is not necessarily the same as your top tax bracket.
* &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; - Total state marginal tax rate: include state AMT and any other items that affect your actual marginal tax rate.
* &lt;math&gt;TEY&lt;/math&gt; - Taxable Equivalent Yield
* &lt;math&gt;tt&lt;/math&gt; - Total marginal income tax rate applicable to fully taxable fixed income (including federal tax, state tax, NIIT, AMT, etc.).
* &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; - Yield.

All TEY formulas start with the form: &lt;math&gt;TEY = \frac{ATY}{1-tt}&lt;/math&gt;

==Municipal bonds==
{{See also|Municipal bonds}}

===In-state municipal bond===

If not itemizing deductions:
:&lt;math&gt;TEY = \frac{Y}{1-tt}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;ATY = Y&lt;/math&gt;

If itemizing deductions, and you can fully deduct state income tax:
:&lt;math&gt;TEY = \frac{Y}{(1-f)\times (1-s)}&lt;/math&gt;

===Out-of-state municipal bond===

If not itemizing deductions:
:&lt;math&gt;TEY = \frac{Y \times (1-s)}{1-tt}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;ATY = Y \times (1-s)&lt;/math&gt;

If itemizing deductions, and you can fully deduct state income tax:
:&lt;math&gt;TEY = \frac{Y}{1-f}&lt;/math&gt;

==US Treasury bonds==
{{See also|Treasury bond}}

If not itemizing deductions:
:&lt;math&gt;TEY = \frac{Y \times (1-f)}{1-tt}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;ATY = Y \times (1-f)&lt;/math&gt;

If itemizing deductions, and you can fully deduct state income tax:
:&lt;math&gt;TEY = \frac{Y}{1-s}&lt;/math&gt;

==Taxable bonds or high yield savings account==
No TEY formula is required for fully taxable fixed income (e.g., HYSA, fully-taxable money market fund), since the TEY is just the stated yield.
:&lt;math&gt;TEY = Y&lt;/math&gt; (for fully taxable fixed income)

==Top tax bracket vs total marginal tax rate==
Your top tax bracket is not necessarily the same as your total marginal tax rate when using these formulas. For more, see: [[Marginal tax rate|marginal tax rate]]. In brief, you may need to factor in some of the following to determine your total marginal tax rate:

* Itemized deductions
* [https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc560 Additional Medicare Tax]
* [[ACA net investment income tax]]
* [https://taxfoundation.org/state-individual-alternative-minimum-tax-2019/ State Alternative Minimum Tax]
* [https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc556 Federal Alternative Minimum Tax]

==General rules==
* Higher income tax brackets obtain more benefit from tax-advantaged products. While tax-advantaged fixed income products and municipal bonds may advertise TEY, the AFTER tax yield is most important as each individual's marginal tax rate is different.
* Computing the TEY becomes more complex if you are near the top of a tax bracket and any additional income would be split across two or more tax brackets. This is where "what if" financial spreadsheet modeling for households can be really valuable for evaluating potential investments.
* US Treasury bonds are exempt from state and local income taxes but subject to federal income taxes. 
* In-state municipal bonds are exempt from federal, state, or local income taxes. 
* Out-of-state municipal bonds are exempt from federal income tax but subject to state and local income taxes. 
* Taxable bonds or high yield savings account are subject to federal, state, and local income taxes.

The [[wikipedia:Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017|Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017]] capped the state and local tax (SALT) deduction at $10,000 and raised the standard deduction to $12,000 for single filers and $24,000 for married couples filing jointly for tax years 2018-2025.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://money.usnews.com/money/personal-finance/taxes/articles/state-and-local-taxes-what-is-the-salt-deduction| title=State and Local Taxes: What Is the SALT Deduction?| publisher=U.S. News &amp; World Report| date=2022-12-02| accessdate=2023-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most people will not derive any income tax benefit with respect to investment income by itemizing deductions, and the derivations in this section are based on this assumption.

We start by considering fully taxable income, for which
:&lt;math&gt;ATY = Y \times (1-tt) \implies Y = \frac{ATY}{1-tt}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is the yield and &lt;math&gt;tt&lt;/math&gt; is the total marginal income tax rate. 

For fully taxable income, &lt;math&gt;TEY = Y&lt;/math&gt;, and we can rewrite the equation as:
:&lt;math&gt;TEY = \frac{ATY}{1-tt}&lt;/math&gt;

This equation only applies to fully taxable income (for bank accounts, using annual percentage yield (APY) for &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; gives results that generally are close enough for comparisons). 

For example, for marginal income tax rates of 22% federal and 9.3% state, with no NIIT, AMT or other credit phase-ins or phase-outs,
:&lt;math&gt;tt = f + s&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;tt = 22% + 9.3% = 31.3%&lt;/math&gt;

These marginal tax rates are not the same as the top tax brackets; they include anything that affects the true marginal tax rate; e.g., [[ACA net investment income tax]] (NIIT) and [https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc556 Federal Alternative Minimum Tax] (AMT), and local income tax. For example, for marginal income tax rates of 35% federal, 3.8% NIIT, and 5% state,
:&lt;math&gt;tt = (35% + 3.8% + 5%) = 43.8%&lt;/math&gt;

Next, we determine &lt;math&gt;ATY&lt;/math&gt; for different types of income, and use that to compute the TEY for those incomes.

===In-state municipal bond===
In-state municipal bond income is exempt from both federal and state tax.

First we solve for the ATY of an in-state municipal bond. (Note: the after-tax yield is simply the yield in this situation.)
:&lt;math&gt;ATY = Y \times (1-tt)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;ATY = Y&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is the yield of an in-state municipal bond. Then we calculate the TEY for an in-state municipal bond:
:&lt;math&gt;TEY = \frac{ATY}{1-tt}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;TEY = \frac{Y}{1-tt}&lt;/math&gt;

Note that &lt;math&gt;tt&lt;/math&gt; is the same in all the TEY equations, so we would use the same &lt;math&gt;tt&lt;/math&gt; as in the previous examples; e.g., 31.3% or 43.8%.

===Out-of-state municipal bond===
Out of state municipal bond income is exempt from federal income tax but not state income tax. 

First we solve for the ATY of a out-of-state municipal bond:
:&lt;math&gt;ATY = Y \times (1-tt)&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;tt = s&lt;/math&gt;
:::&lt;math&gt;ATY = Y \times (1-s)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is the yield of an out-of-state municipal bond. Then we calculate the TEY for an out-of-state municipal bond:
:&lt;math&gt;TEY = \frac{ATY}{1-tt}&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;ATY = Y \times (1-s)&lt;/math&gt;
:::&lt;math&gt;TEY = \frac{Y \times (1-s)}{1-tt}&lt;/math&gt;

===Treasuries===
Treasury bond income is exempt from state and local income tax but not federal income tax.

First we solve for the ATY of a Treasury bond:
:&lt;math&gt;ATY = Y \times (1-tt)&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;tt = f&lt;/math&gt;
:::&lt;math&gt;ATY = Y \times (1-f)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is the yield of a Treasury bond. Then we calculate the TEY for a Treasury bond:
:&lt;math&gt;TEY = \frac{ATY}{1-tt}&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;ATY = Y \times (1-f)&lt;/math&gt;
:::&lt;math&gt;TEY = \frac{Y \times (1-f)}{1-tt}&lt;/math&gt;

== When itemizing deductions ==

If you itemize deductions and can fully deduct state income tax on Schedule A, the equations are slightly different. Historically, these are the formulas seen most often in TEY calculations. Thus the slightly more complicated equations in the above section are more likely to be applicable.

The after-tax value of a fully taxable security as derived above:
:&lt;math&gt;TEY = \frac{ATY}{1-tt} \implies ATY = TEY \times (1-tt)&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;tt = f + s - f \times s&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;f \times s&lt;/math&gt; is deducting state income tax from your federal tax
:::&lt;math&gt;ATY = TEY \times (1-(f + s - f \times s))&lt;/math&gt; 
::::&lt;math&gt;ATY = TEY \times (1-f-s+f \times s)&lt;/math&gt;
::::&lt;math&gt;\implies ATY = TEY \times [(1-f) \times (1-s)]&lt;/math&gt;
::::&lt;math&gt;\implies TEY = \frac{ATY}{(1-f)\times (1-s)}&lt;/math&gt;

===In-state municipal bond===
In-state municipal bond income is exempt from both federal and state tax.

First we solve for the ATY of an in-state municipal bond. (Note: the after-tax yield is simply the yield in this situation.)
:&lt;math&gt;ATY = Y \times (1-tt)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;ATY = Y&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is the yield of an in-state municipal bond. Then we calculate the TEY for an in-state municipal bond using the derived formula above:
:&lt;math&gt;TEY = \frac{ATY}{(1-f)\times (1-s)}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;TEY = \frac{Y}{(1-f)\times (1-s)}&lt;/math&gt;

===Out-of-state municipal bond===
Out of state municipal bond income is exempt from federal income tax but not state income tax. 

First we solve for the ATY of a out-of-state municipal bond:
:&lt;math&gt;ATY = Y \times (1-tt)&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;tt = s&lt;/math&gt;
:::&lt;math&gt;ATY = Y \times (1-s)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is the yield of an out-of-state municipal bond. Then we calculate the TEY for an out-of-state municipal bond:
:&lt;math&gt;TEY = \frac{ATY}{(1-f)\times (1-s)}&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;ATY = Y \times (1-s)&lt;/math&gt;
:::&lt;math&gt;TEY = \frac{Y \times (1 - s)}{(1-f) \times (1-s)}&lt;/math&gt;
::::&lt;math&gt;TEY = \frac{Y}{1-f}&lt;/math&gt;

===Treasuries===
Treasury bond income is exempt from state and local income tax but not federal income tax.

First we solve for the ATY of a Treasury bond:
:&lt;math&gt;ATY = Y \times (1-tt)&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;tt = f&lt;/math&gt;
:::&lt;math&gt;ATY = Y \times (1-f)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is the yield of a Treasury. Then we calculate the TEY for a Treasury:
:&lt;math&gt;TEY = \frac{ATY}{(1-f)\times (1-s)}&lt;/math&gt;
:::&lt;math&gt;ATY = Y \times (1-f)&lt;/math&gt;
::::&lt;math&gt;TEY = \frac{Y \times (1 - f)}{(1-f) \times (1-s)}&lt;/math&gt;
:::::&lt;math&gt;TEY = \frac{Y}{1-s}&lt;/math&gt;

== For funds partially exempt from state income tax ==

Some funds are partially exempt from state tax. For the tax year 2018, Vanguard Federal Money Market Fund (VMFXX) had about 78% of income exempt from state income. 
(U.S. government obligations information: Important tax information for 2018).  Since the Federal Money Market fund is the settlement fund in a Vanguard Brokerage account, this is a fund that many people might want to be able to compare to other funds on a taxable-equivalent basis.

Notably, California, Connecticut, and New York require that 50% of the fund’s assets at each quarter-end within the tax year consist of U.S. government obligations (USGO) for a state tax exemption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.vanguard.com/pdf/USGOIN_2023.pdf| title=U.S. government obligations income information| publisher=Vanguard| date=2022| accessdate=2023-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in 2018, residents of all states except California, Connecticut, and New York would get a partial state tax exemption on a Prime Money Market fund holding, which had about 28% of income from USGO in 2018, and about 37% of assets in USGO on Dec 31, 2018.

For 2022, however, unlike 2018, VMFXX did not meet the 50% requirement for California, Connecticut, and New York, so fund holders in these states receive no state tax exemption. This highlights the risk in assuming the state tax exemption percentage for the current year.

From here, the formulas assume no federal deduction for state income tax on marginal income, which is the most common case, either because of the high standard deduction or hitting the $10,000 deduction limit for SALT.

For such a fund, the state tax rate on partially state exempt income is &lt;math&gt;s \times (1 - se)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; is the marginal state tax rate and &lt;math&gt;se&lt;/math&gt; is the state-tax-exempt portion of fund income. For example, for 2018, &lt;math&gt;se&lt;/math&gt; was about 78% for the Federal Money Market fund, so &lt;math&gt;1-se = 1 - 0.78 = 0.22&lt;/math&gt;; i.e., your state would tax about 22% of your Federal Money Market fund income. We do not know what &lt;math&gt;se&lt;/math&gt; will be for 2019, so we assume it will be the same as for 2018 in estimating TEY for 2019.

So the after-tax yield (ATY) factor for income that is partially exempt from state tax is:
:&lt;math&gt;ATY factor = (1 - f - s \times (1-se))&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; = marginal federal tax rate, &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; = marginal state tax rate, and &lt;math&gt;se&lt;/math&gt; = state-exempt percentage of income.

This can also be written as:
:&lt;math&gt;ATY factor = (1 - f - s + s \times se)&lt;/math&gt;

You multiply the partially-state-tax-exempt fund yield (&lt;math&gt;Ypse&lt;/math&gt;) by the ATY factor to get the after tax yield:
:&lt;math&gt;ATY = Ypse \times (1 - f - s \times (1-se))&lt;/math&gt;

As derived in the original post, the &lt;math&gt;TEY factor&lt;/math&gt; is just the &lt;math&gt;ATY factor&lt;/math&gt; divided by &lt;math&gt;(1 - f - s)&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;TEY factor = \frac{(1 - f - s \times (1-se))}{(1 - f - s)}&lt;/math&gt;

And &lt;math&gt;TEY&lt;/math&gt; is:
:&lt;math&gt;TEY = Ypse \times TEY factor = Ypse \times \frac{(1 - f - s \times (1-se))}{(1 - f - s)}&lt;/math&gt;

===Example calculation===

Using &lt;math&gt;se = 0.78&lt;/math&gt; for the Federal Money Market fund, current compound yield of 1.87%, and estimated marginal tax rates of 27% Federal and 8% state,
:&lt;math&gt;ATY factor = (1 - f - s \times (1-se)) = (1 - 0.27 - 0.08 \times (1 - 0.78)) = 0.7124&lt;/math&gt;

The estimated compound after-tax yield on Federal Money Market fund is &lt;math&gt;1.87% \times 0.7124 = 1.33%&lt;/math&gt;.

And:
:&lt;math&gt;TEY factor = \frac{ATY factor}{(1 - f - s)} = \frac{(1 - f - s \times (1-se))}{(1 - f - s)} = \frac{0.7124}{(1 - 0.27 - 0.08)} = 1.096&lt;/math&gt;

The estimated compound TEY for the Federal Money Market fund is &lt;math&gt;1.87% \times 1.096 = 2.05%&lt;/math&gt;.

This page attempts to list all known UK-reporting US ETFs which are not on the [[US_domiciled_ETFs_that_are_UK_HMRC_reporting_funds|main list]] of such ETFs on the Bogleheads Wiki.

== Introduction ==

As with ETFs in general, not all UK-reporting US ETFs on the market will be of interest to those who follow a Boglehead-style [[Bogleheads® investment philosophy|investment philosophy]] centered on a simple portfolio of broad-based, low-cost, passive index funds.

In light of this - and to reduce clutter - ETFs of the following types have been excluded from the main list:

* Sector ETFs, focusing on individual industries (exception: real estate/REIT funds)
* Geographic ETFs, narrowly focusing on countries/regions (exceptions: Europe/Asia developed markets, and UK-specific or US-specific funds)
* Active ETFs (exceptions: [https://www.dimensional.com/us-en/individual Dimensional] or [https://www.avantisinvestors.com/ Avantis] funds, which have large fanbases on the Bogleheads forums)
* "[https://www.forbes.com/2009/12/14/active-managers-index-funds-etfs-personal-finance-richard-ferri.html Spindex]" funds - where a fund tracks an "index" controlled by or constructed to the requirements of the ETF provider, to provide a veneer for marketing and legal purposes of passive "index investing" over a traditional active strategy
* Leveraged or inverse ETFs
* Alternative assets (for example, carbon credits, cryptocurrency, commodities with the exception of gold)
* Alternative strategies (for example, long/short funds, options strategies including buy/write)

== The funds ==

The table shows data from HMRC's [https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/offshore-funds-list-of-reporting-funds approved offshore reporting funds] list, as of 10 November 2025. This list shows funds by [[wikipedia:CUSIP|CUSIP]]. The mapping from CUSIP to fund exchange ticker uses data from [https://www.openfigi.com/ OpenFIGI], as of 10 November 2025.

      <text bytes="2949" sha1="ecx22pq30fm1nj4wxjh4wlqpndrlctw" xml:space="preserve">Known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), [https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/1 H.R.1 - 119th Congress (2025-2026)] modifies US taxation and became law on July 4, 2025. '''{{PAGENAME}}''' provides an overview of changes made in this Act.

It can be challenging to understand how these changes will affect you. Instead of waiting for tax software to be released at the end of the year, tax estimation tools can help you prepare for these changes during the ''current'' year.

A list of the [[Tax estimation tools#Latest tax year available |latest tax year available]] identifies which tools have been updated to incorporate the July 4, 2025 changes (at least to the extent the IRS is expected to implement them).
