      <text bytes="15702" sha1="eal0j4p676dyy808ybwb3znzx6s532l" xml:space="preserve">'''{{PAGENAME}}''', also known as "survivor bias", is the tendency for [[mutual fund]]s or [[hedge funds]] that have produced poor performance or low asset accumulations to be either liquidated or merged out of existence. In the case of long term global asset returns, survivorship bias can mean the loss of whole markets due to war or revolution. The result is an overestimation of past returns, as these poor returning funds or national markets disappear from historical data.

==Mutual fund survivorship bias==
===''Survivorship Bias and Mutual Fund Performance'' study===
This study by [[Edwin J. Elton]], [[Martin J. Gruber]], and [[Christopher R. Blake]] of survivorship bias in U.S. mutual funds examines the period between 1976-1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author1=Edwin J. Elton| author1-link=Edwin J. Elton| author2=Martin J. Gruber| author2-link=Martin J. Gruber| author3=Christopher R. Blake| author3-link=Christopher R. Blake| title=Survivorship Bias and Mutual Fund Performance| date=March 1995| publisher=NYU Working Paper No. FIN-94-027| url=http://ssrn.com/abstract=1299448}} Available at SSRN.&lt;/ref&gt; The paper has a section devoted to a review of prior studies (along with their methodology problems).

In one prior study, [[Stephen J. Brown]] and [[William N. Goetzmann]] examined raw returns fund data from 1976-1988, and found overestimation bias of 0.20% and 0.80%, depending on the weighting scheme.&lt;ref&gt;[[William N. Goetzmann]], ''Attrition and Mutual Fund Performance'' (with S.J. Brown), Journal of Finance, Vol. 49, No. 3, 1055-1056, 1994. The paper is not available on-line.&lt;/ref&gt; In another, [[Burton G. Malkiel]] found overestimation bias of 1.5% using unadjusted raw data.&lt;ref&gt;[[Burton G. Malkiel]], ''Returns from Investing in Equity Mutual Funds 1971-1991''. JOURNAL OF FINANCE, Vol 50 No 2, June 1995. The paper is not available online.&lt;/ref&gt;

The study authors found that modelers tried to determine bias measure performance either by considering the common stock investing policy at the beginning of the period, or by considering the common stock investing policy throughout the period. They report both approaches. The authors prefer a risk-adjusted three index method (passive benchmarks for large cap stocks, small cap stocks, bonds and bills) over all other measuring methods, such as single index ([[S&amp;P 500 index]]), or raw returns.

The following table, reproduced from the paper, shows survivorship bias results according to various methodologies for the 1976-1993 period. Panel A looks at results assuming investment ends at the point the fund disappears from the data record via merger or policy change. Panel B shows a "follow the money" method, assuming the investment continues to be held in the new merged fund after the disappearing fund has been merged. The authors also mention their 1993 paper&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher R. Blake]], [[Edwin J. Elton]], and [[Martin J. Gruber]], ''The Performance of Bond Mutual Funds'', The Journal of Business Vol. 66, No. 3 (Jul., 1993), pp. 371-403. The paper is not available online.&lt;/ref&gt; on survivorship bias in bond funds. Using similar risk-adjusted three index factor methodology the authors report 0.27% of overestimated return due to survivorship bias.

Additional findings from the authors:
* Disappearing funds are mostly small funds.
* The funds into which the disappearing funds are merged tend to have higher [[expense ratios]]. The expense ratio tends not to decline after the merger.
* The funds into which the disappearing funds are merged tend to have better past performance records. Performance tends to drop after the merger.

===''Mutual Fund Survivorship'' study===
Mark M. Carhart, Jennifer N. Carpenter, Anthony W. Lynch, and David K. Musto provide a comprehensive study of mutual fund survivorship issues using a mutual fund data set (Carhart 1997) and using a four-factor analysis of fund returns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author1=Mark M. Carhart| author2=Jennifer N. Carpenter| author3=Anthony W. Lynch| author4=David K. Musto| title=Mutual Fund Survivorship| date=September 12, 2000| url=http://ssrn.com/abstract=238713| doi=10.2139/ssrn.238713}} Available at SSRN.&lt;/ref&gt; The authors found that in the sample, funds disappear primarily because of multi-year poor performance. They found that survivor bias in average performance tends to increase with the length of the sample period (although they caution that it is possible to construct counterexamples). In the sample, they found survivor bias of 0.17% per year for one year samples, increasing to larger than one percent per year for samples longer than fifteen years.

===Morningstar mutual funds===
A Savant Capital Management Zero Alpha Group study examining Morningstar mutual fund returns data for the period 1995-2004 found that dropping defunct funds from the Morningstar database boosted reported returns on average by 1.3% per year over the ten year period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.savantcapital.com/uploadedFiles/Savant_CMS_Website/Press_Coverage/Press_Releases/Older_releases/sbiasstudy%5B1%5D.pdf| title=Study: Hidden Bias in Morningstar Data 'Systematically and Significantly' Overstates Managed Mutual Fund Performance| publisher=Savant}}{{dead link}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study applied returns to the closest fitting index to each asset class. For U.S equity returns the benchmark indexes were S&amp;P indexes. For developed market international stocks the market benchmarks were MSCI indexes. Emerging markets stocks were benchmarked to the S&amp;P/IFCI Emerging Markets index. The following table shows the study findings of survivorship bias in the Morningstar data, indicating the annualized return adjustment needed to provide bias-free returns.

==Hedge fund survivorship bias==
[[Harry M. Kat]] and Amin S. Guarov report the following conclusions regarding hedge fund attrition and survivorship bias for the period 1994-2001 using data from the Tremont Tass database of hedge fund returns, which start in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author1=Harry M. Kat| author1-link=Harry M. Kat| author2=Guarav S. Amin| title=Welcome to the Dark Side: Hedge Fund Attrition and Survivorship Bias over the Period 1994-2001| date=December 11, 2001| publisher=Cass Business School Research Paper| url=http://ssrn.com/abstract=293828| doi=10.2139/ssrn.293828}} Available at SSRN.&lt;/ref&gt; This period includes major market events such as the Long Term Management collapse, the Russian default, and the early 2000-2001 stock market drop.
*'''Attrition''': Hedge funds exhibit a high level of attrition; and the attrition grows over time. Hedge fund fund of funds exhibit lower levels of attrition, but they too show growing rates of attrition over time.
*'''Factors behind attrition''': The main factors behind hedge fund attrition are lack of size and lack of performance. There are no identifiable causes for the increasing attrition over time. The authors suggest that an increasingly aggressive attitude among both old and new hedge fund managers alike might be the cause.
*'''Survivorship bias over mean returns''': Concentrating on survivors will overestimate returns by approximately 2.0% per year. However small and leveraged funds have bias between 4%-5% per year. Fund of funds bias is lower, 0.63% per year.
*'''Survivorship bias in higher moments''': Ignoring dead funds can result in underestimating hedge fund standard deviation and kurtosis, while overestimating skewness and inflating the mean. Without adjusting for survivorship bias, investors are thus likely to substantially overestimate the benefits of hedge funds. 

[[Roger G. Ibbotson]] and Peng Chen examine hedge fund returns data (using the Tremont Tass database) for the period 1995 -2006 which reports an equal weighted net of fees hedge fund return of 16.45%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author1=Roger G. Ibbotson| author1-link=Roger G. Ibbotson| author2=Peng Chen| title=The A,B,Cs of Hedge Funds: Alphas, Betas, and Costs| date=September 2006| publisher=Yale ICF Working Paper No. 06-10| url=http://ssrn.com/abstract=733264}} Available at SSRN.&lt;/ref&gt; The authors find a survivorship bias of 2.74% per year over the period. Including "backfill bias"{{#tag:ref|"Backfill bias" is also known as "instant history bias". Investopedia defines it as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/instant-history-bias.asp| title=Instant History Bias: What it Means, How it Works, Example| publisher=Investopedia| accessdate=January 4, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{blockquote|Instant history bias, also known as "backfill bias," is a phenomenon whereby inconsistent reporting practices can unduly inflate the apparent performance of a hedge fund.&lt;br&gt;

This inaccuracy stems from the fact that hedge fund managers can elect whether and when to report their results to the public. Because of this, managers often delay reporting their performance until they generate a track record of positive results. In doing so, they effectively hide the years in which they performed poorly.}}
|group="note"}}&lt;ref group="note"&gt;For a study on hedge fund backfill bias, see also: {{cite web| author1=Nolke Posthuma| author2=Pieter Jelle Van der Sluis| title=A Reality Check on Hedge Funds Returns| date=July 8, 2003| url=http://ssrn.com/abstract=438840| doi=10.2139/ssrn.438840}} Available at SSRN.&lt;/ref&gt; the overstatement of returns increases to 5.68% per year.

Xiaoqing Eleanor Xu, Jiong Liu, and Anthony Loviscek reviewed hedge fund results from the CISDM (Center for International Securities &amp; Derivative Markets) database from January of 1994 to March of 2009, a period which includes the 2008 financial crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author1=Xiaoqing Eleanor| author2=Jiong Liu| author3=Anthony Loviscek| title=Hedge Fund Attrition, Survivorship Bias, and Performance: Perspectives from the Global Financial Crisis| date=February 12, 2010| url=http://ssrn.com/abstract=1572116}} Available at SSRN.&lt;/ref&gt; The authors found a large increase in hedge fund attrition, rising to 31% in 2009. For the 2008-2009 financial crisis period, the authors found survivorship bias to be somewhat lower than historical experience, measuring between 1.32% and 1.68%. However, the authors contend that the lack of reporting data for the last few months of a dissolving fund's existence understates the bias. They estimate actual bias between 1.68% and 6.48% for the crisis period. They report fund of funds survivorship bias of 3.8% for the crisis period.

==Current reporting of fund attrition and survivorship bias==
S&amp;P reports current mutual fund attrition rates in both their regular series of [[SPIVA scorecards | S&amp;P Index vs. Active (SPIVA)]] reports and in their periodic reports on fund performance persistence. The reports provide attrition over three year and five year periods. SPIVA also uses the CRSP (The Center for Research in Security Prices) Survivor-Basis Free Mutual Fund Database as the basis for comparing fund returns to index returns.

The CRSP Mutual Fund Database was developed in three stages. The database, with data beginning December 1961 through December 1995, was developed by Mark M. Carhart for his 1995 dissertation, ''Survivor Bias and Persistence in Mutual Fund Performance''. Funding for this project was provided by [[Eugene F. Fama]] and the Center for Research in Security Prices. The Center for Research in Security Prices continued Mark Carhart's work after his graduation. Historical data in the database were collected and verified from numerous printed sources. Beginning in December 2007, current and historical data back to August 1998 are provided electronically by Lipper and Thomson Reuters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.crsp.com/documentation/pdfs/MFDB_Guide.pdf| title=The CRSP Survivor Bias-Free Mutual Fund Guide| publisher=CRSP}}{{dead link}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A portion of your [[ordinary dividend]]s may be '''non-qualified dividends''' because they can include items like these:
*'''Taxable interest'''. When a mutual fund receives taxable interest, the income gets paid out as a dividend. It is a dividend when it goes out of the [[mutual fund]], but it was not a dividend when it came into the mutual fund, so it cannot be a qualified dividend.
*'''Non-qualified dividends'''. A mutual fund or [[Exchange-traded fund|ETF]] may distribute dividends that are non-qualified. A fund must hold the security for at least 61 days out of the 121-day period that began 60 days before the security’s [[Dividend#Dates and Timing|ex-dividend date]]. If this requirement is not met, the dividends do not qualify for the long-term [[Capital gains distribution|capital gains]] rate and are treated as ordinary income.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Qualified dividends|url=https://www.fidelity.com/tax-information/tax-topics/qualified-dividends|access-date=July 9, 2025|publisher=Fidelity}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Do ETFs pay dividends?|url=https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/investment-products/etf/dividends-on-etfs|access-date=July 9, 2025|publisher=Fidelity}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note" name=":0"&gt;Certain preferred stock must be held for 91 days out of the 181-day period, beginning 90 days before the ex-dividend date.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Short-term capital gain'''. When a mutual fund or ETF has a short-term capital gain, it pays this amount to the shareholders as an ordinary dividend.
*'''Time period to hold shares'''. To qualify for the long-term capital gains rate, you must own those shares for at least 61 days out of the 121-day period that began 60 days before the security’s ex-dividend date (the same requirement as a fund or stock). Otherwise, the dividend is non-qualified. This requirement applies even if the event is reported to you as a qualified dividend. You do not have to buy the shares 61 days before the dividend is paid, but the total amount of time you hold the shares (including time before and after the dividend) has to be at least 61 days.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" group="note" /&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Stock shares must be held unhedged for at least 61 days out of the 121-day period that began 60 days before the ex-dividend date. "Unhedged" means that no puts, calls, or short sales were associated with the shares during the holding period.&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost all of the dividends distributed by [[REIT |equity REITS]] come in the form of non-qualified dividends. You pay tax on non-qualified dividends at marginal income tax rates.

There are two kinds of prospectuses:&lt;ref name="SEC"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/investing-basics/glossary/mutual-fund-prospectus| title=Mutual Fund Prospectus| publisher=SEC| accessdate=June 21, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The statutory prospectus
* The summary prospectus

The statutory prospectus is the traditional, long-form prospectus with which most mutual fund investors are familiar. The Summary Prospectus, which many funds use, is just a few pages long and contains key information about a fund.

Both kinds of prospectuses contain important information, including the fund's investment objectives or goals, its strategies for achieving those goals, the principal risks of investing in the fund, the fund’s fees and expenses, and its past performance.

You can find more detailed information in the statutory prospectus, including information relating to the fund’s investment advisers and portfolio managers and details on how to purchase and redeem shares.

The SEC specifies the kinds of information that fund prospectuses must include, and requires funds to present key data, such as fees and past performance, in a standard format so that investors can readily compare different funds. Review a fund’s prospectus carefully, and use tools such as a mutual fund cost calculator when analyzing and comparing funds.&lt;ref name="SEC" /&gt;

The SEC is now requiring fund firms to include the underlying expense ratios of business development companies. Vanguard explains this reporting requirement as follows:

{{blockquote|"Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses" are expenses incurred indirectly by the Fund through its ownership of shares in other investment companies, such as business development companies. These expenses are similar to the expenses paid by any operating company held by the Fund. They are not direct costs paid by Fund shareholders and are not used to calculate the Fund’s net asset value. They have no impact on the costs associated with fund operations. Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses are not included in the Fund’s financial statements, which provide a clearer picture of a fund’s actual operating costs.}}

      <text bytes="4782" sha1="fvqmkgrx5fbfs9lmh3bx43x43ucdlxw" xml:space="preserve">'''{{PAGENAME}}''' represent the total value of all the securities in its portfolio, less any liabilities, averaged over a period of time. This is similar to [[:Net asset value| Net Asset Value]], but not divided by the number of shares.

This parameter is useful, as it is the basis to derive several key metrics such as:
*Capital gain "yield", expressed as capital gains / average net assets
*Foreign tax credit estimate, expressed as foreign taxes paid / average net assets
*Commission expense ratios, expressed as  commissions / average net assets
*Redemption to Average Net Asset (R/ANA)
*Redemption to Sales (R/S) ratios

''Average net assets'' is not available in the fund's annual report and must be derived by data mining various SEC filings. Average net assets are not available for [[ETF]] share classes of Vanguard index funds, and must be approximated by averaging the beginning net asset figure, mid year figure, and  year end figure published in annual and semiannual reports.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;A true average net asset figure consists of 13 data points: the beginning net asset figure and the ensuing 12 end of month net asset figures . The annual and semiannual reports document only 3 data points for each fund, a beginning net asset figure, a mid year figure, and a year end figure.

An approximation of average net assets can be expressed for funds that only have a ''single share class'' by using either of these approaches:
*Take net expenses and divide them into the expense ratio. This is simply algebraic substitution. if ER= expenses/average net assets; then average net assets=expenses/ER;
*Take net investment income and divide it into the ratio of net investment income ratio. Similar substitution yields average net assets= investment income/yield.

For funds having multiple share classes (investor, admiral, institutional, ETF), this method does not work because expenses or incomes are not broken down by share class.

''The approach is to then use SEC documented average assets''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==EDGAR database==
Average net assets are found in the Semi-Annual Report, which is available from the [[:EDGAR database]].

'''{{PAGENAME}}s '''are payments a corporation makes to its shareholders. [[Mutual fund]] dividends are distributions to a mutual fund shareholder, representing their share of interest and dividends the fund receives from the assets it holds.

==Stock dividends==
{{Quote
|quote = '''Dividends'''
A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings to its shareholders and is determined by the company's board of directors. Dividends are often distributed quarterly and may be paid out as cash or in the form of reinvestment in additional stock.&lt;br&gt;
The dividend yield is the dividend per share and is expressed as dividend/price as a percentage of a company's share price, such as 2.5%.&lt;br&gt;
Common shareholders of dividend-paying companies are eligible to receive a distribution as long as they own the stock before the ex-dividend date.
|source = —[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividend.asp Investopedia]
}}
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;Dividends are payments a corporation makes to its shareholders. It is the portion of corporate profits paid out to stockholders. When a corporation earns a profit or surplus, it can put that money to two uses: the business can either re-invest it (called retained earnings), or it can pay it to shareholders as a dividend. Many corporations retain a portion of their earnings and pay the remainder as a dividend.&lt;ref&gt;See also: [[wikipedia:Dividend | Dividend]], from Wikipedia&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, dividend payments are based on many factors, and decided by the corporation issuing the stock.&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

Deciding to invest in dividend paying stocks rather than stocks that do ''not'' pay dividends is uncertain at best. There are many reasons to support either position, as well as tax implications for both the issuing corporation and the stockholder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Fischer Black| title=The Dividend Puzzle| publisher=Journal of Portfolio Management, 2| date=1976| page=58| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o20jglECxf8C&amp;pg=PA74&amp;sig=tcAbLtZbMpgYzUpC90n6Joj1m-w#PPA10,M1| accessdate=December 13, 2023}} From Google Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mutual fund dividends==
When a mutual fund pays you a dividend, it is not a payment "for keeping your money in the fund for a year," but rather it is a net after expense distribution to you of your share of interest and dividends the fund received from the assets it holds. The fund must make these distributions, and it is required to decrease the [[net asset value]] (NAV) accordingly, because after paying a dividend the fund holds less wealth. This is true of most equity funds, but not of bond funds.

Your interest in holding a fund is the total return on your investment, which is increase in NAV plus value of distributions. If the fund NAV at the end of the year, after distributions, is actually less than the fund NAV at the beginning of the year, then the capital gain return for that year may have been negative. If you add to that the total of distributions received, the result may still be negative, or it may be positive.

Generally, you can expect both stock and bond funds to have a positive total return in a year, but your actual results in a year can vary widely, and do include negative total returns in some years.

===Dividend distributions===
{{See also|Why did my fund unexpectedly drop in value}}
Dividend distribution in a [[mutual fund]] represents not only bond interest but also stock dividends accumulated in the [[net asset value | NAV]] since the previous distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Forum link|t=48063|title=I don't understand how I made any money 2030 fund}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dividend distributions accumulate in the fund's [[net asset value | NAV]] throughout the year. Then when paid, the fund is reduced by that dividend amount. (This is not true of most Vanguard bond funds, as noted above. See [[net asset value]] (NAV) for more detail.) If you reinvest dividends, then you simply receive additional shares that equal the dividend amount times the number of shares you already owned.

You can think of these distributions as a bookkeeping tool to get stock dividends and bond interest income off the books and out to investors, either by reinvestment in additional shares or as a cash payment.

''For example:'' You own 500 shares at $11 per share at year-end, for a total worth of $5,500. There is a $1 per share dividend. Therefore, net of accumulated dividends in the fund, your fund is worth $10 per share. Assuming dividends are reinvested, you will get $500 ($1 x 500 shares) reinvested in the fund. $500 / $10 per share = 50 additional shares. Now you own 550 shares at $10 each, which equals your original $5,500.

Except for taxes in a taxable account, there is no reason to "time" the dividend in a mutual fund.

===Dividend distributions and fund prices===
If your fund is paying out a dividend or capital gains distribution (sometimes quarterly, often annually), its NAV will drop by the per share amount of the distributions on the ex-dividend date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://finance.zacks.com/happens-sell-dividend-paying-stock-after-receiving-dividend-1631.html| title=What Happens if You Sell a Dividend Paying Stock After Receiving a Dividend?| author=Kevin Johnston| publisher=Zacks.com| date=January 25, 2021| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240813190817/https://finance.zacks.com/happens-sell-dividend-paying-stock-after-receiving-dividend-1631.html| archive-date=August 13, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt; Your economic position does not change because of the distributions, regardless of whether you re-invest the distributions in the fund or take them in cash. Substantial drops in NAV from distributions most often occur in December, when many funds are paying annual dividend and capital gains distributions, especially if the distributions are large.

===Dates and timing===
There are four dates associated with dividends: &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ex-date.asp| title=Ex-Dividend Date: Definition, Key Dates, and Example| author=Jason Fernando| publisher=Investopedia| date=November 8, 2023| accessdate=December 13, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Declaration date''' - the company announces that it will be issuing a dividend in the future
*'''Record date''' - the company examines its current list of shareholders to determine who will receive dividends
*'''Ex-dividend date''' - this determines which of these shareholders will be entitled to receive the dividend
*'''Payable date''' - the dividend is actually paid to eligible shareholders

If you own shares on the record date, you will receive the dividend.

For mutual funds, the record date is one business day before the ex-dividend date. For ETFs, the record date is one business day after the ex-dividend date. The two day difference between mutual funds and ETFs is due to the two-day settlement period for ETFs (and stocks). Therefore, the following holds for both mutual funds and ETFs:

*If you buy shares on or after the ex-dividend date, you will not receive the dividend. If you buy shares before the ex-dividend date, you will receive the dividend.
*If you sell shares on or after the ex-dividend date, you will receive the dividend. If you sell shares before the ex-dividend date, you will not receive the dividend.

Vanguard says that their payable date will usually be two to four business days after the record date.&lt;ref&gt;For example: {{cite web| url={{Vf | vtsax}}| title=VTSAX distribution page| publisher=Vanguard.com| accessdate=December 13, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For mutual funds, Vanguard uses the term ''Reinvest date'' instead of ''Ex-dividend date''.

      <text bytes="7334" sha1="dkxue5y73xvq7lzubeqe9zcs5srglol" xml:space="preserve">{{US|reason=irrelevant}}In the U.S. a '''qualified dividend''' is a type of dividend to which capital gains tax rates are applied. These tax rates are usually lower than regular income tax rates. In contrast, ordinary dividends that do not qualify for this tax preference are taxed at your normal income tax rate.&lt;ref name="Investopedia"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/qualifieddividend.asp| title=Qualified Dividend| publisher=Investopedia| accessdate=March 10, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Qualified dividends were enacted in the The Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003. The Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act of 2005, extended the low qualified dividend tax rates until the end of 2010. The Tax Relief Act enacted in December 2010 extended qualified dividends through 2012. The American Taxpayer Relief Act (ATRA) extended qualified dividends for the years beyond 2012.

Qualified dividends must meet the following requirements:&lt;ref name="Investopedia"/&gt;
* The dividend must have been paid by an American company or a qualifying foreign company.
* The dividends are not listed with the IRS as dividends that do not qualify.
* The required dividend holding period has been met, usually 61 days including the dividend date.&lt;ref group="note"&gt; 
For a summary determining qualified dividend holding periods, refer to: [https://www.fidelity.com/tax-information/tax-topics/qualified-dividends Fidelity: Qualified Dividends]. Additional restrictions are given in [https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/26/1.246-5 IRS Regulations-246.5]. Any day that you have a position on "substantially similar or related property" which diminishes your risk of loss, does not count as part of the holding period. The most common situation in which this would apply is holding an option to sell (put), or writing an option to buy (call) which is not "substantially out of the money."&lt;/ref&gt;

The fraction of dividend distributions from a mutual fund or ETF which are qualified is the same fraction as the qualified dividends are of the income the fund received. However, if at least 95% of the fund's income was from qualified dividends, it can report the dividend as 100% qualified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/854| title=26 U.S. Code § 854 - Limitations applicable to dividends received from regulated investment company| publisher=Cornell Law School| accessdate=March 10, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tax rates==

Mutual fund distributions will be taxed according to the tax laws governing the investment over the holding period of the investment, which are subject to change. The actual tax imposed will depend on your tax rate and the timing of purchases and sales. The federal tax rates applicable to mutual fund distributions and investor sales of securities for the period 2018 onward are outlined below. Keep in mind that investment income may also be subject to state and local taxation. 

Short-term capital gains distributions are made from realized gains on securities held for one year or less. Short-term gains are taxed at ordinary income tax rates. Mutual fund short-term gain distributions are included in a fund's [[Ordinary dividend | ordinary dividend]] distribution; therefore, capital losses may not be subtracted from these distributions when computing taxes.

[[Capital gains distribution |Long-term capital gains distributions]] are made from realized gains on securities held for more than one year. They are reported on tax Schedule D along with any other capital gains, and can be reduced by capital losses.

[[Qualified dividend]]s are the ordinary dividends&lt;ref group="note"&gt;''[https://fairmark.com/investment-taxation/mutual-fund-tax-guide/ordinary-dividends/ Fairmark]'' says:
{{quotation|A portion of your [[Ordinary dividend | ordinary dividend]] may be nonqualified because it can include items like these:

'''Taxable interest'''. When a mutual fund receives taxable interest, the income gets paid out as a dividend. It's a dividend when it goes out of the mutual fund, but it wasn't a dividend when it came into the mutual fund, so it can't be a qualified dividend.

'''Nonqualified dividends'''. Your mutual fund may receive dividends that are nonqualified. For example, the mutual fund may sell shares just 35 days after buying them, but after receiving a dividend. The mutual fund has to hold the shares at least 61 days to have a qualified dividend. Any amount the mutual fund receives as a nonqualified dividend gets paid to you as a nonqualified dividend.

'''Short-term capital gain'''. When a mutual fund has a short-term capital gain, it pays this amount to the mutual fund shareholders as an ordinary dividend.

'''Holding mutual fund shares less than 61 days'''. You should also be aware that any dividend you receive on mutual fund shares held less than 61 days is a nonqualified dividend, even if the mutual fund reports that amount to you as a qualified dividend. You don't have to buy the shares 61 days before the dividend is paid, but the total amount of time you hold the shares (including time before and after the dividend) has to be at least 61 days.|Fairmark}}
Almost all of the dividends distributed by [[REIT |Equity REITS]] come in the form of non-qualified dividends. Non-qualified dividends are taxed at marginal income tax rates. 
&lt;/ref&gt; that are subject to the same tax rate that applies to long-term capital gains. They should be shown in box 1b of the Form 1099-DIV you receive. 

[[Tax loss harvesting | When you sell at a loss]] you will either offset capital gains which would have otherwise been taxed at your capital gains rate or you will offset income (up to $3,000 maximum per year) which would have otherwise been taxed at your marginal income tax rate, or both. If you offset capital gains that would have otherwise not been taxed at all (because your capital gains tax rate is 0%) then this part of the tax loss harvest may be an outright loss.

The Affordable Care Act imposes a Medicare surcharge of 3.8% on all net investment income (NII) once the taxpayer's adjusted gross income exceeds $200,000 (single) or $250,000 (married); while this tax is not part of the income tax, it has the same effect on investors as a higher tax rate. 
{{trim|{{TaxRateTable}}}}

Qualified dividends are the ordinary dividends that are subject to the same rate that applies to net capital gains. They should be shown in box 1b of the Form 1099-DIV you receive from a brokerage firm or mutual fund company. The qualified dividend tax rates are 0%, 15%, and beginning in 2013, a 20% maximum tax.

If you are subject to the [[ACA net investment income tax|Net Investment Income (NII) tax]], a 3.8% surtax for taxpayers whose adjusted gross income surpasses threshold limits,&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The threshold amounts triggering the NII tax are $250,000 for married filing jointly/surviving spouse with dependents; $200,000 for single/head of household; and $125,000 for married filing separately. The threshold amounts are not indexed to inflation. &lt;/ref&gt; your qualified dividend tax rate will increase to 18.8% or 23.8% depending on your marginal tax bracket.

{{Quotation|
'''What funds or variable contracts have SAIs?'''

Mutual funds, ETFs, registered closed-end funds, and some variable contracts generally will have statements of additional information (SAIs).

'''What information is included in an SAI?'''

The SAI conveys additional information about the fund or variable contract that some investors find useful. The SAI may contain expanded discussions of the matters described in the prospectus. The SAI generally includes the fund’s financial statements and additional information about: the history of the fund; officers, directors and persons who control the fund; investment advisory and other services; brokerage commissions; and tax matters.

'''When will I get an SAI?'''

Funds and variable contracts are not required to deliver SAIs to investors unless investors request it. Some funds and variable contracts may not have separate SAIs because they are allowed to include in the prospectus the information required to be disclosed in the SAI.
}}

This article describes the overall process for calculating '''fund management fees and distributions''' to shareholders.

==Management fees==
Management fees work the same for both bond and equity funds.  At the end of each day a fund’s management fee is calculated with the following equation:&lt;ref group="note"&gt;For a leap year, the divisor would be 366. Management fees are annual, regardless of the number of days in a year. (From troysapp, via PM)&lt;/ref&gt;

{|style="border=0; align=left;"
|-
|Management fee for the day = 
|valign=top style="border-bottom: 1px solid #000000" |
([[NAV|Net Asset Value]] x Management Fee Rate)
|-
|||align="center"|365 days
|}

The result of this equation is then booked as a fund expense and a payable each day.  The management fee payable is generally paid either monthly or quarterly.

==Distributions to shareholders==
Distributions from bond funds (including money market funds) and equity funds differ.

===Bond funds===
Typically, bond fund distributions are declared daily and distributed monthly (see some exceptions below).  This is why a shareholder that redeems a bond fund mid-month will receive a residual distribution at month end.

Typically, a daily bond fund distribution calculation goes something like this:

{|style="border=0; align=left;"
|-valign=top
| 
Per Share Dividend Accrual Payable at Month-End = 
|style="border-bottom: 1px solid #000000" |
( Accrued Interest for the day&lt;br&gt;
+ Accretion of Bond Discounts for the day&lt;br&gt;
– Amortization of Bond Premiums for the day&lt;br&gt;
– Daily Management Fee Accrual for the day&lt;br&gt;
– Other Expenses for the day )
|-
|||align="center"|Daily dividend shares
|}

The Daily Dividend Accrual for bond funds is then booked as a distribution to shareholders and as a payable.  The payable is then paid at the end of each month.

This should make sense since the holder of a bond also accrues interest each day.
{{Notice| Some bond funds declare and distribute dividends monthly, such as Vanguard's Short-, Intermediate-, and Long-Term Treasury Index, Short-, Intermediate-, and Long-Term Corporate Bond Index, Mortgage-Backed Securities Index, Total International Bond Index, Emerging Markets Government Bond Index, Core Bond, and Ultra-Short-Term Bond.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Some bond funds declare and distribute dividends quarterly such as Vanguard's Inflation-Protected Securities Fund and Short-Term Inflation-Protected Securities Index, so their distributions and NAV changes are similar to equity funds (explained [[#Equity funds | below]]).}}

===Equity funds===
Equity fund distributions tend to be declared occasionally throughout the year (e.g., quarterly, at year-end, etc.). For both bond funds and equity funds, the fund must pay out at least 98% of its realized net income and/or gains during the year or the fund will be subject to an excise tax (although a few days are granted after the end of the year, which is why Vanguard sometimes pays prior year distributions on January 2 or 3 of the following year. These dividends are usually described as "supplemental dividends").  Funds must also pay out residual net income/gains within 365 days following the close of the fund's year, or be subject to excise tax on that amount as well.

Each year the fund accountants estimate net income and/or gains for the fund trustees.  The trustees then approve the distribution. Most times, though, actual net income and/or gains are difficult to accurately determine.

This is mainly due to [[Real estate investment trust | REITs]], year-end trading, and foreign holdings.  Therefore the fund accountants will often round up their calculations as a cushion against excise tax. This rounding up often results in a return of capital. Generally, funds would rather not make a return of capital distribution, but they'd rather risk that than pay excise taxes.

;1099 forms
Furthermore, accurate 1099s are often not possible until a fund has been audited, its tax return prepared, its tax provision reconciled, and its underlying investment reporting has been received.

However, the inaccuracy of 1099s does not preclude the January 31 deadline for sending out 1099s. This is why amended 1099s are often sent for foreign funds (REIT discrepancies can usually be adjusted for in subsequent periods).

;Dividends
Due to dividends being declared occasionally for equity funds (versus daily for bond funds), residual distributions are not made from equity funds as with bond funds.

This should make sense since the owner of a stock does not accrue dividends each day, but instead dividends are only owed if/when shares are held on the ex-date/record date.

When an equity fund receives a dividend, the fund’s [[NAV]] increases by that dividend. However, this is not exactly the case for bond funds since they accrue interest daily.

For example, if a fund has a per share NAV of $10, and it hits an ex-date/record-date to receive a $1 dividend (per mutual fund share) for an underlying holding, then all things being equal the fund’s per share NAV will be $11.

If the fund shareholder then redeems his share he will receive $11/share.  If, however, the shareholder waits until the fund trustees declare the distribution of the $1 realized dividend (all else being equal) and he holds until the fund shares ex-date/record date, but liquidates before receiving the distribution, the shareholder will receive $10/share plus a $1 dividend.

{{for|additional information|wikipedia:Unit investment trust}}

A '''unit investment trust,''' commonly referred to as a "UIT," is one of three basic types of U.S. investment companies. The other two types are [[Mutual fund | mutual funds]] and [[Closed End Funds | closed-end funds]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sec.gov/answers/uit.htm SEC: Unit Investment Trusts]&lt;/ref&gt; UITs invest in stocks, taxable bonds, and municipal bonds. UITs are sold,with commissions, by brokerages. 

==Size of market==

Of the four investment company structures based on the 1940 Investment Company Act (mutual funds, exchange traded funds, closed end funds, UITs) UITs have the least number of assets under management.

==Characteristics of UITs==

UITs are regulated primarily under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and the rules adopted under that Act, in particular Section 4&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/80a-4 Section 4 -- Classification of Investment Companies]&lt;/ref&gt;  and Section 26.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/80a-26 Section 26 -- Unit Investment Trusts]&lt;/ref&gt;

*A UIT typically issues redeemable securities (or "units"), like a mutual fund, which means that the UIT will buy back an investor’s "units," at the investor’s request, at their approximate net asset value (or NAV).&lt;ref name="SEC"&gt;[http://www.sec.gov/answers/uit.htm Unit Investment Trust], SEC &lt;/ref&gt; Some exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are structured as UITs. Under SEC exemptive orders, shares of ETFs are only redeemable in very large blocks (blocks of 50,000 shares, for example) and are traded on a secondary market.
       
*A UIT typically will make a one-time "public offering" of only a specific, fixed number of units (like closed-end funds). Many UIT sponsors, however, will maintain a secondary market, which allows owners of UIT units to sell them back to the sponsors and allows other investors to buy UIT units from the sponsors.&lt;ref name="SEC"/&gt;
       
*A UIT will have a termination date (a date when the UIT will terminate and dissolve) that is established when the UIT is created (although some may terminate more than fifty years after they are created). In the case of a UIT investing in bonds, for example, the termination date may be determined by the maturity date of the bond investments. When a UIT terminates, any remaining investment portfolio securities are sold and the proceeds are paid to the investors.&lt;ref name="SEC"/&gt;
       
*A UIT does not actively trade its investment portfolio. That is, a UIT buys a relatively fixed portfolio of securities (for example, five, ten, or twenty specific stocks or bonds), and holds them with little or no change for the life of the UIT. Because the investment portfolio of a UIT generally is fixed, investors know more or less what they are investing in for the duration of their investment. Investors will find the portfolio securities held by the UIT listed in its prospectus.&lt;ref name="SEC"/&gt;
       
*A UIT does not have a board of directors, corporate officers, or an investment adviser to render advice during the life of the trust.&lt;ref name="SEC"/&gt;

==Types of UITs==
UITs are usually categorized as either fixed income UITs or equity UITs. The typical minimum investment for a UIT is $1,000, with lower minimums usually granted for [[:Category:IRAs | IRA accounts]]. Most fixed income UITs provide for dividend and principal distribution to a separate similar mutual fund. Many equity UITs allow for dividend reinvestment into the UIT.

===Fixed income UITs===
Fixed income UITs can be subdivided into the following types:

{| class="wikitable"
|+ Fixed Income Unit Investment Trusts
| 
* ''' U.S. Government Securities UITs''': hold  [[Treasury bonds |U.S. Treasury bonds]] and other government notes.
* '''Mortgage-backed securities UITs''':[[Mortgage-backed security | Mortgage-backed securities]] UITs hold  [[GNMA |Government National Mortgage Association (Ginnie Mae)]] or the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) mortgage backed securities.
* '''National municipal bond UITs''':[[Municipal bonds | National municipal bond]] UITs hold bonds issued by states and municipalities.
* '''State municipal bond UITs''':[[Municipal bonds |State municipal bond]] UITs hold bonds issued by a specific state.
*'''Corporate bond UITs''':[[Corporate bonds | Corporate bond ]] UITs hold bonds issued by corporations. UITs are usually made up of investment grade issues, or the UIT may purchase insurance backing for the bonds.
*'''Developed market bonds''':[[Developed market bonds |International bond UITs]] hold debt issues of foreign companies and governments.
|}

Key features of fixed income UITs include the following: 

* The termination date of a fixed income UIT will be determined by the maturity date of the longest term bond held in the trust.
* The monthly dividend income of a UIT will remain fixed until bonds are removed from the portfolio. Removal occurs when a bond matures; [[Municipal bonds#Call risk |when a bond is called]]; or, in a worst case scenario, [[Bond basics#Credit risk |a bond defaults]]. Investors receive the principal distribution of a matured or called bond, and the UIT will subsequently provide lower income from the reduced number of bonds remaining in the trust.
* Fixed income UITs are advertised on yield. Investors must closely examine the bond portfolio since current yield can be enhanced by a UIT holding lower quality bonds, callable bonds, or [[Bond pricing#A Bond's Path Over Time |premium bonds]].&lt;ref&gt; Annette Thau, ''The Bond Book'', (2001), pp. 348 - 350. ISBN 978-0071358620&lt;/ref&gt;

===Equity UITs===

* '''Equity UITs''' are portfolios of preselected [[Domestic/International |domestic and/or international]] stocks. Some equity UITs invest in specific sectors of the US market; some have a value or growth strategy; some may even hold the S&amp;P 500 index stocks. &lt;ref&gt; [https://www.ici.org/pdf/bro_g2uits_p.pdf ICI - A Guide to Unit Investment Trusts.] &lt;/ref&gt;

==Costs==
Unit Investment Trusts have the following costs:
# '''Commissions'''. UITs are sold by brokerages, and usually have a front-end sales charge, which may be reduced by breakpoints for larger investments. There may also be a deferred sales charge. An additional charge, known as the creation and development fee (C&amp;D), covers the costs of organizing the trust.
# '''Annual Fees'''. UITs pay an annual fee to cover administrative, bookkeeping, and trustee expenses.  There are no investment management fees, since the trust is not managed. 

''Cost Example:''

A typical transactional sales charge for UITs issued by First Trust, the largest issuer of UITs, includes the following expenses for the GNMA UIT:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ftportfolios.com/Retail/dp/dpsummary.aspx?fundid=6938 First Trust GNMA 113] &lt;/ref&gt;

|-
|C&amp;D Fee ||align="center" | 0.48%

|}

The prospectus&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.ftportfolios.com/Common/ContentFileLoader.aspx?ContentGUID=ad011150-6235-4543-9f63-874b33c60d02 First Trust GNMA 113 Prospectus] &lt;/ref&gt; provides the following annual expenses for the UIT:

|'''Total''' ||align="center" | '''0.249%'''
|}

==Caveats==
[[File:TheBondBook.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Caption|''The Bond Book'', Annette Thau (2001)]]

While Unit investment trusts provide investors with a diversified portfolio of assets, investors should consider the following features of the UIT market place.

* '''Performance measurement'''. Whereas mutual funds, closed end funds, and exchange traded funds all have widely available public performance data that is tracked, evaluated and benchmarked by such firms as Morningstar and Lipper, there is no such publicly available performance measurement for unit investment trusts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.morningstar.com/classroom2/course.asp?docid=4517&amp;page=4&amp;CN=sample Morningstar Unit Investment Trusts] &lt;/ref&gt; 
* '''Costs'''. The modest annual expense costs of unit investment trusts are offset by the 3% - 5% commission load expense. Low cost mutual fund and exchange traded funds are widely available to investors without the high commission costs. Treasury securities can be directly bought at auction with no transaction or subsequent investment management costs.

Annette Thau, author of ''The Bond Book'' advises asking the following questions before buying a fixed income UIT:

* ''What securities does the UIT hold?''
* ''What is the maturity of the portfolio?''
* ''What is the credit quality of the portfolio?''
* ''If the portfolio is quoting a relatively high yield, are many of the bonds premium bonds? How likely is it that the bonds will be called?''
* ''What is the size of the commission?''
* ''To whom could I resell the UIT if I need to sell before the UIT matures?''
* ''Do you the seller, stand ready to buy back the UIT? At what price?&lt;ref&gt; Annette Thau, ''The Bond Book'', (2001), pp. 348 - 350. ISBN 978-0071358620&lt;/ref&gt;

It sets the legal framework for four types of registered investment companies: 
*Open-end investment companies ([[Mutual fund |mutual funds]]); 
*Closed-end investment companies ([[Closed End Funds |closed end funds]]); 
*[[Exchange Traded Funds |Exchange-traded funds]] (ETFs);
*[[Unit investment trusts]] (UITs). 

In terms of assets under management, the open-end investment company is by far the most common type of US registered investment company.

==Structure==
The Investment Company Act Of 1940 makes the following general requirements for investment companies:
 
#Funds must register with the SEC;
#Funds must disclose information to investors, using a prospectus and statement of additional information, and ongoing periodic reports;
#Regulates any contract between the advisor and the fund.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=John A. Haslem| date=2010| title=Mutual Funds: Portfolio Structures, Analysis, Management, and Stewardship| publisher=Wiley| pp=19-21| isbn=978-0-470-49909-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Open-end investment companies (mutual funds)===

The SEC offers a list of the main features of mutual funds:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/investing-basics/glossary/mutual-funds| title=Mutual Funds| publisher=SEC| accessdate=May 17, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{blockquote|
Here are some of the traditional and distinguishing characteristics of mutual funds:
*Mutual funds generally sell and purchase their shares on a continuous basis, although some funds will stop selling when, for example, they reach a certain level of assets under management.
*Investors purchase shares in the mutual fund from the fund itself, or through a broker for the fund. Investors cannot purchase the shares from other investors on a secondary market, such as the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq Stock Market. The price that investors pay for mutual fund shares is the fund’s current net asset value (NAV) per share plus any fees that the fund may charge at purchase, such as sales charges or loads.
*Mutual fund shares are redeemable. This means that when mutual fund investors want to sell their fund shares, they sell them back to the fund or to a broker acting for the fund. Investors sell their shares at the current NAV per share, minus any fees the fund may charge at redemption, such as deferred sales loads or redemption fees.
*Mutual funds are registered with the SEC and subject to SEC regulation. In addition, the investment portfolios of mutual funds typically are managed by separate entities known as investment advisers that are also registered with the SEC.
}}

===Basic structure===
Mutual funds have the following basic structure:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.ici.org/doc-server/pdf%3A2009_factbook.pdf| title=2009 Investment Company Fact Book| publisher=Investment Company Institute (ICI)| accessdate=May 17, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Structure of a Mutual Fund.png|800px|center]]

===Distribution: load funds===
{{Main|Mutual funds and fees}}
Mutual funds sold by full service brokerages, banks, and commissioned advisors usually impose a sales charge on investors, known as a "sales load". You pay the sales load either when you buy fund shares, or later on when you sell them. This deferred charge is often called a "contingent deferred sales charge" (CDSC). These sales charges are in addition to a fund's [[Expense ratios | expense ratio]] and any other transaction charges a fund may impose. Sales charges are usually labeled as different share classes of a fund, as follows:

*'''A-shares''': A-shares impose a front end charge on initial investment. A fund issuing A-shares might impose a 5% load upon purchase, so that if you make a $10,000 investment into the fund, you would actually invest $9,500 in the fund with $500 going to the sales agent as a commissioned load. A-shares may also have an additional 0.25% annual charge (known as a 12b-1 fee).
*'''B-shares''': B-shares do not charge an upfront load. Instead the shares have a back end redemption fee combined with a 1% annual charge (12b-1 fee). The redemption fee usually declines each year until it eventually reaches zero. The combination of the annual charge and the redemption fee ensures that the full load is eventually paid. The fund's prospectus will show the exact rate at which these fees decline. Ordinarily, B-shares convert to A-shares (and reduced 12b-1 charges) once the CDSC reaches zero.
*'''C-shares''': C-shares do not charge an upfront load. C-shares are sold with a 1% CDSC for the first year, plus a 1% 12b-1 fee. The redemption fee is eliminated during year two. Unlike B-shares, C-shares never convert to A-shares; you pay the added 1% 12b-1 fee for as long as you hold the fund.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.sec.gov/about/reports-publications/investor-publications/introduction-mutual-funds| title=Mutual Funds and Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) – A Guide for Investors| publisher=SEC| accessdate=May 17, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Distribution: no-load funds===

A no-load mutual fund distributes its fund shares directly to investors. This means that a no-load mutual fund does not have any sales charge fees that load funds have. This is a distinct advantage for the do-it-yourself investor. 

However, a no-load fund may have the following fees, in addition to the expense ratio that all funds have:
*'''Transaction fees''': Mutual funds incur costs buying and selling securities for the fund (for more, see [[Mutual funds: additional costs]]). Some funds cover the costs associated with investors' transactions by imposing [[Purchase fee|purchase fees]] and [[Redemption fee |redemption fees]] directly on the investor at the time of the transactions to cover these costs. Unlike sales charges, these fees are usually paid back into the fund. They may also use a redemption fee as a way to deter short term market timing selling of a fund.
*'''Maintenance fees''': Some funds may charge a separate maintenance fee for low balance fund accounts.
*'''12b-1 fees''': A no-load fund can charge a maximum 0.25% 12b-1 fee and still remain classified as a no-load fund. The main reason that a fund might impose a 0.25% is for purchasing access to a brokerage firm's "fund supermarket". The fee allows the brokerage to offer the fund as a "No Transaction Fee" fund in the supermarket.

'''{{PAGENAME}}'''s are capital preservation investment options available in 401(k) plans and other types of savings plans. The funds are comprised of high quality, diversified fixed income portfolios that are protected against interest rate volatility by contracts from banks and insurance companies. Stable value funds are designed to preserve capital while providing steady, positive returns. Stable value funds are conservative and are considered one of the lowest risk investment options offered in 401(k) plans.

The investment objective of stable value funds is to provide capital preservation and predictable steady, returns. During 2008, stable value funds were one of the few 401(k) investments that produced a positive
return. Stable value fund returns generally ranged between 3 to 5 percent for 2008.&lt;ref name="FAQ"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20121122012934/http://stablevalue.org/help-desk/faq/ Stable Value FAQ, What Do You Need to Know about Stable Value Funds In Today’s Challenging Financial Environment?] (web archive), from [http://stablevalue.org/ Stable Value Investment Association].&lt;/ref&gt;

They have return stability similar to a money market fund but generate higher returns. The protection from interest rate volatility is universal and unique to stable value funds.

Stable value funds are offered in approximately half of all [[:401(k)]] plans and some [[:Category:529 plans| 529]] tuition savings plans. Individuals have invested $520 billion in stable value funds through 138,000 [[:Employer Retirement Plans Overview#Defined Contribution Plan | defined contribution plans]], which include [[:457]], [[:403(b)|403(b)]] and [[:401(k)]] plans.&lt;ref name="FAQ"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

All investments have risks associated with them. Stable value funds are considered one of the lowest risk investments offered in 401(k) plans. Because of their low risk and stable, consistent returns they can help diversify 401(k) asset allocation.&lt;ref name="FAQ"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
Stable value funds are structured in two ways: as a separately managed account, which is a stable value fund managed for one specific 401(k) plan; or as a commingled fund, which pools together assets from many 401(k) plans. Commingled funds offer the benefits of diversification and economies of scale for smaller plans.&lt;ref name="FAQ"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Regardless of how stable value funds are structured, they are comprised of a diversified portfolio of fixed income securities that are insulated from interest rate movements by contracts from banks and insurance companies. The protection from interest rate volatility is universal to stable value funds. How this contract protection is delivered depends on the type of stable value fund investment purchased. The contract protection against interest rate volatility is provided through the following investment instruments:&lt;ref name="FAQ"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

*&lt;u&gt;Guaranteed Interest Contract (GIC)&lt;/u&gt;
:A contract with an insurance company that provides principal preservation and a specified rate of return over a set period of time, regardless of the performance of the underlying invested assets. The invested assets are owned by the insurance company and held within the insurer’s general account.

*&lt;u&gt;Separate Account Contract&lt;/u&gt;
:An account held by an insurance company that holds a combination of fixed income securities and provides principal preservation and a specified rate of return over a set period of time. Separate accounts may provide either a fixed rate of return or a periodic rate of return based on the performance of the underlying assets. The assets are owned by the insurance company and are set aside in a separate account solely for the benefit of the specific contract holder.

*&lt;u&gt;Synthetic GIC&lt;/u&gt;
:A diversified portfolio of fixed income securities that are insulated from interest rate volatility by contracts (wraps) from banks and insurance companies. In this arrangement, the 401(k) plan and its participants own the underlying invested assets-the portfolio of fixed income securities that support the stable value fund.

The typical stable value fund will diversify contract protection by investing in more than one instrument type and/or with more than one insurance company or bank.

==Risks==

* Default risk - Insurers which provide the contracts can go bankrupt.  This risk is highest in funds using non-synthetic GICs.  While most stable value funds attempt to diversify this risk by purchasing contracts from multiple insurers,  the risk still exists (particularly since all the firms will be in the same industry--insurance).
* Interest rate lag - While book value accounting prevents NAV losses during rising rate periods, it equally prevents gains during falling rate periods.
* Liquidity risk - Because much of the stability of stable value funds is due to book value accounting, plans often limit withdrawals to certain time periods.

==Regulation==
Stable value funds have multiple layers of government oversight. The vast majority of funds are regulated by the Department of Labor’s Employee Benefits Security Administration and must comply with the federal pension law, [[:Employee Retirement Income Security Act - ERISA | Employee Retirement Security Act (ERISA)]]. Stable value funds in [[:Employer Retirement Plans Overview#Defined Contribution Plan | defined contribution plans]] for state and local governments-[[:457(b) | 457 plans]]-are regulated by the states, which have adopted requirements similar to ERISA.&lt;ref name="FAQ"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the Department of Labor, stable value investment structures provided and/or managed by:
* banks are regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of Currency,
* insurance companies are regulated by the various state insurance departments, and
* commingled investment funds are regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Investment Company Act.

All stable value funds must comply with accounting regulations by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) (for corporate defined contribution plans) or the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) (for state and local defined contribution plans) to qualify for contract value accounting and reporting. Generally, FASB and GASB require that a stable value fund must meet all of the following criteria:
* the contract is effected directly between the fund and issuer and prohibits the sale or assignment of the contract or its proceeds to another party without the consent of the issuer;
* the repayment of principal and interest credited to participants in the fund is a financial obligation of the issuer of the contract. Prospective interest-crediting rate adjustments are permitted as long as they are not less than zero, and the contract issuer must be a financially sound institution;
* the terms of the contract require all permitted participant-initiated transactions with the fund to occur at contract value;
* an event that limits the ability of the fund to transact at contract value with the issuer and limits the ability of the fund to transact at contract value with participants in the fund must not be probable of occurring;
* the fund itself must allow participants reasonable access to their funds.

==Role in a portfolio==
While stable value funds generally do not contain bonds (except in the case of synthetic GICs), they are based on bonds, and their fixed income and low volatility make them ideally suited for the "bond" portion of a portfolio.

==Transfer restrictions==
Be sure to check your employer's plan description regarding stable value funds, as there may be (normally) a 90 day transfer restriction with other accounts.

The intent of this restriction is to force investors to put their money "at risk" before taking advantage of the interest rate spread (difference) between the "stable" value rate and a short term rate of another fund, such as a Money Market fund.

Although both money Market Market and Stable Value funds attempt to maintain a stable asset value, the Stable Value funds invest farther along the yield curve and with the help of insurance contracts. The cost of liquidating these assets in an environment of rising interest rates is expensive to the fund and its remaining investors.

Other investment choices, such as short term and intermediate bond funds, make no pretense of maintaining a "stable net asset value". It is understood that these investments can and will lose money on a day to day basis and are therefore inappropriate for comparison with Stable Value funds.&lt;ref&gt;Forum discussion: [http://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=49556 Stable Value Funds within a 401(k) and transfer restrictions]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' describe fees and sales charges imposed on an individual [[mutual fund]] investor.

Operating a mutual fund involves many costs. All funds incur regular fund operating costs, which include investment advisory fees, marketing and distribution expenses, and custodial, transfer agency, legal, and accounting fees. The fund's '''expense ratio''' shows these (consolidated) costs.

If a [[broker]] or commissioned agent sells the fund, there is usually a sales charge for each purchase (and sometimes also for each sale). These sales charges are known as '''loads''', and funds sold with these sales charges are '''load-funds'''; mutual funds that are directly sold to investors without sales charges are '''no-load funds'''.

Mutual funds also incur costs buying and selling securities for the fund. Some funds cover the costs associated with an individual investor’s transactions by charging transaction fees and redemption charges directly to the investor when buying or selling. Unlike sales charges, these fees are usually paid back into the fund. 
 
==Expense ratios==
{{Main|Expense ratios}}
The annual '''expense ratio''' is a fund's recurring management fees as a percentage of a its assets. It shows what it costs the investment firm to operate the fund.

The expense ratio represents the percentage of the fund's assets that go purely toward the expense of the daily operation of the fund. It is taken out of the fund's assets, which lowers the return to investors.

The major parts of the expense ratio are the management fee and the administrative cost.
*The investment advisory fee or management fee is the money used to pay the manager of the mutual fund.
*Administrative costs are the costs of recordkeeping, mailings, maintaining a customer service line, and so on. These are costs that all funds have, but they vary in size from fund to fund.

==Sales fees==
Sales fees include ''front-end loads'' and ''deferred sales charges'' on broker-sold products; and a 12b-1 marketing fee&lt;ref group="note"&gt; Marketing fees (also known as ''distribution fees'') include fees paid for marketing and selling fund shares, such as compensating brokers and others who sell fund shares, and paying for advertising, printing and mailing prospectuses to new investors, and printing and mailing sales literature. See: [https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/investing-basics/glossary/mutual-fund-fees-and-expenses Mutual Fund Fees and Expenses] from Investor.gov. &lt;/ref&gt; that can be included in the expenses of both ''load funds'' and ''no-load funds''.
 
===Loads===
Mutual funds that use brokers to sell their shares typically compensate the brokers. Funds may do this by charging investors a fee, known as a "sales load" (or "sales charge (load)"), paid to the selling brokers. In this respect, a sales load is like a commission investors pay to buy any type of security from a broker.

Although funds most commonly use sales loads to compensate outside brokers that distribute fund shares, some funds that do not use outside brokers still charge sales loads. The SEC does not limit the size of sales load a fund may charge, but the [http://www.finra.org/index.htm Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)] does not allow mutual fund sales loads to exceed 8.5%. The percentage is lower if a fund imposes other types of charges. Most funds do not charge the maximum.

There are two general types of sales loads: a front-end sales load investors pay when they buy fund shares; and a back-end or deferred sales load they pay to sell their shares.

====Sales charge (load) on purchases====

Front-end sales charges, also known as class A shares, include sales loads that investors pay to buy fund shares. The key point about a front-end sales load is it reduces the amount available to purchase fund shares.

For example, if you write a $10,000 check to a fund to buy fund shares, and the fund has a 5% front-end sales load, the sales load will be $500. The fund deducts this $500 sales load from the $10,000 check (and typically pays it to a selling broker. Assuming no other front-end fees, the remaining $9,500 purchases your fund shares.

Because the sales commission is paid at purchase, class A shares usually do not have any additional ongoing commission fees, although some firms add a further 0.25% 12b-1 fee (see [[#12b-1 fees|below]]) to the fund's expenses. Many load-funds reduce their load charge for large purchases.

|-
|}

====Deferred sales charge (load)====
Deferred sales charge, sometimes referred to as a "deferred" or "back-end" sales load, refers to a sales load that investors pay when they sell fund shares.

When an investor buys shares that with a back-end sales load rather than a front-end sales load, they pay no sales load at purchase, and the fund immediately uses all of their money to purchase fund shares (assuming that no other fees or charges apply at the time).

For example, if you invests $10,000 in a fund with a 5% back-end sales load, and if there are no other "purchase fees", the fund uses your entire $10,000 to purchase fund shares. You do not pay the 5% sales load until you sell your shares, at which point the fund deducts this fee from your sale proceeds. There are usually two types of back-end fee share classes: class B shares, and class C shares.

The most common type of back-end sales load is the "''contingent deferred sales charge''" (CDSC). The amount of this type of load depends on how long the investor holds their shares and typically, for class B shares, decreases to zero if the investor holds their shares long enough. These fees are combined with an ongoing 1% expense fee called a 12b-1 fee (see [[#12b-1 fees|below]]).

For example, a contingent deferred sales load might be 5% if you hold shares for one year, 4% if held for two years, and so on until the load goes away completely. The 12b-1 fee assures that, regardless of when you sell shares, you pay the full commission.

Usually, once the CDSC is reduced to zero, the fund exchanges class B shares into lower cost class A shares (which pay a lower 12b-1 fee or none). Class C shares are sold with a 1% CDSC for the first year, plus a 1% 12b-1 fee. The redemption fee is eliminated during year two. Unlike class B shares, class C shares never convert to A shares; investors pay the added 1% asset charge for as long as the fund is held. The fund's prospectus will show the exact rate at which these fees will decline.

===12b-1 fees===

The 12b-1 fee gets its name from the section in the [[wikipedia:Investment Company Act of 1940|Investment Company Act of 1940]], which lets a mutual fund to pay distribution and marketing expenses out of the fund's assets. The fund's operating expenses include these fees, and the fund deducts them from its returns each year. A fund's prospectus shows full 12b-1 fee information. 

The original intent of a 12b-1 fee was to help market the mutual fund so that its assets would increase. An increase in assets should provide better economies of scale, providing investors with lower annual operational expenses.

Unfortunately, some funds use a 12b-1 fee a hidden way to pay brokers for using the fund. The SEC has limited the 12b-1 fee to 1% annually with maximum of 0.25% going to brokers. No-load fund families often use the 12b-1 fee (0.25%) to purchase "shelf space" on a brokerage's mutual fund "supermarket" platform. The platform then sells these funds as "no transaction fee" funds, but sells no-load funds not paying the fee with an added sales purchase fee.
 
One way to avoid paying unnecessary fees is to only purchase no-load funds. A genuine no-load fund does not have 12b-1 fees, although a fund is allowed to claim it is a "no-load fund" as long as its 12b-1 fee is 0.25% or less per year. No load funds that do not charge 12b-1 fees are often called 100% no-load or true no-load funds.

==Purchase and redemption fees==

As fund shareholders buy and sell fund shares, the fund's investment managers must buy and purchase securities for the fund. These purchases and sales have transaction costs. Some funds impose a transaction fee on investors buying and selling shares. These fees are usually paid back into the fund, to compensate existing shareholders for the costs incurred by transacting shareholders. Typically, as fund assets grow and transaction costs shrink as a percentage of fund assets, the fund reduces and eventually eliminates these fees.

Funds can also use redemption fees to influence shareholder behavior by imposing a cost for redemptions. International stock funds often impose a two month redemption fee on sales as a means of discouraging short term arbitrage trading between time zone differentials in opening and closing price levels. Tax-managed funds also may impose redemption fees as a means of discouraging shareholder turnover.

==The effect of high costs==
Figure 1 shows the investment growth of both a low-cost and a typical high-cost fund.

|}

Both funds assume an initial $10,000 investment and 8% annual growth. The time period is 30 years.

The low-cost fund is no-load and has expenses of 0.2% per year and has an initial value of $10,000. With annual expenses of 0.2% (growth of 7.8% = 8.0 % - 0.20%), the resulting fund value at year 30 is $95,184.

The high-cost fund has an initial 5.75% sales load, expenses of 2.0% per year, and a 0.25% 12b-1 fee. The initial value is $9,425.00 (10,000 - 5.75%). With annual expenses of 2.25% (growth of 5.75% = 8.00% - 2.0% - 0.25%), the resulting fund value at year 30 is $50,430.

The difference between these funds over 30 years is $44,753.

      <text bytes="7528" sha1="b8305c34jyqajetcndb69qk4doj71ef" xml:space="preserve">'''{{PAGENAME}}''' (NAV) represents the market value of the ''component'' assets held in one share of a [[Mutual fund|mutual fund]], [[Exchange-traded funds|exchange-traded fund]] (ETF), [[Closed-end funds|closed-end fund]], or [[Unit investment trusts|unit investment trust]].&lt;ref group="note"&gt; A unit investment trust (UIT) typically issues redeemable securities (or "units"), like a mutual fund, which means that the UIT will buy back an investor’s "units," at the investor’s request, at their approximate net asset value (NAV). Unit investment trusts (UITs) generally must calculate their NAV at least once every business day, typically after the major U.S. exchanges close. &lt;/ref&gt;  Because ETFs and closed-end funds trade like stocks on the stock exchange, their ''shares'' trade at market value, which can be a dollar value above (trading at a premium) or below (trading at a discount) net asset value.

==Explanation for beginners==
A mutual fund is a big package of "assets," often shares of stock. (Other examples of "assets" could be [[Bond basics|bonds]], or "short-term [[Commercial paper|commercial paper]]," or [[Commodities|commodities]] like silver.) The mutual fund itself is divided up into shares. The NAV represents the market value of the assets in one share of the mutual fund. The absolute value isn't important, because you customarily buy mutual funds in any dollar amount you like; nobody cares just how a big piece each share is. 

The actual list of assets the fund holds is listed in the "annual report" and "semiannual report" which are normally linked online from the same place where you get the [[Prospectus|prospectus]]. It is often worth looking at this list, although it can be pretty overwhelming for a total stock market fund that holds stock in 3,000 different companies! 

If you go to a brokerage and say "Buy me $3,000 worth of (say) the mutual fund Fidelity® Growth Company Fund (symbol FDGRX)," since the NAV is $85.92, if you look in your account you will find that it tells you that you have 34.916 shares of the fund and that their market value is about $3,000.00. There's actually roundoff error, you may find that you've ordered $3,000 but received exactly 34.916 shares and it therefore cost you, and is worth, $2999.98 instead of a perfectly exact $3,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Forum post| t=71345| title=Does "Price" = NAV? What are the rounding rules?| date=March 24, 2011| author=nisiprius}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the fund (hopefully) grows, you may look in your account one day and find that instead of $3,000 the holding is now worth $3,100. The NAV is important to understand here because that growth comes in two different ways. First, the market value of the stocks in the fund may have gone up, so each share of the mutual fund is worth more, maybe $88 instead of $85.92. Second, the stocks in the funds have paid some dividends, which the mutual fund itself distributes from time to time. Usually you have the fund reinvest those dividends, so those dividends have the effect of buying more shares, so that instead of the 34.916 shares you started out with, you now have 35.227. 

Your fund holding is worth more because you have more shares and because each share is worth more. The NAV tracks the second part. 

If you're a retiree or for any other reason, you can also tell the fund not to reinvest dividends. If you do that, the number of shares you hold stays exactly the same, the value of your holding reflects only changes in the NAV, and every so often, usually quarterly, the fund pays out a dividend, which typically gets paid into a money market fund that you've designated for that purpose.

===Some quotes from the web===
From Investopedia:
{{quotation|A mutual fund's price per share or exchange-traded fund's (ETF) per-share value. In both cases, the per-share dollar amount of the fund is derived by dividing the total value of all the securities in its portfolio, less any liabilities, by the number of fund shares outstanding.

In the context of mutual funds, NAV per share is computed once a day based on the closing market prices of the securities in the fund's portfolio. All mutual fund’s buy and sell orders are processed at the NAV of the trade date.  However, investors must wait until the following day to get the trade price.

Mutual funds pay out virtually all of their income and capital gains. As a result, changes in NAV are not the best gauge of mutual fund performance, which is best measured by annual total return.

Because ETFs and closed-end funds trade like stocks, their shares trade at market value, which can be a dollar value above (trading at a premium) or below (trading at a discount) NAV.|[http://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nav.asp Investopedia]}}

From a forum discussion:
{{quotation|In general, the value of the fund measured by NAV (Net Asset Value) is the total value of all the assets in the fund at any time.

This number increases and decreases as the market value of the assets held increases and decreases and is also increased by the accumulation of any dividends and interest paid to the fund from the assets held in the fund.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
At the same time, the value is decreased by expenses incurred to operate the fund which include management expenses (listed as the [[Expense ratios| expense ratio]]) and trading costs paid to brokers by the fund as the fund buys and sells securities.

The value of the fund is also reduced by any payouts the fund makes to fund holders, meaning periodic dividends as well as capital gain distributions. Some bond funds at some fund companies do not accrue bond interest payments in the NAV and do not reduce the NAV when paid out, so that can be a complication.|Forum discussion&lt;ref&gt;{{Forum post| t=48063| title=I don't understand how I made any money 2030 fund |date=January 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Bond funds versus equity funds==

Most Vanguard ''bond'' funds accrue interest to the share holders daily.  Here is a typical statement from a prospectus:
{{quotation|Each Fund distributes to shareholders virtually all of its net income (interest less expenses) as well as any net capital gains realized from the sale of its holdings. The Fund’s income dividends accrue daily and are distributed monthly.}}
The term ''accrue'' used in this sense means that the income dividends are credited to your account each day, just like interest in a savings account that accrues daily.  Since the money set aside for your dividends is both an asset of the fund and a liability, it does not affect the calculated net asset value.  When the fund distributes the income dividends at the end of the month, the net asset value does not change as both the assets and liabilities decrease by exactly the same amount. If you sell all of your bond fund shares in the middle of the month, you will receive as proceeds the value of your shares (calculated as number of shares times net asset value) plus a separate distribution of the accrued income dividends.

In most ''equity'' funds and ''balanced'' funds, dividends do not accrue to you; and you only become entitled to them if you hold the fund on the distribution date.  Therefore, accumulated dividends are not liabilities of the fund; as dividends come into the fund, the net asset value increases.  Only when the dividends are paid out does the net asset value decrease by the dividend amount.

A few Vanguard funds (and some non-Vanguard funds) which trade assets with high trading costs charge '''purchase fees'''. Unlike loads or commissions charged by brokers, these fees are paid back to the fund, and so benefit fundholders by ensuring that the trading costs caused by shorter-term traders do not reduce the fund value for longer-term investors.

==Why purchase fees exist==
If a fund invests $1,000,000 in stocks with low trading volume, it may lose a significant amount in commissions, [[bid/ask spread]]s, and market impact, and might wind up with only $980,000 worth of stock. If the fund charges a 2% purchase fee, then existing investors are not affected by this purchase, and the new investors who invested the $1,000,000 have $980,000 worth of shares, which is all the fund received. If the fund is an index fund, this arrangement helps the fund track the index.

Many funds with purchase fees also charge [[redemption fee]]s for the same reason; if the fund needs to sell more than it buys, it will incur costs in selling its assets

Purchase fees usually decrease as the fund gets larger, and sometimes go away entirely. Although trading does not become less expensive, the trading costs only apply to net purchases. If the example fund above receives $1,000,000 in sale orders and $2,000,000 in purchase orders, it need only invest $1,000,000 in stock, and the $20,000 lost to trading costs is only 1% of the purchases, which would make a 1% fee a fair charge. If the fund receives equal amounts in sale and purchase orders, then there is no cost.

Vanguard does not charge a purchase fee on reinvested distributions, because it does not need to purchase any securities to reinvest the distributions. Therefore, you may want to reinvest distributions in a fund which charges a purchase fee.

==Avoiding purchase fees==
You can avoid paying a purchase fee by using an [[exchange-traded fund]] (ETF). You will still pay a fee to purchase the fund, because you buy ETFs in a brokerage account, and you will pay a commission, bid-ask spread, and possibly a market impact cost of your own if the ETF has a low trading volume. Compare the costs of the [[mutual fund]] and ETF, including the expense difference; most ETFs have lower costs than Investor shares of the fund but about the same cost as Admiral shares. Therefore, it is often worthwhile to buy an ETF in order to avoid the purchase fees unless you expect to have Admiral shares soon.

A '''capital gains distribution''' occurs when [[mutual fund]]s, [[closed-end funds]], and [[exchange-traded fund]]s (ETFs) distribute the capital gains realized in their investment portfolios to shareholders.

If you hold funds in taxable accounts, these distributions are taxable. Your tax rate depends on how long the fund has held the investment, and also on your own marginal tax rate. The two types of distributions from stock and bond funds are termed short-term gains and long-term gains.{{#tag:ref|Special tax considerations apply to commodity asset classes and fund structures:
*Precious metals and grantor's trusts: the IRS considers precious metals to be collectibles.
*Commodity futures are subject to a 60/40 long term/short term blended tax obligation. Limited partnership ETFs are considered pass-through investments. Each year gains are marked-to-market and passed through to investors as a potential taxable obligation, regardless of whether the shares are sold or held.
* Exchange traded notes based on equity investments are subject to marginal long term capital gains rate or marginal short term income tax rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.indexuniverse.com/docs/110411IU_ETF_Taxation_v5A_%20j9.pdf| title=The Complete Guide to ETF Taxation| publisher=indexuniverse.com| date=November 2011| accessdate=October 31, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group="note"}}

*Short-term capital gains distributions are from gains realized on securities the fund held for one year or less. You pay tax on short-term gains at ordinary income tax rates. Funds usually include short-term gain distributions in their [[Ordinary dividend | ordinary dividend]] distribution. This means that you cannot use capital losses to offset your tax on these distributions.
*Long-term capital gains distributions are from gains realized on securities the fund held for more than one year. You report these on your tax return's Schedule D, along with any other capital gains, and you can reduce them with capital losses.

Typically, funds distribute capital gains near the end of the year, often in December. If you hold funds in taxable accounts, it is usually best to invest in new funds ''after'' a fund has distributed any capital gains. This avoids an unnecessary tax liability.

A ''' balanced fund''' is a [[Mutual fund |mutual fund]] that holds multiple [[Asset class | asset classes]]. Typically these funds hold a [[Stock basics|stock]] component; a [[Bond basics|bond]] component, and in some instances, a [[Money markets|cash]] component.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/balancedfund.asp| title=Balanced Fund: Definition, Investment Mix, Examples| publisher=Investopedia| accessdate=August 27, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some balanced funds restrict stock market investments to U.S. stocks; some funds include both [[Domestic/international|U.S. stocks and international stocks]]. Some balanced funds may add non-traditional assets, such as precious metals and commodities, to traditional stock and bond assets. 

Balanced funds may maintain a fixed [[Asset allocation | asset allocation]], or may have a variable allocation policy, changing asset weightings according to market conditions. [[Target date retirement funds | Target date funds]] are balanced funds that gradually change asset class weightings to match an investor's presumed need for a lower risk profile over time.

==Types of balanced funds==
{{Quote
|quote = &lt;u&gt;John Bogle on selecting a balanced fund&lt;/u&gt;
* Invest principally in mainstream funds.
* Differentiate carefully among balanced funds’ various investment strategies.
* Focus on long term returns, especially the year-to year variations in returns.
* Know what makes the fund tick, especially the fund's technical factors: R-squared, beta, and gross yield.
* Focus on the quality of a balanced fund's bond portfolio; the fund should hold high quality bonds.
* Consider the costs of investment. Hold funds with the lowest expense ratio and lowest transaction costs.
|source = —''[[Special:BookSources/978-0-440-50682-9|Bogle on Mutual Funds]]''
}}
Balanced funds differ not only in investment strategy and costs but also in how the fund is structured. Multi-asset funds come in the following forms.
* '''Balanced fund''': Many balanced funds directly hold investments such as [[Stock basics | stocks]] and [[Bond basics | bonds]]. These type funds are designed to hold a specified range of asset allocations for each asset. Most balanced funds have a policy of investing between 60%-65% stocks and 35%-40% bonds; others have a more conservative allocation with 30% in stocks and 70% in bonds. Balanced funds can be either actively managed or [[Indexing |indexed]].
* '''Fund-of-funds''': A number of balanced funds do not hold individual securities, but rather hold shares in other mutual funds or [[ETFs | exchange-traded funds]]. These types of funds are known as [[Fund of funds | fund of funds]]. The underlying funds are usually funds offered by a fund family, but some fund-of-funds select mutual funds from numerous fund families. The SEC requires that fund-of-funds account for the expenses incurred by the underlying funds as [[Acquired fund fees and expenses | acquired fund fees]]. The fund may also charge a direct [[Expense ratios | expense ratio]] for managing the fund. The underlying funds can be either actively managed or indexed. 
* '''Life cycle fund''': Life cycle funds are a group of funds holding varying ranges of fixed stock/bond allocations reflecting various risk levels. These are usually labeled as conservative, moderate, or aggressive portfolios. These funds are primarily designed for retirement and [[529 plans | 529 college savings plans]].&lt;ref group="note"&gt;529 savings plans usually refer to life cycle funds as static portfolios or as multi-fund portfolios, and to target date funds as age-based funds.&lt;/ref&gt; They are often structured as funds-of-funds. The underlying funds can be either actively managed or indexed. 
* '''Target date fund''': These funds hold a mix of stocks and bonds that gradually shifts from higher stock allocations to lower stock allocations over time. The target date is set either for a given investor's projected retirement age or for a term ending at a time when the portfolio assets are needed for a targeted payout date. Target date funds are primarily designed for retirement and 529 college savings plans. Different fund families can have widely different asset allocations for the same target year, and differing [[Glide paths | glide paths]] for changing the asset allocation, so it is always advisable to check the underlying asset allocation of a target fund, rather than relying on a fund's target date. Target-date funds are often designed as funds-of-funds, with the underlying funds being either actively managed or indexed.
*''' Asset allocation fund''': Instead of holding fixed allocations to stocks, bonds, and cash, an asset allocation fund allows the manager to vary the fund allocations according to market conditions.
*'''Managed payout funds''': These funds are balanced funds that incorporate a formulaic spending policy into the fund's investment policy. The investor retains access to the account balance, which will fluctuate with market performance. Neither principal nor payments are guaranteed. Managed payout funds generally fall into two basic categories:
**''' Endowment-like funds'''. These funds are designed to generate regular payouts while striving to preserve (or in some cases grow) the principal. As with an endowment, the fund’s withdrawal strategy is based on a predefined rule, such as a percentage of the rolling three-year average of the fund’s net assets. ([[Vanguard]] adopts this approach for their managed payout fund.)
**''' Time-horizon funds'''. With this type of fund, payments are managed so as to exhaust the investor's account over a specified period, for example 10, 20, or 30 years. The goal is to provide regular payouts from earnings and principal consistently over a given time period. The intent is that, at the end of the time period, the fund balance will be exhausted with the last payout. ([[Fidelity]] adopts this approach for their managed payout funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://vanguard.com/pdf/icrria.pdf| title=Income in retirement: Common investment strategies| author1=Maria A. Bruno| author2=Yan Zilbering| publisher=Vanguard Research| date=June 2010}}{{dead link}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

==Arguments for balanced funds==
Proponents of balanced funds make the following arguments.

* '''Simplicity''': According to Vanguard Research authors Bruno and Donaldson&lt;ref name="Bruno"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.vanguard.com/pdf/s908.pdf| title=Single fund investment options: Portfolio construction simplified for investors| author1=Maria A. Bruno| author2=Scott J. Donaldson| publisher=Vanguard Research| date=April 2011}}{{dead link}}&lt;/ref&gt; a single balanced fund offers investors the convenience of a predefined asset allocation policy and risk control through automatic rebalancing and diversification.
* '''Avoiding behavioral mistakes''': Research indicates that when investors are confronted with a multitude of investment options they tend to not make decisions at all or choose to spread their assets across many investments with no strategic plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://403bwise.com/pdf/vcrr_choice_study.pdf| title=Can there be too much choice in a retirement savings plan?| author1=Gary R. Mottola| author2=Stephen P. Utkus| publisher=Vanguard Research| date=2003| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190117212330/https://403bwise.com/pdf/vcrr_choice_study.pdf| archive-date=January 17, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; A broadly diversified balanced fund is one solution that mitigates this conduct. Evidence from investor returns also indicates that investors are prone to chasing investment performance. Morningstar data for the ten year period ending December 31, 2010 reveals the difference in the returns investors received in equity funds, bond funds, and balanced funds in comparison with fund returns over the period. Equity investor returns lagged fund returns by about 1.4 percentage points; bond investor returns lagged fund returns by 1.2 percentage points. This compares with the lower differentials realized by balanced fund investors: a 0.54 percentage point differential for conservative balanced funds, and a 0.73 percentage differential for moderate balanced funds. Bruno and Donaldson assert that the balanced categories would seem to make investors less susceptible to performance chasing because each particular segment would not be separately visible within an investor’s portfolio.&lt;ref name="Bruno" /&gt;
* '''Automatic rebalancing''': A balanced fund automatically rebalances to its stated asset allocation targets. This rebalancing keeps the investor’s desired risk exposure constant. Automatic rebalancing is especially important after periods of extreme market stress and uncertainty, times when investors find it difficult to reallocate funds into recent poor performing asset classes. In another Vanguard study, authors Davis and Pequet examined balanced investing during recessionary periods from 1926- 2010 for a monthly rebalanced, indexed 50% US equity/ 50% US bond portfolio.&lt;ref name="Davis"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://personal.vanguard.com/pdf/icrrbp.pdf| title=Recessions and balanced portfolio returns| author1=Joseph Davis| author2=Daniel Piquet| publisher=Vanguard Research| date=October 6, 2011}}{{dead link}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such frequent regular rebalancing is much easier to implement for an automatically rebalanced balanced fund. Over this period, nominal and real returns for the portfolio during recessions and expansions are indicated in the following table:
* '''Vanguard balanced funds offer lower minimum investment''': Vanguard offers low $1,000 minimum investment thresholds for a number of its fund-of-fund balanced fund offerings. For index investors, Vanguard sets the low minimum for its series of [[Vanguard target retirement funds | target date retirement funds]]. For investors who prefer actively managed portfolios, Vanguard offers its [[Vanguard STAR fund | STAR fund]] at the same low minimum investment. These low minimums make it easier to begin an investment program with a broadly diversified portfolio.

==Arguments against balanced funds==
Critics of balanced funds make the following points.
*''' One size fits all''': A balanced fund’s selection and weighing of asset classes may not match an investor’s desired asset allocation policy. This may be true for investors wishing to [[Value tilting - stock | tilt]] portfolios towards holding more value and/or more small cap stocks; hold more or less international stocks; or add additional asset classes, such as [[Real estate investment trust |real estate]], precious metals, commodities, [[Treasury Inflation Protected Securities |inflation indexed bonds]], or [[Developed market bonds |foreign bonds]] to the portfolio mix. In the case of a target date fund, the glide path may not correspond to an investor's risk tolerance. For these investors, using separate funds for each asset class is likely to be the proper strategy.
* '''Tax considerations''': In an attempt to increase a portfolio's [[Principles of tax-efficient fund placement | tax efficiency ]], investors having both taxable and tax-advantaged accounts may find holding individual asset class funds preferable to holding a single balanced fund. Under this scenario, tax-efficient investments (such as broad-market stock index funds/exchange-traded funds, low-yielding bond funds, and tax-managed funds) are held in taxable accounts and tax-inefficient investments (such as high yielding taxable bonds, REITs, and actively managed stock funds) are held in tax-advantaged accounts. Such an asset location policy also provides flexibility for the investor to strategically [[Tax loss harvesting | realize losses]] in the more volatile equity asset classes held in the taxable account. An additional tax factor involves qualifying for the [[Foreign tax credit | foreign tax credit]]. The credit only applies to international stocks held in the taxable account. The optimal conditions for applying asset location to an [[Investment policy statement | investment policy]] are situations where an investor has both a sizable taxable account in relation to tax-advantaged accounts, and where an investor has a long holding period.&lt;ref name="Bruno" /&gt;
* '''Cost issues''': Vanguard offers lower cost admiral shares for most of its suite of index funds for a typical minimum investment of $3,000. Admiral shares are not available for Vanguard balanced index funds structured as fund-of-funds (LifeStrategy funds, Target Retirement funds). Investors with higher account values may find it preferable to hold the admiral share individual asset class funds instead of the balanced fund.

'''Mutual fund history''' tracks the history of mutual funds, which are registered investment companies that pool investors' capital for the purpose of investing in securities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://investor.gov/investing-basics/investment-products/mutual-funds Mutual Funds], from [http://investor.gov/about-us Investor.gov] (SEC), viewed September 09, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Mutual funds are managed by professional money managers. They are a primary funding vehicle for the corporate contributory retirement system in the United States.

==History==

===Eighteenth century===

[[File:ConcordiaResPC.jpg|200px|thumb|Concordia Res Parvae Crescunt Certificate,1893]]
The history of the [[Mutual fund |mutual fund]] can be traced to the thriving late 18th century markets in Amsterdam. In July of 1774, an Amsterdam broker by the name of Abraham van Ketwich offered on the market a diversified pooled security specifically designed for citizens of modest means. The security was known as a ''negotiatie'', an instrument very similar to the present day [[:Closed End Funds |closed-end fund]]. This first negotiatie, ''Eendragt Maakt Magt'', invested in bonds issued by foreign governments and banks and in plantation loans in the West Indies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ssrn.com/abstract=636146 |title=The Origins of Mutual Funds  |last=Rouwenhorst |first=Geert K. |date= December 12, 2004|publisher=Yale ICF Working Paper No. 04-48|pages=5-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The issue was successful and van Ketwich introduced his second negotiatie, ''Concordia Res Parvae Crescunt'' in 1779, with more freedom in investment policy. The prospectus stated that the negotiatie would invest in "solid securities and those that based on decline in their price would merit speculation and could be purchased below their intrinsic values..."&lt;ref&gt; Rouwenhorst (2004) p.7&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Concordia Res Parvae Crescunt'' existed for 114 years; in 1893 it was officially dissolved.&lt;ref&gt;Rouwenhorst(2004) p.11&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1780s and 1790s more than thirty negotiaties emerged to speculate on the future credit of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Rouwenhorst (2004) p.12&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nineteenth century===

When the pooled investment structure crossed over to the English markets in the nineteenth century it evolved into the investment trust, essentially a closed-end fund. The first investment trust, ''Foreign and Colonial Government Trust'',  was founded in 1868 in London. The trust invested in foreign government bonds. The most famous  of these investment trusts was Robert Fleming's ''First Scottish American Investment Trust'' invested in U.S. railroad bonds.&lt;ref&gt;Rouwenhorst (2004) pp. 16-17.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1890s the investment trust had migrated to the American markets. ''The Boston Personal Property Trust'', formed in 1893, was the first closed-end fund in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.investopedia.com/articles/mutualfund/05/MFhistory.asp A Brief History Of The Mutual Fund], James E. McWhinney, investopedia&lt;/ref&gt;

===Twentieth century===

The 1920s saw the creation of the first open-end mutual fund, ''Massachusetts Investors' Trust'' in Boston, Massachusetts (1924). The fund went public in 1928, a year which also saw Scudder, Stevens and Clark launch the first no-load fund and the creation of the ''Wellington Fund'', the first mutual fund to include a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds. By 1929 there were 19 open-ended mutual funds competing with nearly 700 closed-end funds. The stock market crash of 1929 wiped out many highly-leveraged closed-end funds; the small open-end funds managed to survive. The ensuing round of 1930s financial legislation laid the groundwork for the contemporary mutual fund industry. The era saw the creation of the SEC&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sec.gov/ Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)] &lt;/ref&gt;, the passage of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Investment Company Act of 1940 followed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sec.gov/about/laws.shtml#secact1933 The Laws That Govern the Securities Industry]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.investopedia.com/articles/mutualfund/05/MFhistory.asp A Brief History Of The Mutual Fund], James E. McWhinney, investopedia&lt;/ref&gt; The act set the legal framework for four types of registered investment companies in the United States: 
*Open-end investment companies (mutual funds); 
*Closed-end investment companies ([[Closed-end funds| Closed-end funds]]); 
*[[Exchange-traded funds |Exchange-traded funds]] (ETFs);
*[[Unit investment trusts | Unit investment trusts]] (UITs).

[[File:Nathan Most.jpg|200px|thumb| Nathan Most, originator of the Exchange Traded Fund]]
The postwar period marked an era of substantial growth for the U.S. mutual fund industry. By 1951 there were more than 100 mutual funds in existence, and 150 more funds were added over the next two decades.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.investopedia.com/articles/mutualfund/05/MFhistory.asp A Brief History Of The Mutual Fund], James E. McWhinney, Investopedia&lt;/ref&gt; At the close of the buoyant late 1960s stock markets, U.S. mutual funds held an average 87% of their assets in stocks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kc.frb.org/PUBLICAT/EconRev/EconRevArchive/1992/3q92sell.pdf  Sellon, Gordan H. Jr., Changes in Financial Intermediation: The Role of Pensions and Mutual Funds], Economic Review Third Quarter 1992, The Federal Reserve&lt;/ref&gt; The ensuing major 1973-1974 bear market in stocks and high inflation during the decade resulted in investor redemptions and shrinking assets for mutual funds. The challenging 1970-1980 decade was marked by a number of innovations. Bruce R. Bent established the first money market fund in the U.S., ''The Reserve Fund'', in 1971, which allowed savers and investors access to the high, often double digit, [[Money markets|money market]] yields during an age of regulated bank interest rates (5.25% maximum.) The money market fund was very successful. In 1982, mutual fund assets consisted of 76% of assets in money market funds, 8% in bond funds, and 16% in stock funds.&lt;ref&gt;John Bogle (2001), Economics 101: For Mutual Fund Investors... For Mutual Fund Managers, ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=zcC-AAAAIAAJ&amp;q=John+Bogle&amp;dq=John+Bogle&amp;cd=5 John Bogle on Investing]'', McGraw-Hill, ISBN	0071364382.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:JohnCBogle.jpg|200px|thumb|left|John C. Bogle, founder of the first retail Index Fund]]
The decade saw [[:John Bogle]] create a unique mutualized mutual fund firm, Vanguard, in 1975. The following year Bogle launched the first retail index fund,'' First Index Investment Trust'', based on the [[S&amp;P 500 index|S&amp;P 500 Index]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://onlinepressroom.net/vanguard/ Vanguard: History]&lt;/ref&gt; A number of this era's tax initiatives laid the foundations for growth in the U.S. mutual fund industry. The [[Traditional IRA |traditional IRA]] was created in 1974 (much liberalized after 1984); in 1976 the law not allowing mutual funds to pass through tax exempt income to investors was amended, thus spawning [[Municipal bonds | municipal bond]] funds&lt;ref&gt;
John Bogle, [http://www.vanguard.com/bogle_site/lib/sp19991110.html Giving the Bond Fund Investor a Fair Shake], Upon Induction Into The Hall of Fame of the Fixed Income Analysts Society, Inc., New York, New York, November 10, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;; and the [[:401(k)|401(k)]] corporate retirement plan came into existence in 1981. Mutual funds were to become the primary funding vehicle for both IRAs and 401(k) plans. 

In 1993, [[Nathan Most]], an executive with the AMEX stock exchange, building on earlier efforts (1989 Index Participation Shares, halted by litigation, and 1990 Toronto Index Participation Shares) developed the [[Exchange-traded funds |exchange-traded fund]] with ''Standard &amp; Poor's Depositary Receipts'' ("spiders"), based on the S&amp;P 500 Index .&lt;ref&gt;Gary L. Gastineau (2002), ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=CIYoyIrP6cIC  The Exchange-Traded Funds Manual]''. John Wiley and Sons. pp. 32. ISBN 978-0471218944.&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
The extended bull markets in stocks and bonds over the last two decades of the twentieth century resulted in explosive growth for the mutual fund industry. At the end of 1999, there were 7,791 mutual funds in the United States, holding over 6.8 trillion dollars of assets. The growth phenomenon was worldwide: the year ended with 52,746 mutual funds in the world, holding 11.39 trillion dollars of assets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ici.org/pdf/2004_factbook.pdf ICI 2004 Mutual Fund Factbook]&lt;/ref&gt;  The asset class holdings of the US mutual fund industry held 59% stocks; 6% balanced; 12% bonds; and 24% money markets at century's end.

===Twenty first century===
[[File:2000-2002 bear market.png|thumb|right|350px|2000-2002 stock returns. Wilshire 5000 Index and MSCI AWCI ex-US Index. Returns are expressed in dollar terms.]]
The first decade of the twenty-first century saw historic bear markets in stocks at the beginning and end of the decade. The year 2003 also revealed scandal in the  U.S. mutual fund industry. 

In the U.S., high equity valuations, economic recession, and the 2001 terrorist attacks augured a three-year period of negative returns in the U.S. stock market. Global markets also fell during this period (see accompanying chart). In the U.S. this period was marked by corporate accounting malfeasance. The legislative response was the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.congress.gov/bill/107th-congress/house-bill/3763 H.R.3763 - Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002]&lt;/ref&gt;

====U.S. mutual fund scandal====
On September 3, 2003, New York Attorney General Elliot Spitzer launched an investigation into late trading&lt;ref&gt; [[Eric Zitzewitz|Zitzewitz, Eric]], ''[http://ssrn.com/abstract=456360 How Widespread is Late Trading in Mutual Funds?]'' (September 2003). Stanford GSB Research Paper No. 1817.SSRN&lt;/ref&gt; and market timing focused on the activities of hedge fund Canary Capital Partners, LLC, its managers, and four mutual fund companies with which it had formal trading agreements: Bank of America, Janus Capital Group, Bank One, and Strong Capital Management. By the end of the investigation, charges were leveled against over twenty mutual fund companies and brokerage firms.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Middleton (12/9/2003) [http://moneycentral.msn.com/content/P66897.asp Mutual Funds:The mutual fund scandal and you]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Houge"/&gt; Seventeen firms made settlements with prosecutors and paid $3.11 billion in fines.&lt;ref name="Houge"&gt;Houge, Todd and Wellman, Jay, [https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&amp;hl=en&amp;user=jkm0msUAAAAJ&amp;citation_for_view=jkm0msUAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC Fallout from the mutual fund trading scandal], Journal of Business Ethics, Volume 62, Issue 2, pp. 129-139, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;

Fallout from the scandal forced the resignations of Lawrence Lasser, CEO of Putnam Investments ,&lt;ref&gt;[http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/perfi/funds/2003-11-03-fund-cover_x.htm Scandal outrage keeps growing...],B John Waggoner, Christine Dugas and Thomas A.

Atlas, New York Times, May 21, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

The SEC considered a number of mutual fund initiatives &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sec.gov/news/testimony/ts060705lar-attach1.pdf SEC Mutual Fund Initiatives]&lt;/ref&gt; in response to the scandals. Final rules primarily involved increased information disclosure and enhanced compliance procedures, including the designation of a chief compliance officer.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/ia-2204.htm Final Rule:Compliance Programs of Investment Companies and Investment Advisers], SEC, 17 CFR Parts 270 and 275&lt;/ref&gt;

====The 2008 financial crisis====
{{Main|The 2008 money market crisis}}

The financial crisis in 2008 triggered a freeze in U.S. money markets. On September 16, the day after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, the Reserve Fund, the nation's oldest money market fund, held Lehman paper totaling 1.2% of the fund's assets. Losses on this defaulted paper caused a drop in the fund's net asset value to 0.97 cents per share. The result was a bank run, as first, institutional investors and then retail investors began redeeming funds holding corporate paper for exchange into funds holding government and treasury paper. The market for commercial paper simply did not trade. The Federal Reserve intervened with temporary programs to liquefy the commercial market and to provide government insurance for money market funds.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2014/08/14/2014-17747/money-market-fund-reform-amendments-to-form-pf Money Market Fund Reform; Amendments to Form PF], Federal Register, Section D, August 14, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;Ref group="note"&gt;Each Federal reserve program had a specific purpose and a finite life span:
* [http://www.finra.org/investors/protectyourself/investoralerts/mutualfunds/p117136 Treasury’s Temporary Guarantee Program for Money Market Funds] provided insurance for investor money fund accounts. The program was initially in effect for three months, beginning September 19, 2008, but was later extended through September 18, 2009. Treasury did not extend the program beyond September 18, 2009.
* [http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/reform_mmiff.htm Money Market Investor Funding Facility (MMIFF)] provided liquidity to U.S. money market mutual funds in order to increase their ability to meet redemption requests and to enhance money market investors' willingness to invest in money market instruments, particularly for terms longer than overnight. The facility was announced on October 21, 2008, and was closed on October 30, 2009.  
* [http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/reform_amlf.htm Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility (AMLF)] provided liquidity that allowed money funds to sell asset-backed commercial paper. The facility was announced on September 19, 2008, and was closed on February 1, 2010. 
* [http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/reform_cpff.htm Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF)]  allowed the Federal Reserve to directly purchase commercial paper, providing liquidity to the market. The facility was announced on October 7, 2008, began purchases of commercial paper on October 27, 2008, and was closed on February 1, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the U.S. the crisis resulted in a series of new regulations for the mutual fund industry. The main thrust of the regulations centered on steps designed to bolster fund liquidity, improve fund compliance with regulations, and increase informational transparency. 

The SEC imposed new [[Money markets#Money fund regulation|regulations]] on money market funds, first in 2010,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sec.gov/news/press/2010/2010-14.htm SEC Approves Money Market Fund Reforms to Better Protect Investors], SEC press release, Jan. 27, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and again in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sec.gov/News/PressRelease/Detail/PressRelease/1370542347679 SEC Adopts Money Market Fund Reform Rules], SEC press release, July 23, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2015, in keeping with the emphasis on regulating liquidity, the SEC proposed liquidity management rules for mutual funds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sec.gov/news/pressrelease/2015-201.html SEC Proposes Liquidity Management Rules For Mutual Funds And ETFs], SEC press release, Sept. 22, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise, the European Union established regulatory reforms in financial services after the crisis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/finance/investment/ucits-directive/index_en.htm UCITS]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/finance/finservices-retail/investment_products/index_en.htm#maincontentSec2 Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014, Key Information Document (KID)]&lt;/ref&gt;  The European Union also proposed rule changes for money market funds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/finance/investment/money-market-funds/index_en.htm Money Market Funds], Proposal of the European Commission – 04.09.2013, September 4, 2013 &lt;/ref&gt;

====Mutual fund trends in the first quarter century====
Two persistent trends have marked the global mutual fund universe in the on-going first quarter of the twenty-first century. The first noticeable trend is the rapid growth of the exchange-traded fund. From an asset base of $66 billion dollars in 2000, world-wide exchange-traded funds measured assets of $4.7 trillion at 2018 year-end.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.icifactbook.org/ch4/19_fb_ch4#total ICI 2019 Factbook], Chapter Four, ICI 2019 Investment Company Factbook&lt;/ref&gt;

The second prominent trend at the beginning of the century is the growth of index funds. In the U.S. index funds held 9% of total net long-term fund assets in 2000. The percentage had grown to 36% of total long-term fund assets by year-end 2018.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.icifactbook.org/ch2/19_fb_ch2#growth ICI 2019 Factbook], Chapter 2, ICI 2019 Investment Company Factbook &lt;/ref&gt;

A '''fund of funds''' is a mutual fund which holds other mutual funds, rather than individual stocks or bonds.

__TOC__

==General recommendations==
Funds of funds are excellent investments for getting started in an [[IRA]] or [[401(k)]] because they offer a complete portfolio for a small investment.  Often, the best way to start an IRA is with the appropriate [[Vanguard target retirement funds]]; you can always change to a more complicated portfolio later.

It is normally best to avoid a fund of funds in a taxable account, although it would be possible to hold  a [[Vanguard target retirement funds | Vanguard target retirement fund]] in a portfolio which is entirely taxable, getting the simplicity of management in return for a small tax cost. 

==Advantages==
The most important advantage of a fund of funds is simplicity.  A fund of funds that is a [[Balanced fund|balanced fund]] is normally suitable for your entire portfolio, and requires no management as long as its allocation remains appropriate for you.  With this in mind, Vanguard makes the Vanguard target retirement funds and STAR fund available with a minimum of $1,000, in contrast to the $3,000 required for all other funds.

Funds of funds provide an easy way for a fund company to provide a single, broadly diversified fund without the need for separate management, and make a broadly diversified portfolio available to small investors.  In particular, it is possible to offer a series of funds which hold the same funds in different proportions; the [[Vanguard LifeStrategy funds]] and [[Vanguard target retirement funds]] are examples.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;For a comparison between the Life Strategy Funds and the Target Retirement Funds, refer to [[Vanguard funds: life strategy funds vs target retirement funds]].&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Target date retirement funds]] from other fund companies are also usually funds of funds.

==Disadvantages==

===Possible extra expenses===
Vanguard's funds of funds do not add an extra expense, but some fund companies do charge an expense in addition to the expenses charged by the underlying funds.  To see whether there is such a fee, look at the prospectus; [[acquired fund fees and expenses]] are the expenses charged by the underlying funds, while any other fee is a separate expense charged by the fund of funds.  There is no point in paying such an expense, as the management is not doing anything you could not do easily by yourself; you could hold the underlying funds, [[rebalancing|rebalance]] to the appropriate allocation regularly, and save the fees.

Even with Vanguard, the funds of funds have no lower cost Admiral classes; if your IRA grows large enough for Admiral shares, you may want to switch. (Note that in a corporate retirement plan, you may not have Admiral shares available, or may not even have all the underlying funds available.)  

===Taxes===
A fund of funds must pass on all capital gains distributed by the underlying funds, and cannot use the losses.  It may also have to pay out its own gains when it rebalances, although many funds of funds can use new investments to rebalance and thus avoid distributing gains.  Thus a fund of funds is more likely to distribute capital gains than a balanced fund with similar holdings.

As of 2010, the Regulated Investment Company Modernization Act of 2010&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-111hr4337enr/pdf/BILLS-111hr4337enr.pdf Regulated Investment Company Modernization Act of 2010] (see page 12) &lt;/ref&gt; allows funds of funds to pass on the [[foreign tax credit]] from the individual funds to their shareholders.

[[Exchange-traded funds]] (ETFs) and [[:Mutual fund | mutual funds]] are two different investment products that you can use to hold a diversified portfolio of [[stock basics|stocks]], [[bond]]s or other assets. There is frequent discussion in the [http://www.bogleheads.org/forum/index.php Bogleheads forum] on the comparative merits of each. Below is a comparison of various factors, ordered by approximate importance.

Overall, there is no clear winner: it is up to you to consider the tradeoffs, for example ease of use compared to intraday tradeability, and how applicable they are to your own situation and goals. 

The choice might not be very important. The media and other literature usually presents the contrast as between ETF investing and traditional, high-cost, active mutual funds, which ETFs easily win on cost. If the funds you are considering are all low-cost [[index fund]]s, then you are probably fine either way.

==Expense ratios==
''[[Expense ratios]] (ERs) are annual management expenses. Because they reduce investor returns, ERs are among the most important factors in long-term performance.''

'''ETFs''' generally have the lowest ERs available to small investors.

'''Mutual fund''' expenses can be somewhat higher, with the exception of [[#Vanguard_funds|Vanguard Admiral funds]] which are the same, or slightly higher, than their ETFs. The various fees of ''active'' mutual funds can be ''much'' higher, sometimes outrageous; see [[Mutual funds and fees]] for more details.

Examples:
* VTI (Total stock market ETF): 0.03%, versus VTSAX (Admiral shares fund) at 0.04%.
* SCHZ (U.S. Aggregate Bond Market ETF): 0.04%, versus SWAGX (fund) 0.04%.
* DODGX (large active stock fund): 0.52%.

''Advantage: ETFs or tie.''

==Trading costs==
''These are costs paid once for each trade, whether a sale or a purchase. They are most important for smaller portfolios and frequent investments.''

Most brokerages now allow most '''ETFs''' to trade commission-free.  Some ETFs may incur a small brokerage commission, the same as for stocks, typically in the $5 - $10 range.

ETFs also have a penalty from [[bid/ask spread]]s in the market, typically in the range 0.01% - 0.1% (this varies with fund size and popularity) and a premium or discount to [[net asset value]] (NAV) that can vary from negligible to highly significant. In some illiquid sectors, like [[municipal bonds]], persistent ETF discounts can prevent selling at a fair price for an extended period.&lt;ref name="rick_ferri_bond_etfs"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.rickferri.com/blog/investments/solving-the-bond-etf-discount-problem/| title=Solving The Bond ETF Discount Problem| author=Rick Ferri| author-link=Rick Ferri| date=June 27, 2013| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130804015829/http://www.rickferri.com/blog/investments/solving-the-bond-etf-discount-problem| archive-date=August 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mutual funds''' are more often bought at their originating firm, where they have no commission. If bought at a different brokerage, fees can be much higher, for example $50 per transaction, with some agreements to waive fees from certain fund families. It is very important to select either the account location or the fund to avoid large transaction fees.

Mutual funds always trade at NAV and do not have bid/ask spreads or premium/discounts.

''Advantage: Mutual funds, if bought directly from a fund provider or a brokerage that offers the fund in their "no transaction fee" selection.''

==Trading frequency==
''This refers to possible timing restrictions.''

As of May 28, 2024 both ETFs and mutual funds have the same settlement date of trade date plus one business day (T+1).  Different brokerages and mutual fund custodians have different policies about when proceeds from a sale can be withdrawn. These policies may be related to whether you sold an ETF versus a mutual fund.

'''ETFs''' can be traded at any time during the day, more or less instantaneously. Most mainstream brokerages offer commission-free ETF trading. Check your brokerage's Commission and Fee Schedule for details. For example, consider that [https://www.fidelity.com/bin-public/060_www_fidelity_com/documents/Brokerage_Commissions_Fee_Schedule.pdf Fidelity] may choose to impose a charge service fees on an ETF if the ETF provider does not pay Fidelity a fee for support. Still, ETFs are the vehicle of choice for frequent traders.

'''Mutual funds''' can only be bought at the end of the day.

Mutual funds may have additional fees or restrictions for back-and-forth trades less than a few months apart, including a possible [[redemption fee]] for shares held for shorter than a given period. Because of these restrictions, mutual funds are only suitable for longer term holdings.

''Advantage: ETFs are generally more flexible.''

==Tax efficiency==
''Both kinds of funds sometimes distribute capital gains to holders, and this is undesirable in a taxable account (for stocks, at least). For more details, see [[Principles_of_tax-efficient_fund_placement#Tax_efficiency_of_stocks | Tax efficiency of stocks]].''

'''ETFs''' have an inherent tax efficiency advantage due to their share redemption process (see [[Exchange-traded_fund#Taxes|ETF Taxes]]). Other things equal, you can expect an ETF to distribute lower capital gains than its mutual fund equivalent, often none at all. 

'''Mutual funds''' can only rarely eliminate capital gains in the same fashion. The exception is [[#Vanguard_funds|Vanguard's dual-share fund structure]], which allows their index funds to be just as tax-efficient as ETFs. In addition, index funds in general have very low turnover, limiting the extent of the problem.

''Advantage: ETFs, or tie if Vanguard.''

==Trading mechanics==
''How easy it is to transact either type of fund.''

'''ETFs''' tend to require more attention, because the bid/ask spread and premium/discount factors mentioned in [[#Trading_costs|Trading costs]] can turn highly unfavorable for short intervals. For example, you want to [[Orders#Exchange-traded_funds |use limit orders]] instead of market orders. On the other hand, ETFs provide more sophisticated order options like long term stop-loss orders (the value of which is rather debatable). You can also use covered options with ETFs.

Automatic investments can be problematic with ETFs; this includes things like dividend reinvestment and monthly deposits or withdrawals. Even when the broker offers this functionality for free, the execution price might not be favorable to you.

In addition, buying ETFs usually involves [[#Fractional_shares|share number calculations.]]

'''Mutual funds''' can be bought and sold in a single, friction-less transaction, much like transferring from one bank account to another. They are much more suitable for automatic investment of all kinds.

''Advantage: Mutual funds, for most investors.''

==Availability and portability==
''Access to the two types of fund can vary greatly between accounts. For taxable investments, this can be an important factor if you plan to move assets in the future without incurring tax.''

'''ETFs''' are generally an all-or-none proposition: a brokerage will offer access to ''all'' ETFs in the market. Unless a brokerage option is available (for example, in retirement accounts), you cannot use ETFs. 

It is generally easier to make charitable donations of ETFs in-kind, because the brokerage of the charity should always be able to handle them.

'''Mutual funds''' tend to be more restricted; for example Schwab may offer easy, free access to Schwab funds but make Vanguard funds expensive or not available at all (such as Admiral shares). Charities and other brokers may not be able to receive a particular mutual fund in-kind.

However, Vanguard index funds offer an [[#Vanguard_funds|ETF conversion option]] that solves this problem, for assets held at Vanguard.

''Advantage: ETFs.''

==Intraday pricing==
'''ETFs''' have price and related indicators (like yield) that are constantly updated throughout the trading day. This makes it easier to make accurate decisions about [[rebalancing]] and [[tax loss harvesting]], for example. However, when the market is closed the price is just as opaque; the next day's opening price (at which a market order would be executed) could move up or down an arbitrary amount.

'''Mutual fund''' prices are only updated after the market close, typically 4 pm EST. A workaround for funds that are closely related to certain ETFs is to extrapolate the mutual fund price from the intraday movement of the ETF price. If you want precision, it is best to place the order shortly before the market close to minimize the chance of market shifts during the remainder of the trading day.

''Advantage: ETFs.''

==Fractional shares==
Many brokerages only let you buy '''ETFs''' in whole share amounts. Typically, this results in small amounts of cash left over uninvested, which can be an annoyance. When starting with a dollar amount, you have to calculate the number of shares you can buy before placing an order.

Some brokers let you buy fractional ETF shares. Bear in mind that if you decide to move your account to another broker which does not support fractional shares, you may have to sell your fractional shares and pay a tax on the gain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://finance.zacks.com/can-fractional-shares-purchased-etf-7737.html| title=Can Fractional Shares Be Purchased in an ETF? |date = March 6, 2019|publisher=Zacks|accessdate=September 1, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mutual funds''' can be bought and held in any fractional number. The order can be specified as either dollars or number of shares, and there are no leftover amounts.

''Advantage: Mutual funds.''

==Coverage==
''This is the ability to get the asset classes and strategies you want in either form. Because it can be inconvenient to move money between ETFs and mutual funds, coverage can be a factor even when your initial choices are equally available.''

'''ETFs''' tend to offer the largest asset class selection and granularity in passive form. For example, there are ETFs available for Middle East indexing, or the solar sector, which have corresponding mutual funds.

'''Mutual funds''' offer more strategies, for example active funds, balanced funds or
go-anywhere funds. Of these, balanced funds are the most interesting to passive investors.

''Advantage: Depends on investor goals.''

==Vanguard funds==
Vanguard structures its ETFs as another share class of a mutual fund, like Admiral or Investor shares. This process is unique to Vanguard, protected by a patent until 2023, with two important consequences for the mutual fund investor:
# Tax efficiency: the mutual fund shares benefit from the disposition of capital gains through ETF shares, making Vanguard funds with ETF share classes as efficient as an ETF.
# Conversion: you can convert mutual fund shares to ETF shares without a taxable event. This helps if you transfer assets to another broker, including charitable donations. Conversion in the other direction is not possible.
The second point is an argument to start with mutual fund shares at Vanguard, if unsure. You can always convert to ETF later if needed.

To find out whether a mutual fund has ETF shares, visit the fund page on vanguard.com and look for "Also available as an ETF". Most or all index funds do have ETF shares and benefit from the above considerations. Note that you cannot convert [https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/faqs#conventionalMF a few bond funds] in kind to their ETF shares, but in these cases converting through a normal, taxable transaction will probably not cost much in taxes because of the very limited capital gains of this type of fund.

You can convert by calling Vanguard customer service, or by using Vanguard's [https://personal1.vanguard.com/mec-etf-conversion-webapp/agreement ETF Conversions] online tool.

Vanguard's Admiral shares of index funds generally have the same, or slightly higher expense ratios as the ETF shares, which are themselves competitively priced in the ETF market. Therefore, if Admiral shares are available and you meet the required minimum (usually $3,000), there is no, or only a small, fee advantage for using ETFs.

Some Vanguard funds (and non-Vanguard funds as well) charge '''redemption fees''' to discourage short-term trading or to compensate long-term holders for the expenses caused by short-term trading. Unlike loads or commissions charged by brokers, these fees are paid back to the fund, and so benefit fundholders.

==Types of fees==

===Short-term trading fees===
Vanguard no longer charges short-term trading fees on any of its funds. It used to impose 2% fees on international funds for selling shares held less than two months, and 1% fees on many aggressive and sector funds for selling shares held less than one year. 

These fees were intended to discourage market timers from investing in the funds; high transaction costs might otherwise need to be passed on to shareholders. Vanguard now believes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://personal.vanguard.com/us/insights/article/fund-announcement-05232012| title=More Vanguard funds eliminate or reduce fees| date=May 23, 2012}}{{dead link}}&lt;/ref&gt; that it is right to reject disruptive transactions, and its ban on selling and then buying the same fund online within 30 days are enough to protect long-term investors against trading costs.

===Permanent redemption fees===
A few funds which trade stocks with high trading costs charge a redemption fee on all shares sold, for the same reason that these funds and many other funds charge a [[purchase fee]]; that is, selling stocks causes a significant cost to the fund, and the cost is charged to the investors who are responsible for it. The purchase and redemption fees tend to decrease as the fund becomes larger.

As of May 2024, the following Vanguard funds charge redemption fees:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/mutual-funds/fees| title=Vanguard mutual fund fees and minimums| publisher=Vanguard| accessdate=May 17, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Global ex-U.S. Real Estate Index Fund Admiral Shares (VGRLX) - 0.25%; also 0.25% purchase fee
* Global ex-U.S. Real Estate Index Fund Institutional Shares (VGRNX) - 0.25%; also 0.25% purchase fee
* International Dividend Appreciation Index Fund Admiral Shares (VIAAX)- 0.25%; also 0.25% purchase fee
* International High Dividend Yield Index Fund Admiral Shares (VIHAX) - 0.25%; also 0.25% purchase fee

These funds have an [[ETF]] class, which does not impose redemption fees because the fund does not incur any costs when an investor buys or sells an ETF on the stock market.

==How Vanguard computes the fees==

For funds with non-permanent redemption fees, shares purchased with reinvested distributions are exempt from the fee, and other shares are assumed to be sold on a first-in-first-out basis, even if you use a different accounting method for tax purposes. Therefore, once you have held the fund for longer than the fee period, you can usually rebalance or sell recently purchased shares for tax loss harvesting without paying a fee.

==How to avoid the fees==

If you are considering investing in a fund with a redemption fee for less than the fee period (for example, as a temporary replacement while tax loss harvesting), or with a permanent fee for a short time, use an [[ETF]] instead; the commissions and bid-ask spreads on buying and selling the ETF are likely to be less than the purchase and redemption fee.

If you would have to pay a fee to redeem a fund which has an ETF share class, you can avoid the fee by converting to ETF shares, and then selling the ETF on the stock market. Compare the cost of the conversion, and the commission and spread on the ETF sale, to the redemption fee.

If you are considering a fund with a permanent redemption fee as a long-term investment, you might ignore the potential fee, as the fee is likely to become much lower or go away by the time you actually sell your shares. However, you should also consider the ETF share class, particularly if you do not expect to reach Admiral shares in the fund (or the fund has no Admiral shares) and will thus have higher ongoing costs.

A '''three-fund portfolio''' is a portfolio which uses only basic asset classes &amp;mdash; usually a domestic stock "total market" [[index fund]], an international stock "total market" index fund and a bond "total market" index fund. It is often recommended for and by Bogleheads attracted by "the majesty of simplicity" ([[John Bogle]]'s phrase), and for those who want finer control and better tax-efficiency than they would get in an all-in-one fund like a [[Target date retirement funds | target retirement fund]].

There is no magic in the number three. The phrase is shorthand for a style of portfolio construction that emphasizes simplicity, and is related to [[Lazy_portfolios#Three-fund_lazy_portfolios|lazy portfolios]].

}}
A three-fund portfolio is based on the fundamental asset classes, [[Stock basics |stocks]] and [[Bond basics | bonds]]. It is assumed that [[Money Markets | cash]] is not counted within the investment portfolio, so it is not included. On the other hand, it is assumed that every investor should hold both [[Domestic/International |domestic and international stocks]]. The task, then, is to take these three basic non-cash assets &amp;mdash; domestic stocks, international stocks, and bonds &amp;mdash; decide how much of each to hold (your [[Asset allocation|asset allocation]]). Choose where to hold each of these asset classes, and finally choose a mutual fund to use for each asset class.

===Choosing your asset allocation===
{{Main|Asset allocation}}
{{Notice| '''You must decide for yourself what percentage of stocks to hold''', based in part on your personal risk tolerance. There are no shortcuts and and it needs to be done no matter what investment approach you are using.}}

Even if you are going to use a single Target Retirement fund, you should not take the shortcut implied by the use of a retirement year in the name; you need to decide for yourself what percentage of your portfolio you want to invest in stocks, and choose the fund that matches it. Even if you are going to use a single [[Vanguard funds: life strategy funds vs target retirement funds | LifeStrategy fund]], you need to decide which of them to use, based on the percentage of stocks each you hold.

One traditional rough rule-of-thumb is "age in bonds," or percentage of stocks = 100 - age. This is a conservative rule, and leads to smaller percentages of stocks than Vanguard chooses for [[Vanguard target retirement funds |its Target Retirement series]].

The second decision is what percentage of your stock allocation should be U.S. (domestic) and what should be international. This is a much less critical decision because U.S. and international stocks have similar risk profiles and have similar long-term returns. In 2010, Vanguard increased the international allocation of its Target Retirement and LifeStrategy funds from 20% of the stock allocation to 30%, and increased it again to 40% in 2015.

&lt;!--

Author note -- as of 2023, this Vanguard tool no longer exists.

====Vanguard's tool====
As of 2020, Vanguard provides a tool that recommends a balanced portfolio similar to the kind discussed here (Vanguard recommends a [[Vanguard four fund portfolio|four fund portfolio]]), with percentages based on your responses to a short online questionnaire. The tool is entitled [https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/tools/recommendation?reset=true Get a recommendation to fit your goals]; you can navigate to it by way of Vanguard.com, Go to personal investors' site, What we offer: Mutual Funds, Get a Recommendation.

See [[Asset allocation]] for more details.
--&gt;
===Choosing your asset location===

Since your portfolio may be split between multiple locations (one or more tax-advantaged retirement accounts, and one or more taxable accounts) you should look at [[tax-efficient fund placement]] to determine which funds belong in each account. In general, the international fund should go into a taxable account, the bond fund should go into a tax-advantaged account, and the domestic equity fund should fill in the remaining space.

You may need to hold the same (or equivalent) funds in multiple accounts to have ideal asset allocation and asset location.

===Choosing three funds===

For Bogleheads, the answer for "which mutual funds" to use in a three-fund portfolio is "low-cost funds that represent entire markets." 

If you ask different people to choose funds for a three-fund portfolio, you will get different fund choices. The differences are usually of no fundamental importance, and are usually the result of a) making choices between nearly identical, almost interchangeable funds, and b) simplifying further by using combination package funds. Watch out for high expense ratios, particularly in the bond funds.

====Vanguard funds====

From Vanguard's list of "core funds," the funds that are best for a three-fund portfolio are:

* Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund (VTSAX)
* Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund (VTIAX)
* Vanguard Total Bond Market Fund (VBTLX)

So, a "three-fund portfolio" might consist of 42% Total Stock Market Index, 18% Total International Stock Index, and 40% Total Bond Market fund.

====Other than Vanguard, Boglehead-style====

The building blocks of Boglehead-style investing are low-[[Expense ratios |expense-ratio]] [[Indexing |index]] mutual funds and/or [[Exchange-traded funds |ETFs]]. Vanguard fans would suggest that Vanguard has the best and most complete lineup of such funds, and that the most convenient place to hold Vanguard mutual funds is directly at Vanguard. As a result, the Bogleheads forum and Wiki tends to be Vanguard-oriented. But investing according to the [[Bogleheads investment philosophy | Boglehead philosophy]] certainly does not require you to invest at Vanguard or use Vanguard products. Here are some suggestions on how to do it with other funds. (Refer to the associated wiki article for additional information.)

Some brokerages such as [[Merrill Edge]] do not offer their own family of mutual funds so you will to consider different fund families. First ask your brokerage which mutual funds have no transaction fees. You typically will choose between two options: a) the lowest cost funds like Vanguard's but with a transaction fee, or b) higher cost funds like T. Rowe Price's but with no transaction fee. The best choice depends on how often you buy or sell and how much you invest over time.

====Other considerations====

A total stock market index fund represents the whole market, while an S&amp;P 500 fund does not. Now that total stock market funds exist and have expenses just as low as S&amp;P 500 funds, total stock market funds are preferable. In practice, the importance and magnitude of the difference is a subject of debate. In a 401(k) plan with limited choices you might very well opt for an S&amp;P 500 index fund to serve as the domestic stock component of a three-fund portfolio.

Alternatively, you can [[Approximating total stock market |approximate a Total Stock Market fund]] by combining an S&amp;P 500 index fund with one or more mid-cap and small-cap funds. There are "[[Extended market index fund|completion index]]" funds such as Vanguard's Extended Market fund (available as an open-end fund as VEXAX and as an ETF as VXF) which can be added to an S&amp;P 500 fund in a specified ratio to produce a hybrid which should perform like a Total Stock Market fund.

Vanguard perplexes investors by offering two virtually interchangeable international stock market index funds: Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund (VTIAX) and Vanguard FTSE All-World ex-US (VFWAX). See [[FAQ on Vanguard international funds#Should_I_buy_Total_International_or_FTSE_All-World_ex-US.3F|Should I buy Total International or FTSE All-World ex-US]] for the details.

For Vanguard, be aware of any minimum investment required by each fund; for instance, the Admiral shares of most Vanguard index funds require a minimum investment of $3,000. If you will have difficulty meeting these minimums, you may want to consider an all-in-one single-fund portfolio until you accumulate enough that this is not an issue.

The Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Fund, and those of several other firms, track the Barclay's U.S. Aggregate Index (in Vanguard's case, the Barclay's U.S. Aggregate Float-Adjusted Index). In Barclay's words, this index tracks the "investment grade, US dollar-denominated, fixed-rate taxable bond market." The "bond market" is a somewhat diffuse concept. Some people complain that the Aggregate index is not really the "total" bond market. Barclay's has a broader index, the Barclay's U.S. Universal Index. It includes "USD-denominated, taxable bonds that are rated either investment grade or high-yield." As of 2015, 87% of the Universal index is made up of bonds in the Aggregate index, but the other 13% includes "U.S. Corporate High Yield Index, Investment Grade 144A Index, Eurodollar Index, U.S. Emerging Markets Index, and the non-ERISA eligible portion of the CMBS Index." People who have strong feelings about wanting to be more "total" than the Vanguard Total Bond Index Fund might prefer the Barclay's Universal index. As of 2015, there is at least one product, the iShares Core Total USD Bond Market ETF, IUSB, that tracks the Barclay's Universal index, and with an 0.13% expense ratio, it qualifies as a "low-cost index fund." It could be used as the bond component of a three-fund portfolio.

====Combining domestic and international stocks====

The relative percentage of domestic and international stocks is a subject of intense discussion in the forum. One sensible option is to hold domestic and international stocks in the same proportions as they represent in the total world economy. As of October 2014, that would be about 50% U.S. and 50% international. This option is recommended by Burton Malkiel and Charles Ellis, both of whom have longstanding ties to Vanguard, in their book ''The Elements of Investing''. Other authorities suggest holding less than that, and Vanguard currently allocates 40% of stock to international in its [[Vanguard Target Retirement Funds |Target Retirement funds]], and in their research, advise holding 20-40% international allocations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.vanguard.com/pdf/flgiecr.pdf| title=International Equity: Considerations and Recommendations| publisher=Vanguard Investment Counseling &amp; Research| date=January 2, 2009| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200513135423/https://www.vanguard.com/pdf/flgiecr.pdf| archive-date=May 13, 2020| accessdate=June 5, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; If your own preference is for a "total world" weighting, then the portfolio can obviously be simplified using Vanguard's Total World Stock Index fund, which is exactly what Malkiel and Ellis suggest. Such a two-fund portfolio would use these funds:

* Vanguard Total World Stock Index Fund (VTWSX) for both domestic and international stocks
* Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Fund (VBTLX)

====Combining stocks and bonds====

The Vanguard Balanced Index Fund holds 60% Total Stock Market Index Fund and 40% Total Bond Market Index Fund. By adding an international stock fund, you could create a three-fund portfolio with two funds.

==Adequacy of a three-fund portfolio==

One Marketwatch article&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Jonathan Burton| date=December 5, 2006| url=https://www.marketwatch.com/story/story/print?guid=F047C5E4-3F49-451A-9A69-FD8FBF2D3A15| title=Three mutual funds that end the guesswork| publisher=Market watch| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210224224221/https://www.marketwatch.com/story/these-three-mutual-funds-may-be-all-youll-ever-need| archive-date=June 5, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; quotes various '''non'''-Boglehead commentators as saying such things as "You can make it really simple, be well-diversified, and do better than two-thirds of investors" and "That three-pronged approach is going to beat the vast majority of the individual stock and bond portfolios that most people have at brokerage firms... there is a certain elegance in the simplicity of it."

In her Forbes article, ''"How To Diversify With Just Three Funds"'', Boglehead [[Laura Dogu | Laura F. Dogu]] describes this approach and comments "With only these three funds (Vanguard Total Stock Market Index fund, Vanguard Total International Stock Market Index fund, and the Vanguard Total Bond Market fund), investors can create a low cost, broadly diversified portfolio that is very easy to manage and rebalance.... Some investors may be uncomfortable with holding only three funds and will question whether they are truly diversified. With these three holdings the answer on diversification is a resounding 'YES'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Laura Dogu| date=January 28, 2011 |url=https://blogs.forbes.com/thebogleheadsview/2011/01/28/three-funds-to-own-now| title=How To Diversify With Just Three Funds| publisher=Forbes| accessdate=June 5, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2015 article, ''"The only funds you need in your portfolio now"'', Walter Updegrave commented: "Of course, some advisers will suggest that you're missing out unless you spread your money among all manner of exotic investments (which they're more than happy to sell you). But the more complicated your portfolio is, the more expensive and more prone to blow-ups it is likely to be -- which also increases the odds that it will generate subpar returns," and suggested a "three-fund diversified portfolio: simply invest in the following three funds (or their ETF equivalents): a total U.S. stock market fund, a total international stock market fund and a total U.S bond market fund."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Walter Updegrave| date=December 30, 2014| url=https://money.cnn.com/2014/12/30/retirement/portfolio-funds/| title=The only funds you need in your portfolio now| publisher=CNN Money| accessdate=June 5, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some would argue that a three-fund portfolio is good enough and that there is no real proof that more complicated portfolios are any better. Others would argue that the evidence for superiority of [[Slice and dice|slice and dice]], "[[Value tilting - stock |small value tilting]]," and inclusion of classes like [[REIT]]s is too strong to ignore.

==What about bonds?==

As of 2016 when this is being written, bond interest rates are near historic lows and there is a good deal of buzz to the effect that the "thirty-year bull market in bonds has ended" and that investing strategies that have worked for decades should be changed to reflect new realities. Should the three-fund portfolio be modified? No definitive answer can be given to this controversial question, but we can sketch out some of the prevalent '''and conflicting''' opinions on the matter.

# Some would say that advocates of complex investing strategies '''always''' have reasons why simple approaches "once worked but do not work any more." Advocates of simplicity might say to ignore the noise and continue to stay the course; it may turn out that something else does better--something always does--but that a three-fund portfolio is still good enough.
# In 2013, Vanguard altered the composition of its Target Retirement funds; from 2010 to 2013, most of them were literally three-fund portfolios as described here. Now, the bond portion has been modified to include international bonds; specifically, the bond allocation is now 70% Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Fund and 30% Total International Bond Index Fund. Nothing Vanguard has published would lead you to believe that this is a big change or that it will have a big effect. Some may find it appealing to follow Vanguard's lead.
# Some well-informed Bogleheads make a strong case that the "bond" component of a three-fund portfolio might well be filled with non-[[Certificate_of_deposit#Brokered_CDs|brokered]] bank CDs instead of a traditional bond fund.
# Suggestions 2 and 3 are adjustments that do not radically change the risk of the bond component. For the record, it should be stated that Burton Malkiel and Charles Ellis, in the 2013 edition of their book ''Elements of Investing,'' made a controversial and much more radical suggestion, which shocked many forum members. But, because they were early champions of indexing, each with long associations with Vanguard, their suggestion should be noted. They seemed to be recommending the replacement of a traditional high-grade bond fund with a 50/50 mix of emerging markets bonds and a high-dividend stock fund. Using Vanguard's "risk potential" categories, that means they are recommending replacing a holding in risk potential category 2 with a mix of holdings in categories 3 and 4.

Following the resurgence of inflation in 2021, [[Treasury Inflation Protected Securities]] (TIPS) have now become more popular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://blbarnitz4.wordpress.com/2016/12/04/a-three-fund-portfolio-tailored-for-stable-retirement-spending/#more-4071| title=A Three Fund Portfolio tailored for stable retirement spending| publisher=Bogleheads® blog| accessdate=August 2, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contrasts with other approaches==

There are single, all-in-one, "funds of funds" that are intended to be used as an investor's whole portfolio. Vanguard funds in this category include the Target Retirement funds, the LifeStrategy funds; perhaps the actively-managed Wellington and Wellesley funds would qualify, too.

On the one hand, a three-fund portfolio involves a do-it-yourself aspect that makes it more complicated than using an all-in-one fund. For example, because different assets grow at different rates, any investor who chooses a do-it-yourself approach needs to "[[Rebalancing |rebalance]]" occasionally &amp;mdash; perhaps annually &amp;mdash; in order to maintain the desired percentage mix. 

On the other hand, three-fund portfolios are simpler than the genres called "Coffeehouse portfolios" ([[Bill Schultheis |William Schultheis's]] term), "couch potato" portfolios, or "[[Lazy portfolios |lazy portfolios]]," which are intended to be easy for do-it-yourselfers but are nevertheless slice-and-dice portfolios using six or more funds.

==The LifeStrategy and Target Retirement funds are four-fund portfolios==
{{Main|Vanguard four fund portfolio}}

The Vanguard Target Retirement funds and LifeStrategy funds use a four fund allocation.&lt;ref group="note"&gt; The Vanguard Target Retirement Income fund, and Target funds nearing target dates add a fifth fund, the Vanguard Short Term Inflation Indexed Bond Fund, to the allocation. &lt;/ref&gt; The funds include:

*Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund
*Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund
*Vanguard Total Bond Market II Index Fund
*Vanguard Total International Bond Index Fund

Some see advantages in holding a do-it-yourself four-fund portfolio rather than a LifeStrategy fund or Target Retirement fund, even if the same four funds are used. The advantages are small but meaningful to some, and include:

* Improved tax efficiency for taxable investors by placing each fund in its best location
* Direct control over allocation percentages
* Independence from Vanguard's small course changes in the Target Retirement funds (as when they increased stock allocation in 2006, and changed domestic-to-international ratio in 2010, and added international bonds in 2013)
* Availability of slightly-lower-cost Admiral shares in the individual funds, but not the Target Retirement or LifeStrategy funds

==Lazy portfolios==
{{main|Lazy portfolios}}

Lazy portfolios are ''specific'' portfolio suggestions, designed to perform well in most market conditions. Most contain a small number of low-cost funds that are easy to rebalance. They are "lazy" in that the investor can maintain the same asset allocation for an extended period of time, as they generally contain 30-40% bonds, suitable for most pre-retirement investors.

The term has been popularized by Paul B. Farrell, who writes MarketWatch columns about various simple portfolios. Instead of going through the step of deciding on your own asset allocation, you accept the suggestion that, say, 2/3 stocks to 1/3 bonds and half-and-half domestic and international is a good enough, one-size-fits-all allocation.

==Other variations==
{{See also|Variations on Bogleheads® investing}}

A three-fund combination can serve as the core of a more complex portfolio, where you add a small [[Variations on Bogleheads® investing#Having a play money account|play money allocation]] or a [[Tilt|tilt]] to some corner of the market that interests you.

==Historic notes==

* Scott Burns wrote a 1991 article, "Exactly How To Be A Couch Potato Portfolio Manager". The original "basic, humble, couch potato portfolio" consisted of two funds, "the Vanguard Index 500 fund, which mimics the S&amp;P 500 index, and the Vanguard Fixed Income Short Term Government Bond Fund."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Scott Burns| date=October 1, 1991| url=https://assetbuilder.com/knowledge-center/articles/scott-burns/exactly_how_to_be_a_couch_potato_portfolio_manager| title=Exactly How To Be A Couch Potato Portfolio Manager| publisher=Asset Builder| url-access=limited}} (limited access)&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Taylor Larimore]] was an early advocate of this approach, which he described in 1999 in a Morningstar posting, "[https://web.archive.org/web/20210307193847/http://socialize.morningstar.com/NewSocialize/ViewPost.aspx?apptype=0&amp;PostID=17632 Which is better, 15 funds or 4?]" He stated that "It is no longer necessary to own large portfolios. Now, with only four funds, it is possible to own all the securities in every asset-class, style, and cap-size, in exact proportion to their market weight.

The annual '''expense ratio''' is a fund's recurring management fees as a percentage of a its assets. It shows what it costs the investment firm to operate the fund.

The expense ratio represents the percentage of the fund's assets that go purely toward the expense of the daily operation of the fund. It is taken out of the fund's assets, which lowers the return to investors. An expense ratio of 0.5% means that each year 0.5% of the fund's total assets are used to cover expenses. 

{{Notice|The expense ratio does not include brokerage costs a mutual fund incurs when purchasing and redeeming securities, nor does it include any [[Mutual funds and fees#Loads|sales charges]] (front-end loads or deferred sales charges) associated with buying and selling the fund.}}

The major parts of the expense ratio are the management fee and the administrative cost. In the US, some funds also charge an additional fee, known as 12b-1, to cover marketing and distribution costs.

:'''The investment advisory fee''' or management fee is the money used to pay the manager of the mutual fund.

:'''Administrative costs''' are the costs of recordkeeping, mailings, maintaining a customer service line, etc. These are costs that all funds have, but they vary in size from fund to fund.

:'''Some funds also charge a 12b-1 fee'''. The 12b-1 fee gets its name from the section in the [[wikipedia:Investment Company Act of 1940|Investment Company Act of 1940]] that allows a mutual fund to pay distribution and marketing expenses out of the fund's assets. The original intent of a 12b-1 fee was to help market the mutual fund so that its assets would increase. Funds have also used 12b-1 fees as a hidden way to pay brokers for using the fund. The SEC has limited the 12b-1 fee to 1% annually with maximum of 0.25% going to brokers. No-load fund families often use the 12b-1 fee (0.25%) to purchase "shelf space" on a brokerage's mutual fund "supermarket" platform. The platform then sells these funds as "no transaction fee" funds, but sells no-load funds not paying the fee with an added sales purchase fee.

There are different kinds of expense ratios that you should watch out for. 
:'''Prospectus Gross Expense Ratio''' - Gross Expense Ratio represents the total gross expenses divided by the fund's average net assets. In some instances, a mutual fund might "waive" a portion of its costs. Some fee waivers have an expiration date; other waivers are in place indefinitely. If the gross expense ratio is not equal to the net expense ratio, the gross expense ratio portrays the fund's expenses had the fund not waived a portion, or all, of its fees. As a result, it is to some degree an indication of fee contracts.

:'''Prospectus Net Expense Ratio''' - The percentage of fund assets used to pay for operating expenses and management fees, including 12b-1 fees, administrative fees, and all other asset-based costs incurred by the fund. The fund's [[NAV]] reflects fund expenses.&lt;ref group="note"&gt; Some mutual funds, known as [[Fund of funds |fund of funds]], hold mutual funds as the portfolio investment. Since January 2007 a fund of funds is required to report an '''Acquired Fund Fee''' that shows the operating expenses of the underlying funds. The expense ratio for a fund of funds will include this acquired fund fee plus any additional management fees the fund incurs.&lt;/ref&gt;

:'''Audited Net Expense Ratio''' - This expense ratio is pulled directly from the fund's annual report. It reflects the percentage of fund assets paid for operating expenses and management fees, including 12b-1 fees, administrative fees, and all other asset-based costs incurred by the fund. Fund expenses are reflected in the fund's NAV.

The table below shows where to look for the different expense ratios.

Expense ratios found on websites usually include management fees, administrative fees, marketing and distribution fees, operating costs, and all other asset-based costs incurred by the fund. However, you should check the website definitions to be sure.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Definitions from Morningstar are [http://www.morningstar.com/InvGlossary/expense_ratio.aspx here]; Vanguard's are [https://personal.vanguard.com/us/glossary/e/GlossaryExpenseRatioContent.jsp here]&lt;/ref&gt; It is sometimes referred to as a Total Expense Ratio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.etf.com/sections/blog/23937-etfs-made-easy-expense-ratios.html?nopaging=1| title=ETFs Made Easy: Expense Ratios| author=Dave Nadig| publisher=ETF.com| date=December 1, 2014| accessdate=August 15, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The expense ratio familiar to American investors has different names in other countries. For example:
*'''Canada''': The expense ratio is known as the [[finiki:Management expense ratio|'Management Expense Ratio (MER)']].
*'''Europe and the UK''': The expense ratio is known as the 'Ongoing Charges Figure (OCF)' or the 'Total Expense Ratio (TER)'.
*'''Australia''': The expense ratio is known as 'Management Costs'.

== Blended expense ratio ==
To calculate a blended expense ratio across a portfolio, calculate the expenses for each fund, sum the expenses, and then divide that sum by your total balance, as shown below:

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center"
|+ Blended investment portfolio expense ratio
! scope="col" width="20%"|Fund

|-
| Fund C||$3,000.00||0.33%||$9.90

| Total||$8,000.00||0.41%||$32.40
|} {{spreadsheet|key=0AueLhNpKZa4XdHJGS0otdF9ycHJ1TFpxV3hhdXhVYVE}}
In the example above, the blended expense ratio of 0.41% is calculated by dividing $32.40 (the sum of the expenses) by $8,000 (the sum of the balances).

'''{{PAGENAME}}s''' are registered investment companies that pool investors' capital to invest in securities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://investor.gov/investing-basics/investment-products/mutual-funds| title=Mutual Funds| publisher=Investor.gov (SEC)| accessdate=June 5, 2023}} &lt;/ref&gt; Professional money managers manage mutual funds, and the corporate contributory retirement system in the U.S. uses them extensively. As of 2025, a total of 8,355 U.S. mutual funds held over 28.5 trillion dollars of assets, owned by fifty-six percent of American households and an estimated 126.8 million individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.icifactbook.org/pdf/2025-factbook.pdf| title=2025 ICI Fact Book| publisher=Investment Company Institute| accessdate=July 7, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mutual funds offer you diversification, professional management, liquidity, and convenience. These advantages are offset by factors such as costs, fund turnover, and the consequences of organizational structure. You can buy mutual funds through [[broker]]s with commissions, or through firms that sell directly to investors without commissions. Funds may be actively managed, or they may use passive indexing. Funds give you access to [[money markets]], [[Developed market bonds|domestic and international bonds]], and [[Domestic/International|domestic and international stocks]]. 

==Mutual fund advantages==

Mutual funds have a number of compelling advantages.

*'''Diversification'''. The first principle of mutual fund investing is broad diversification of securities. Diversification greatly reduces and can even eliminate the risks of owning just a few individual stocks and bonds. Before the advent of mutual funds it was impossible for ordinary investors to own enough securities to minimize non-market risk. Now, even a beginning investor with $1,000 can invest in a mutual fund holding thousands of individual securities, so that the decline or bankruptcy of a single security will have almost no influence on their portfolio.&lt;ref name="bogle_on_mutual_funds"&gt;{{cite book| title=Bogle on Mutual Funds: New Perspectives for the Intelligent Investor| publisher=McGraw-Hill| date=1993| isbn=1-55623-860-6| author=John Bogle| author-link=John Bogle| pages=52-54}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Professional management'''. Managing and holding an investment portfolio means selecting and supervising the fund's holdings. Managers must do this based on the fund's objectives and policies. Index fund managers aim to mimic their benchmark index, and make no attempt to select "winning" securities. By contrast, active fund managers try to add value by selecting securities they think will perform above the average, within the fund's objectives.&lt;ref name="bogle_on_mutual_funds" /&gt;
*'''Liquidity'''. Many securities (hedge funds, limited partnerships, real estate, CDs, etc.) cannot be sold quickly and without penalty. However, you can acquire or sell most mutual fund shares at a moment's notice, at the fund's next determined [[net asset value]] per share. Also, you can easily convert mutual funds into cash at a fraction of the cost (a few funds have redemption fees) that you would pay to sell individual stocks or bonds. This is also true when exchanging mutual funds.&lt;ref name="bogle_on_mutual_funds" /&gt;
*'''Convenience'''. Mutual fund prices and performance are readily available in newspapers, magazines, internet and research organizations such as Morningstar. You can purchase them through brokers or directly with fund companies. Mutual fund companies provide automatic reinvestment of dividends and capital gains distributions, tax reporting, programs for regular additional investments and for systematic withdrawals, check writing on money market funds, telephone exchanges among different funds within the same family, and on-line account management.&lt;ref name="bogle_on_mutual_funds" /&gt;

==Mutual fund criticism==
{{Main|Mutual funds and fees}}
{{Quote
|quote = '''Invest in nonprofit index funds'''. Swensen says individuals should invest in nonprofit funds that track market segments, such as the [[S&amp;P 500 index|S&amp;P 500]]. There are a range of index funds that track the U.S. domestic stock market, international markets, emerging markets and the real-estate market. Swensen says mutual funds that are organized on a not-for-profit basis don't have the same conflict of interest as for-profit funds, and they charge lower fees. The fees are even lower with nonprofit index funds, because you're not paying money managers to research stocks and buy and sell them. The fund simply holds all the stocks listed in that index. And because well-structured index funds have low churn (turnover), they are remarkably tax efficient.
|source = &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;—{{cite web| url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6203264| author=David Swenson| publisher=NPR| title=Yale's Money Guru Shares Wisdom with Masses| date=October 5, 2006}} 
}}
According to critics, high costs, and conflicts of interest between the managers of the funds and the investor, often negate the advantages of mutual funds.

*'''Costs'''. Experts such as [[John Bogle]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://boglecenter.net/wp-content/uploads/FAJ-Relentless-Rules-11-05.pdf| title=The Relentless Rules of Humble Arithmetic| author=John Bogle| author-link=John Bogle| publisher=Financial Analysts Journal| date=2005| accessdate=June 5, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; and David Swenson&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6203264| author=David Swenson| publisher=NPR| title=Yale's Money Guru Shares Wisdom with Masses| date=October 5, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; criticise the costs of mutual fund investing. According to the [https://www.ici.org/ Investment Company Institute], the average [[Expense ratios |expense ratio]] for US stock mutual funds in 2014 was 1.33% (weighted average 0.70%), while the average expense ratio for US bond mutual funds was 0.98% (weighted average 0.57%).&lt;ref name="ici2015_ch5"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.ici.org/pdf/2015_factbook.pdf| title=ICI 2015 Mutual Fund Fact Book (chapter five)| publisher=Investment Company Institute| accessdate=June 5, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to John Bogle, while mutual fund assets rose 1,600-fold from 1950-2004, mutual fund expenses rose 2,400 fold.&lt;ref name="bogle_battle"&gt;{{cite book| author=John Bogle| author-link=John Bogle| date=2005| title=The Battle for the Soul of Capitalism| publisher=Yale University Press| pages=154,184| isbn=0-300-10990-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; These costs directly reduce investor returns. The expense ratio does not include sales loads or fund [[Mutual funds: additional costs#Transaction Costs |transaction costs]]. 
*'''Turnover'''. John Bogle points out that from 1945 to 1965, stock mutual funds maintained an average turnover of 17 percent (an average holding period of six years). Since 1965, turnover has increased to a present day average of 100 percent (average holding period of one year).&lt;ref name="bogle_battle" /&gt; Increased turnover to these levels creates greater frictional transaction costs for a fund, and also increases the likelihood of realized taxable gains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://boglecenter.net/wp-content/uploads/JCB_AAII0505.pdf| title=The Arithmetic of Mutual Fund Investing is More Important Than Ever| author=John Bogle| author-link=John Bogle| publisher=American Association of Individual Investor, Philadelphia Chapter| date=May 24, 2005| accessdate=June 5, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Organizational structure'''. According to critics, the [[Mutual fund structure | basic structure]] of the mutual fund, where an external management company owns the mutual fund is inherently riddled with conflicts of interest. The external management company's profits to its shareholders must come from mutual fund shareholders. In 2006, the top thirty mutual fund management companies had a corporate structure breakdown that consisted of nineteen large conglomerates; seven publicly owned firms; and four privately held firms. In addition, fund acquisitions and mergers have produced little realized value for fund shareholders. Luo and Qiao (2013) find that "acquiring families keep most of the acquired funds intact, and merge a small fraction of the acquired funds with a few of their incumbent funds. Most involved funds, including the acquired funds and the incumbent funds that remain intact, have a performance deterioration. There is little evidence that fund expenses decrease or fund liquidity increases."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author1=Jiang Luo| author2=Zheng Qiao| url=https://ssrn.com/abstract=2251726| title=On the Mergers and Acquisitions of Mutual Fund Families: The Determinants and Subsequent Impact on Fund Performance| date=April 9, 2013}}{{dead link}} Available at SSRN.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of mutual funds==
Mutual funds give you access to diversified portfolios of the major asset classes: [[Money markets|money markets]], [[Bond basics|bonds]], and [[Stock basics|stocks]], as well as access to discrete market segments of each market.

Funds may be actively managed, where the investment manager tries to outperform a benchmark index, or indexed, where the investment manager aims to match a benchmark index return. Mutual funds may or may not have a sales commission.

===Load funds===
{{Main|Mutual funds and fees}}
Mutual funds sold by full service brokerages, banks, and commissioned advisors usually impose a sales charge on investors known as a "sales load". You might pay the sales load upfront upon purchase, or deferred until you sell fund shares; this deferred charge is often called a "contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC)". These sales charges are on top of the fund's expense ratio, and any other transaction charges the fund may impose. Different share classes usually indicate sales charges, as follows:

*'''A-shares'''. A-shares have a front end charge on initial investment. A fund issuing A-shares might have a 5% load upon purchase, so that if you commit $10,000 to the fund, you would actually invest $9,500 in the fund, with $500 going to the sales agent as a commissioned load. A-shares may also have an additional 0.25% annual charge (known as a 12b-1 fee).
*'''B-shares'''. B-shares do not charge an upfront load. Instead the shares impose a back end redemption fee combined with a 1% annual charge (12b-1 fee). The redemption fee usually declines each year until it eventually reaches zero. The combination of the annual charge and the redemption fee assures that the full load is eventually paid. The fund's prospectus will show the exact rate at which these fees will decline. Ordinarily, B-shares convert to A-shares (and reduced 12b-1 charges) once the CDSC reaches zero.
*'''C-shares'''. C-shares do not charge an upfront load. C-shares are sold with a 1% CDSC for the first year, plus a 1% 12b-1 fee. The redemption fee is eliminated during year two. Unlike B-shares, C-shares never convert to A-shares; holders pay the added 1% 12b-1 fee for as long as they hold the fund.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.sec.gov/about/reports-publications/investor-publications/introduction-mutual-funds | title=Mutual Funds and Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) – A Guide for Investors| publisher=SEC| accessdate=June 5, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===No-load funds===

A no-load mutual fund distributes its fund shares directly with an investor. Thus a no-load mutual fund does not employ the sales charge fees that load funds impose on shareholders. This is a distinct advantage for the do-it-yourself investor. 

However a no-load fund may impose the following fees, on top of the expense ratio that all funds have:
*'''Transaction fees'''. Mutual funds incur costs buying and selling securities for the fund; for more, see: [[Mutual funds: additional costs]]. Some funds cover the costs associated with an individual investor’s transactions by charging [[Purchase fee|purchase fees]] and [[Redemption fee |redemption fees]] directly to the investor at the time of the transactions to cover these costs. Unlike sales charges, these fees are usually paid back into the fund. Funds may also charge a redemption fee to deter short term market timing selling of the fund.
*'''Maintenance fees'''. Some funds may charge a separate maintenance fee for low balance fund accounts.
* '''12b-1 fees'''. A no-load fund is permitted to charge a maximum 0.25% 12b-1 fee and still remain classified as a no-load fund. The main reason that a fund might impose a 0.25% is for purchasing access to a brokerage firm's "fund supermarket". The fee allows the brokerage to offer the fund as a "No Transaction Fee" fund in the supermarket.

===Mutual fund categories===
====Money market funds====
{{Main|Money markets}}
{{Quote
|quote = Money funds are regulated under [https://www.law.uc.edu/CCL/InvCoRls/rule2a-7.html Rule 2a-7] of the [[wikipedia:Investment Company Act of 1940|Investment Company Act of 1940]]. Key provisions of the regulations require the following:

* '''Maturity'''. Money funds can only invest in money market instruments maturing under 12 months, and must maintain a weighted average maturity of 60 days or less.
* '''Diversification'''. With the exception of federal government securities, money funds may not invest more than 5 percent of their assets in a single issuer.
* '''Credit Quality'''. Money funds must limit their investments to securities that are rated in one of the two highest short-term rating categories by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization (NRSRO). Investment in second-tier securities is limited to 3% of total fund assets, with a limit of 0.5% for any single issuer. Investment in second tier securities is restricted to maturities of 45 days or less.

Under the 2014 [https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2014/08/14/2014-17747/money-market-fund-reform-amendments-to-form-pf#h-186 SEC final rules], money funds are divided into three classes: institutional, retail, and government. Institutional money funds must have a floating NAV based on market values. The rules also provide for liquidity (redemption) fees and gates (suspended redemption) during periods of market distress. In summary:

* A fund may impose a fee of up to 2% on redemptions if the fund's weekly liquid assets fall below 30% of its total assets.
* A fund must impose a 1% fee on redemptions (with the option of imposing a fee of up to 2%) if the fund's weekly liquid assets fall below 10% of its total assets—unless the fund's board determines a fee would not be in the fund's best interest.
* A fund may impose a gate—that is, suspend redemptions—for up to 10 business days in a 90-day period.
* The fees and gates rules only apply to retail and institutional funds, although government funds may voluntarily adopt them if the fees and gates are previously disclosed to investors.

Money market funds are mutual funds that invest in short term (less than one year) money market instruments. [[Money markets#Marketable money market instruments|Money market fund investments]] include treasury bills, commercial paper, bank CDs and banker's acceptances. By design, they are meant to maintain stable net asset valuations of 1.00 dollar per share, and provide investors with interest dividends. They are therefore suitable investments for savings and other short term needs.

Although money market funds are low risk, they are not zero-risk. If some of the underlying investments default, the fund may not be able to maintain a [[Net asset value|net asset value]] of $1.00/share; this failure is colloquially known as ''breaking the buck''. As of November, 2009, there have been only a [[The 2008 money market crisis |few cases]] when this has actually happened. Most notably, two money-market funds of The Reserve Funds ''broke the buck'' in September, 2008, after Lehman went bankrupt.

Money funds are characterized by the underlying investments comprising the portfolio. This specialization allows funds to differentiate by risk and tax characteristics. Money funds include:

* '''General (Prime) money funds'''. These funds invest in a large range of money fund instruments: [[Treasury bill|treasury bills]], CDs, Yankee CDs, Eurodollar CDs, [[Commercial paper|commercial paper]], and [[Banker's acceptance|banker's acceptances]]. These funds are usually heavily weighted towards the non-treasury instruments. Since these instruments are exposed to credit risks, they provide higher interest coupons than treasuries (this excess interest can be called the default risk premium). The non-treasury component of a General money market fund is taxable income at both federal and state levels.
* '''Treasury money funds'''. Treasury money funds invest 100% in "full faith and credit" treasury bills and agency instruments. As a result, they are not subject to credit risk (because the treasury has monopoly power to print fiat currency). Treasury interest is exempt from state income taxation.
* '''Tax-exempt funds'''. These funds invest in municipal money market instruments. The interest is generally exempt from federal taxation (although some interest may be subject to the [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/alternativeminimumtax.asp alternative minimum tax]). State specific tax exempt funds invest in municipal securities of an individual state and so provide federal, state, and sometimes local tax exempt interest for state residents. Tax exempt funds are subject to credit risk as well as the risk of tax law change to their exemption status.

If you hold these in a taxable account, you need to compare the after tax yields of a given money fund to determine whether the fund will yield the highest after tax income. For more, see: [[Money markets#After-tax yields |After-tax yields]].

Costs are an important factor in money market fund selection. Because the total return of a money market fund is the income payment, the lower the expense ratio of the fund, the higher your net return. A low cost money fund can hold the highest quality money market instruments and still provide competitive yields.

====Bond funds====
{{Main|Bond basics}}
Bond mutual funds invest in fixed income securities with maturities ranging from one year to thirty (or more) years. Bond funds may hold the following [[Bond basics#Types of bonds |types of bonds]]:
*Government bonds
*Corporate bonds
*Asset-backed securities
*Foreign bonds
*Tax-exempt bonds
Each of these general bond categories contain discrete segments of the bond market. Bond funds may hold an aggregate of the taxable or tax exempt bond markets, or they may hold just a specific segment of the market. The following table outlines the segments of the bond market.

Bond funds distinguish by the types of bonds held in the portfolio, the [[Wikipedia:Bond credit rating|credit quality]] of the bonds, and by the [[Bonds: advanced topics#Duration | average maturity]] of the bond portfolio. As a general rule, lower quality and longer maturity bonds provide higher interest coupons, to compensate for the added [[Bond basics#risks |risk]]. Treasury securities have the highest credit quality. Corporate, asset-backed, and tax-exempt bonds are subject to various default and other risks and are rated by rating agencies for credit worthiness. Ratings range from investment grade (the highest rating) to bonds in default.

[[File:Morningstarfixedstylebox.GIF|200px|thumb|Figure 1. Morningstar Fixed Income Style Box. Maturity along x-axis; credit quality on y-axis.]]
Typically, a bond fund in any given segment of the market will be a part of a series of funds providing short, intermediate, and long term maturities. These tiered maturity portfolios allow you to match a bond fund to an expected holding period, and to maintain your portfolio's exposure to interest rate risk. You can usually find bond funds with the following maturities:

*'''Short term bond funds'''. Maturities between 1 year and 5 years.
*'''Intermediate term bond funds'''. Maturities between 5 years and 10 years.
*'''Long term bond funds'''. Maturities greater than 10 years.

A fund will have an average maturity based on the proportion of fund assets represented by each bond held in the portfolio.

The two main risk characteristics of a bond fund, credit quality and maturity, are often graphically presented in a Morningstar style box. See Figure 1 for an example.

Because bond funds distribute income, taxable bonds are often candidates for placement in tax advantaged accounts (see [[Tax-efficient fund placement]]). For taxable accounts, some bonds have tax preferences. Treasury securities are generally exempt from state income tax. Tax exempt bonds are generally exempt from federal taxation and, to the extent that the bond is issued by your state of residence, may also be exempt from state and local taxation (although some interest may be subject to the [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/alternativeminimumtax.asp alternative minimum tax]). These tax preferences often result in lower yields for treasury and municipal bonds in comparison to corporate and other non-preference bonds. You need to compare the after tax yields of a given fund to determine whether the fund will yield the highest after tax income (see: [[Money markets#After-tax yields |After-tax yields]]).

Costs are a critical factor in long term bond fund performance. A low cost bond fund can hold higher quality, less risky bonds and still provide higher long term returns than many higher cost funds holding lower quality bonds.

====Stock funds====
{{Main|Stock basics}}
Stock mutual funds are extremely diverse. There are funds that invest in the American stock markets, funds that invest in [[Domestic/International |international markets]], and funds that invest [[S&amp;P Global Broad Market Index |globally]]. Within each market, there are funds that invest in the entire market, funds that invest in specific segments of the market, and funds that specialize in [[Stock basics#Sector | specific industry sectors]] of the market.

Stocks funds are often classified by the average size of the companies they hold as investments. This is most commonly done by looking at the market capitalization of a firm. [[Market capitalization]] is simply a measurement found by taking a stock's current share price and multiplying it by the number of stock shares outstanding.

[[File:Morningstarequitystylebox.GIF|200px|thumb|Figure 2. Morningstar Equity Style Box. Style along x-axis; Market Capitalization along y-axis.]]
Exact market cap ranges will vary among different financial and rating institutions, but there are three common terms that describe stocks by their general size. 

*'''Large capitalization stocks''':&lt;br&gt;Large cap stocks have a market cap over $10 billion dollars.
*'''Mid capitalization stocks''':&lt;br&gt;Mid cap stocks have a market cap between $2 billion and $10 billion dollars.
*'''Small capitalization stocks''':&lt;br&gt;Small cap stocks have a market cap between $300 million and $2 billion dollars.

While these are the most common market cap references, there are also some less common ones: mega cap (greater than $200 billion); micro cap (between $50 million and $300 million); and nano cap (below $50 million). Market cap terms are relative and change constantly as companies get bigger and smaller.

Stock funds may also be classified by "style," either Growth, Value, or Blend. Growth stock funds invest in companies that are growing their profits at a very fast rate and are expected to continue to grow at an increasing rate. Value stock funds hold stocks that tend to trade at deep discount relative to their intrinsic value (as defined by profits, book value and other measures). Blend funds tend to hold a mixture of growth and value stocks.

The combination of size and style metrics allows a fund to be classified in a Morningstar Equity style box (see Figure 2).

As well as size and style classifications, some international stock funds are specialized by regions. The most common regional fund classifications are:
*European
*Pacific
*Emerging markets

International Developed Market funds usually combine the European and Pacific regions.

====Balanced funds====
{{Main|Balanced fund}}
Balanced funds (sometimes also referred to as hybrid funds) invest in a portfolio that includes stocks and bonds, and sometimes cash and commodities. Usually these type funds have a fixed asset allocation mix, generally with moderate (60 percent stock/40 percent bond) or conservative (40 percent stock/60 percent bond) equity allocations. Balanced funds also include the following types of funds:

*'''Asset allocation funds'''. These funds can be designed to hold a fixed asset allocation of asset classes, but are commonly funds which allow a fund manager to shift allocations according to a [[tactical asset allocation]] strategy.
*'''Life cycle funds'''. These funds usually offer portfolios that hold a static asset allocation, usually labeled as growth, moderate, conservative, and income portfolios. They are often designed as fund of funds (see [[#Fund of funds|below]]).
*'''Target retirement funds'''. These funds are designed primarily for retirement plans. They are usually designed as fund of funds (see [[#Fund of funds|below]]).

Balanced funds offer the advantage of a simplified investment program. The portfolios include multiple asset classes and are self-balancing. However, investors whose portfolios are divided between taxable accounts and tax deferred/tax free accounts often deliberately avoid balanced funds in favor of separate asset class funds, allocated across accounts using [[tax-efficient fund placement]].

====Fund of funds====
{{Main|Fund of funds}}
A fund of funds differs from most mutual funds, in that the fund invests in mutual funds rather than individual securities. Fund of funds are primarily designed for [[:Category:Retirement planning | retirement plans]] and [[:Category:Education savings | education savings plans]]. Fund of funds have two basic forms:
*'''Static portfolios'''. These portfolios hold a steady predetermined allocation mix of stock funds, bond funds, or a balanced mix of stock and bond funds. A variation on this type fund allows a manager to shift the stock/bond/cash allocation according to a [[tactical asset allocation]] strategy.
*'''Target date portfolios'''. These fund of funds hold a targeted asset allocation that [[Glide paths | grows more heavily weighted towards bonds]] as the target date (for retirement or entry into college) approaches. These [[Target date retirement funds | funds]] are commonly used in [[Employer retirement plans overview | corporate retirement plans]] and in the [[529 plans | 529 plan]] market.

Fund of funds may use funds from the same advisory firm, or the fund manager (usually with an added management fee) may select funds from different advisors.

Fund of funds have what is known as an [[Acquired fund fees and expenses | ''acquired fund fee'']], a measure which includes the weighted expense ratio of the underlying funds as well as any additional expense ratio imposed by the investment manager.

====Index funds====
{{Main|Indexing}}
Indexing is an investment management strategy that aims to replicate the investment performance of a market index. An index is a statistical measure of a market's value and performance and serves as a benchmark against which an investment manager's performance is judged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Rick Ferri| author-link=Rick Ferri| title=All About Index Funds: The Easy Way to Get Started| isbn=978-0-07-148492-3| pages=10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, a large number of [[Stock market indexing |index providers]], including S&amp;P, Dow Jones, MSCI, Russell, FTSE, CRSP and Morningstar, provide a wide range of indexes covering [[Stock basics| US]] and [[Domestic/International | international]] stocks, [[Bond basics| bonds]], and [[commodities]]. A well managed, low cost index fund is an excellent, if not optimal, investment vehicle for investing in the overall stock market, in discrete market segments, in the bond markets, and in the commodity markets.

Advantages:
[[Image:Highcost-lowcost.jpg|thumb|Figure 3. Investment growth of both a low-cost and high-cost fund&lt;ref group="note"&gt;
Both funds assume an initial $10,000 investment and an identical 8% annual growth. The time period is 30 years.
The low-cost fund is no-load and has expenses of 0.2% per year.
The high-cost fund has an initial 5.75% sales load, expenses of 2.0% per year, and a 0.25% 12b-1 fee.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

*'''Low costs'''. According to the [https://www.ici.org/ Investment Company Institute], the average expense ratio for US stock mutual funds in 2014 was 1.33% (weighted average 0.70%), while the average expense ratio for US bond mutual funds was 0.98% (weighted average 0.57%).&lt;ref name="ici2015_ch5" /&gt; Index funds are available to investors for expense ratios of 0.20% and lower from firms such as [[Vanguard]], [[Fidelity]], [[Schwab]], and many [[Exchange-traded funds|exchange-traded funds]]. These low expenses mean that a greater portion of market returns accrue to the mutual fund shareholder where they can continue to compound, as opposed to being siphoned off through intermediaries. As Figure 3 demonstrates, indexing's cost advantage builds steadily over long holding periods. In addition to low expense ratios, index funds can provide low transaction costs, which include brokerage commission costs, [[bid/ask spread]]s, and market impact costs (institutional purchases and sales can drive the price of a security up or down before the order is filled.) 
*'''Tax efficiency'''. Because of lower fund turnover and longer holding periods, stock index funds tend to be more tax efficient than actively managed stock funds. This is especially true for total market index funds, large cap index funds, and large growth index funds. These funds rarely realize and distribute a capital gain (and any small capital gains distributions are usually long term gains taxed at reduced tax rates.) Deferring capital gains tax liabilities means higher after tax returns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.ifa.com/Media/Images/PDF%20files/IsYourAlphaBigEnough.pdf| author1=Robert H. Jeffrey| author2=Robert D. Arnott| title=Is Your Alpha Big Enough To Cover Its Taxes?| date=1993| publisher=First Quadrant Corporation| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221102032136/https://www.ifa.com/media/images/pdf%20files/isyouralphabigenough.pdf| archive-date=November 2, 2022| accessdate=June 3, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, since the introduction of the tax regime for [[Qualified dividend | qualified dividends]] in 2004, well-managed total market and large cap indexes have been able to provide investors with 100% qualified dividends, taxed at lower tax rates
*'''Asset class style consistency'''. Index funds are designed to provide the returns of the asset class they are tracking. This allows an investor to control the asset allocation decision.
*'''Reduced manager risk'''. Actively managed funds expose investors to two manager risks.
** The risk that the manager will under perform the benchmark return,
** The risk that the manager will leave the fund. For taxable investors, selling a fund after a manager change could result in a large capital gains tax.
*Index funds greatly reduce these manager risks.
** The risk of under performing a benchmark return is lower (although not eliminated, due to sampling and tracking errors.)
** An investment team manages index funds. One fund manager leaving does not materially affect the management of the fund.
*'''Simplicity'''. The low cost, high tax efficiency, and long term consistency of performance advantages of indexing all help to simplify how you select and monitor funds for your investment plan.

The cost of owning mutual funds is not just their respective [[Expense ratios |expense ratios]]. You also need to be aware of the total cost of ownership, including the '''additional costs''' described in this article.

==Transaction costs==

In addition to a fund's acquisition and redemption charges, and its expense ratio, funds also have extra expenses not included in their expense ratios. These expenses include fund transaction costs from buying and selling fund securities. In general, these transaction costs are proportional to a fund's annual turnover rate: the higher the turnover, the greater the transaction cost. For equity funds, transaction expense breaks down into:
*'''Brokerage commission expense''': The fund's annual [[Statement of additional information |statement of additional information]] shows brokerage commission expense each year. In a 2004 ZAG commissioned study,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author1=Jason Karceski| author2=Miles Livingston| author3=Edward S. O'Neal| url= https://thefloat.typepad.com/the_float/files/2004_zag_study_on_mutual_fund_trading_costs.pdf| title=Portfolio Transactions Costs at U.S. Equity Mutual Funds| date=2004| accessdate=September 1, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; authors Jason Karceski, Miles Livingston, and Edward S. O'Neal, found that in 2002, mutual funds paid an average commission of 0.38% and a weighted dollar commission (what investors actually held) of 0.19%. In a 2004 study, Lipper&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://pdf.forbes.com/media/pdfs/2005/0105funds.pdf| title=Mutual Fund Trading and Portfolio Transaction Costs| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050114200506/http://pdf.forbes.com/media/pdfs/2005/0105funds.pdf| archive-date=January 14, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that the average weighted commission paid by mutual funds measured 0.20% in 2003, with a range of expense between 0.01% and 8.73%.
*'''Spreads''': When a stock is bought or sold, there is a [[Bid/ask spread |spread]] between the purchase and selling price. This cost cannot be precisely quantified for mutual funds, but in general, spread costs are higher for small stocks than for large stocks; higher for illiquid stocks than liquid ones; and higher for international stocks as opposed to domestic stocks.
*'''Market impact''': A mutual fund making large transactions in a stock is likely to move the stock price before the order is completely filled. This transaction cost, similar to spread costs, must be estimated.

Most estimates put total transaction costs as almost equal a fund's expense ratio. 

*''Median'' mutual fund transaction costs have been estimated to measure between 0.7% and 0.85% annual cost drag (ranging from 0.55% for large cap stocks up to 2.33% for small cap stocks.)
*''Mean'' transaction costs are estimated at 1.44% for the average fund, ranging from a mean of 0.77% for large cap stocks to a mean of 2.85% for small cap stocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author1=Roger M. Edelen| author2=Richard B. Evans| author3=Gregory B. Kadlec| title=Scale Effects in Mutual Fund Performance: The Role of Trading Costs| date=March 17, 2007| url=https://ssrn.com/abstract=951367}} Available at SSRN.&lt;/ref&gt;

Choosing passively managed, low turnover index funds greatly reduces transaction costs. Brokerage expense for index funds measures less than 0.01% for most large cap indexes and domestic indexes, up to 0.40% for emerging market stocks.

==Hidden costs==

Mutual funds can derive income from '''soft dollars''' and '''directed brokerage''' practices. The SEC defines soft dollars as:&lt;ref name="softdolr"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.sec.gov/news/studies/softdolr.htm| title=Inspection Report on the Soft Dollar Practices of Broker-Dealers, Investment Advisers and Mutual Funds| date=September 22, 1998| publisher=SEC| accessdate=September 1, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quotation|... arrangements under which products or services other than execution of securities transactions are obtained by an adviser from or through a broker-dealer in exchange for the direction by the adviser of client brokerage transactions to the broker-dealer.|SEC}}

The SEC defines directed brokerage as:&lt;ref name="softdolr" /&gt;
{{quotation|In soft dollar arrangements, an investment adviser selects the brokers that will execute trades and provide research and other services to the adviser. In contrast, in a "directed brokerage" arrangement, a client asks its adviser, subject to the adviser's satisfaction that the client is receiving best execution, to direct commission business to a particular broker that has agreed to provide services, pay obligations or make cash rebates to the client.|SEC}}

As these costs are transaction costs, they are not a part of a fund's expense ratio. The SEC carefully defines sanctioned uses of soft dollar commissions:&lt;ref name="softdolr" /&gt;
{{quotation|
Section 28(e)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.moneymanagerservices.com/Laws/sea_section_28e.cfm| title=Section 28(e)| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020106053105/http://moneymanagerservices.com/Laws/sea_section_28e.cfm| archive-date=January 6, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; defines when a person is deemed to be providing brokerage and research services, and states that a person provides brokerage and research services insofar as he/she:

*(A) furnishes advice directly or through publications or writing as to the value of securities, the advisability of investing in, purchasing or selling securities, or the availability of purchasers or sellers of securities;
*(B) furnishes analyses and reports concerning issuers, industries, securities, economic factors and trends, portfolio strategy and performance of accounts; or
*(C) effects securities transactions and performs functions incidental thereto (such as clearance, settlement, and custody) or required therewith by rules of the Commission or a self-regulatory organization of which such person is a member or person associated with a member or in which such person is a participant.|SEC}}

The SEC Inspection Report on the Soft Dollar Practices of Broker-Dealers, Investment Advisers and Mutual Funds&lt;ref name="softdolr" /&gt; found the following: 
{{quotation|While most broker-dealers provided only products and services which were clearly research, fully 35% of the broker-dealers that we examined paid for at least one product or service which appeared to be unrelated to research or execution.66 These products/services included, among other things: rent, computer hardware used for administrative or personal use, CFA exam review courses, AIMR membership dues, travel expenses, cable and satellite television for non-research areas, telephone service, employees' salaries, messenger services, consulting services, postage, parking fees, office equipment, word processing software, tuition and tax preparation services.|SEC}}

Harold Bradley, senior vice president of American Century Investments, estimates that fund companies amass $10&amp;nbsp;billion annually in soft dollar business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/what-are-soft-dollars/| title=What are Soft Dollars| publisher=Investopedia| accessdate=September 1, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cash drag==
{{Main|Cash drag}}

Cash drag is an erosion of return caused by cash held by a mutual fund. A mutual fund typically holds cash for redemptions and for future investments. Because the underlying securities of a mutual fund, especially stocks, often have better long term returns than cash, holding cash tends to reduce the performance of the fund. The [https://www.ici.org/ Investment Company Institute] posts a monthly report of mutual fund cash positions.

==Tax costs==

Most mutual funds held in a taxable account have some sort of tax cost as they make one or more type of distributions, for which you have to pay tax even if you do not sell the funds. Tax cost comes from two sources - dividends and capital gains. In 2007, Lipper reports that shareholders in taxable fund accounts paid at least $23.8 billion in taxes on fund distributions of $418.5 billion, a cost amounting to 1.3 percent of assets.&lt;ref&gt;Lipper Associates, 2007. "Taxes in the Mutual Fund Industry – 2007: Assessing the Impact of Taxes on Shareholder Returns", New York: Lipper Associates.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The table below shows estimated taxes paid by investors on fund distributions for 2005-2007:

{| class=wikitable style="text-align:center;"
|+{{nowrap|Estimated mutual fund tax cost on fund distributions}}
! Year !! Distributions !! Tax paid
|-
| 2007||$418.5 billion ||$23.8 billion
|-
| 2006||$200 billion||$20 billion
|-
| 2005||$129 billion||$15.2 billion
|- 
|}&lt;/ref&gt;
Lipper estimates that over the past twenty years, the average taxable mutual fund investor paid taxes consuming 17 to 44 percent of fund returns. 

Dividends split into two distinct tax categories: [[Qualified dividend | qualified dividends]] and [[Non-qualified dividends | non-qualified dividends]]. Some funds, typically taxable bond funds and REIT funds, tend to distribute non-qualified dividends. Equity funds tend to distribute some qualified dividends. You pay less tax on qualified dividends than non-qualified dividends under the current tax code. 

[[Capital gains distribution |Capital gains]] also split into two categories, namely short-term capital gains and long-term capital gains. You pay tax on your short-term gains at your marginal income tax rate; your long-term gains are taxed at lower, tax-preferred rates. As the fund internally sells securities, it may realize capital gains. The must distribute gains that are not offset by the fund's loss carryforward to its shareholders.

A '''return of capital distribution''' (IRS terminology refers to these distributions as "nondividend distributions") differ from ordinary dividends in that they are not made out of earnings, but are made out of capital. Mutual funds are one of the business entities which can make a return of capital distribution.  When an investment is held in a taxable account, these distributions are, under most circumstances, non-taxable. The distribution reduces the tax basis of the fund. Thus, the distribution is taxed at capital gains tax rates when an investor sells fund shares. If the return of capital distributions are larger than the tax basis of shares, the distribution is taxed as a capital gain. 

:''Example'': An investor holds a stock with a $10 basis. The investor receives a $2 return of capital dividend. The $2 dividend is not taxable income. The investor reduces the basis of the stock to $8 dollars. If the investor sells the stock for $10, the $2 profit will be reported as a taxable gain and will be taxed as either a short term or long term gain depending on how long the investor has held the stock.

==Adjusting basis==
When you receive a return of capital distribution it will be reported on line 3 of the 1099-DIV. According to Fairmark, take the following steps to adjust basis:

*If you're using the single-category averaging method to determine your basis.  Find the amount in box 3 of Form 1099-DIV and subtract that amount from the total basis of your shares.
*If you're using any other method to determine your basis:
#Start with the amount in box 3 of Form 1099-DIV.
#Divide that figure by the number of shares to which it applies. This tells you the amount of the adjustment per share.

==Vanguard funds making return of capital distributions==
Vanguard has a number of funds which are prone to make return of capital distributions.
* '''Real Estate funds''': The Vanguard REIT Index Fund and Vanguard Global ex-U.S. Real Estate Index Fund. In the case of equity REIT funds, the return of capital distribution mainly reflects the  accounting value of real estate depreciation (operating earnings are in excess of earnings including depreciation). As most dividends distributed by equity REITS are [[Non-qualified dividends | non-qualified]] dividends, taxed at marginal rates, the return  of capital dividend serves, for taxable account investors, to both defer taxation and to switch the taxation of the distribution from marginal rates to usually lower capital gains rates.
* '''Managed Payout Fund''': As a part of the Vanguard Managed Payout Fund's managed distribution policy, monthly income distributions can come from dividends, realized capital gains, and return of capital.
* '''Inflation-Protected Securities Fund''': Mutual funds which hold [[TIPS]] are required to distribute as dividends both the coupon on the bond and the inflation adjustment. In some quarters, deflation is more than the bond yield, and thus the amount Vanguard Inflation-Protected Securities Fund needs to distribute for the year is less after the fourth quarter than after preceding quarters. The fund makes no distribution, and recharacterizes part of the dividend as a return of capital so that the dividends for the full year are the correct amount. Historically, the fund has made return of capital distributions in the 2007 and 2016 fiscal years.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' are registered investment companies. Other forms of the registered investment company include [[Mutual  fund | mutual funds]],  [[Exchange-traded funds|exchange traded funds]], and [[Unit investment trusts | unit investment trusts]].

==Characteristics==
A closed-end fund, similar to other registered investment companies, represents a pooled investment vehicle that holds investment securities, such as [[Stock basics |stocks]] and [[Bond basics | bonds]] and other securities. Closed-end funds are actively managed portfolios, which, like mutual funds, possess a [[Net asset value | net asset value]] (NAV). Unlike open-end mutual funds however, which issue and redeem fund shares directly to investors, a closed end fund raises capital through an initial public offering (IPO) and is then listed on a national exchange such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) or the NASDAQ. The fund is then bought and sold from other investors just like any other stock. The fund trades at its market price, which may be at a discount or premium to its NAV according to the dictates of supply and demand for the shares. The table below outlines some of the basic comparative features of open-end and closed-end funds:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cefconnect.com/Education/WhatIsACEF.aspx CEF Connect: What is a CEF?]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Creation of shares===
Closed-end shares are initially created by an initial public offering. Additional shares may be created by dividend and capital gains distributions being reinvested into the fund, and by a fund issuing rights for new share issuance. Rights offer current shareholders the right to purchase new shares, usually at a discounted price, in proportion to the shareholder's current ownership stake in the fund. The shareholder can exercise her rights by purchasing the shares, or, if the rights are transferable, selling her rights on the market.

===Premiums and discounts===
[[File:HistoricalClosedEndFundsDailyAvg.gif|thumb|left|250px|HISTORICAL CLOSED-END FUNDS DAILY AVERAGE PREMIUM/DISCOUNT
(12/5/07 — 9/30/09)'' Claymore CEF Index''‎]] 
The fact that a closed-end fund trades on the open market results in a fund's market price moving independently of a fund's net asset value. If the price is lower than net asset value, the fund is said to be trading at a ''discount''; if it trades at a price higher than net asset value, the fund is said to trade at a ''premium''. Premiums and discounts fluctuate. In general, it can be attractive to purchase a fund at a discount to NAV, since doing so allows you to receive a higher yield from the purchase than you would receive if buying at NAV. One major caution about purchasing a closed-end fund initial public offering is that the fund's market price will almost invariably drop to a discount once the underwriters stop supporting the offering.&lt;ref&gt;Annette Thau, An Investor's Guide to Closed-End Muni Funds, AAII Journal, September 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Astute investors, after examining a fund’s investment objectives and the quality of fund management, tend to prefer to buy closed-end funds at discount to NAV.  In seeking good value an investor should analyze the discount according to three factors:
*The size of past discounts (the deeper the current discount the better)
*Discounts on competing portfolios (the deeper the current discount the better)
*The fund’s expense ratio 

Fredman and Wiles in ''[[Special:BookSources/978-0138397210|How Mutual Funds Work]]'', suggest that dividing the discount by the [[Expense ratios | expense ratio]] provides a good metric of relative value, with ratios over 10 suggesting good value.&lt;ref&gt; Albert J. Fredman and Russ Wiles,  (1998) How Mutual Funds Work, Prentiss Hall Inc., ISBN 0-13-839721-X &lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;

The effect of buying a fund at a premium to net asset value, and having the fund fall into a discount can be seen in the following table:

|-
| Premium/Discount || 19.05% ||-11.76%||
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

===Expenses===
Closed-end funds do not have the [[Mutual funds and fees#Sales Fees | sales charges]] associated with open-end load funds, nor do they have 12b-1 distribution fees. You must, however, pay brokerage commissions and spread costs when purchasing a closed-end fund on an exchange. Closed-end funds, like mutual funds, also have an [[Expense ratios | expense ratio]]. Many closed-end funds employ leverage, and the expense ratio of a leveraged fund will include the interest cost of the borrowed funds. In general, closed-end funds are not low-cost vehicles.

===Leverage===

One major difference between open-end mutual funds and closed-end funds is in the capital structure of the funds. In addition to common stock, the Investment Company Act of 1940 permits closed-end funds to issue [[Preferred stock |preferred stock]]. Preferred stock differs from common stock in that preferred shareholders are paid dividends and have priority to income and assets of the fund on liquidation but do not share in the gains and losses of the fund. The funds can also use other means of leveraging such as borrowing money or issuing debt securities. The Investment Company Act of 1940 sets asset coverage requirements for closed-end funds. For each $1 dollar of debt issued, the fund must have $3 of assets immediately after issuance and at the time of dividend declarations (commonly referred to as 33% leverage). Similarly, for each $1 of preferred stock issued, the fund must have $2 of assets at issuance and dividend declaration dates (commonly referred to as 50% leverage).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ici.org/policy/regulation/products/closed-end/faqs_closed_end ICI: Frequently Asked Questions About Closed-End Funds and Their Use of Leverage]&lt;/ref&gt;
Approximately 72% of closed-end funds employ leverage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.closed-endfunds.com/FundSelector/LeveragedFunds.fs CEFA: Leveraged Funds]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Up until February 2008, closed-end funds mostly issued auction market preferred stock (AMPS), a type of preferred share that pays dividends at rates set through auctions. Typically, dividend rates are reset through auctions that are held every seven or 28 days. In February 2008, the auction markets failed, and since then auction market preferred stock is no longer issued. The funds have used other means of leveraging including an attempt to establish a new type of preferred stock, [http://www.experts123.com/q/how-does-puttable-preferred-stock-compare-to-auction-market-preferred-stock.html puttable preferred stock], as a funding instrument.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ici.org/policy/regulation/products/closed-end/faqs_closed_end ICI: Frequently Asked Questions About Closed-End Funds and Their Use of Leverage]&lt;/ref&gt;

A fund's reported ''effective leverage'' percentage will include not only the capital structure leverage (statutory) but also the leverage provided by the fund manager's use of derivative products (portfolio).

Funds employ leverage to enhance the portfolio's yield. Leverage works to the advantage of the fund when the yield curve is upward sloping and steep, and when the difference between short term rates and long term rates is high. When the yield curve flattens or inverts, leverage works to the detriment of the fund. The leverage increases the fund's volatility of returns.

===Managed distribution policy===
{{Quote
|quote     = "'''Distribution Yield''': Total 12-month cash payments per share, divided by ending market price (or NAV, as appropriate).  Such payments may include unknown combinations of income, short- and long-term capital gains, and return of capital.  Commonly known as Market (NAV) Yield. This should not be considered the equivalent of total return performance calculations. Yield figures are as of most recent month-end.
'''Income Only Yield''': Based upon the latest annual report, net investment income (NII) for common shares (after subtraction of dividends paid on preferred shares) in full dollars, divided by average net assets (ANA) in full dollars, expressed as a percentage; it does not include return of capital. Thus, $2.2mm NII on $100 MM ANA would be 2.2%. Yield figures are as of most recent month-end. "

}}
Managed distribution policies are available to closed-end funds through an application to the SEC for exemption under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Approximately 6% of closed-end funds employ a managed distribution policy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cefa.com/ManagedDistributions/default.fs CEFA: Funds with Managed Distribution Policies]&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, a fund adopting a managed distribution policy attempts to make relatively predictable, steady cash flows to investors based upon a projected long term return assumption for the fund. The distributions can be either a static amount per common share, or a percentage of the fund's recent or average net asset value. The distributions are made from the following components:
*net investment income
*a portion of short term and long term gains
*return of capital

The most commonly cited motivation for a fund's adopting a managed distribution policy is that such a payout policy may reduce a fund's discount to net asset value.&lt;ref&gt;Wang, Zhi Jay and Nanda, Vikram K., Why Do Aggressive Payout Policies Reduce Fund Discounts - Is It Signaling, Agency Costs, or Dividend Preferences? (March 4, 2008). AFA 2009 San Francisco Meetings Paper. Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=1102715&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cherkes, Martin, Sagi, Jacob S. and Wang, Zhi Jay, A Neoclassical Model of Managed Distribution Plans: Theory and Evidence (November 15, 2009). Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=1517004&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the redistributed capital distributions included in the distribution yield of a closed-end fund, it should not be confused with the net investment yield of the fund.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cefa.com/ManagedDistributions/default.fs CEFA:Funds with Managed Distribution Policies]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Closed end fund categories==
Because a closed-end fund is not subject to investor flows into or out of the portfolio, fund managers are more likely to remain fully invested in comparison to mutual fund managers. The SEC also allows a closed-end fund to invest in a greater amount of illiquid securities than can mutual funds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sec.gov/answers/mfclose.htm SEC: Closed-End Funds]
&lt;/ref&gt; Closed-end funds are usually grouped into four main categories:
*US Tax-exempt fixed income
*US Taxable fixed income
*Global/Non-US fixed income
*US equity
*Global/Non US equity 

===Tax exempt bonds===
{{Main|Municipal bonds}}
{{Quote
|quote     = &lt;u&gt;Annette Thau: Advice on When to Buy&lt;/u&gt;:
*Never buy a fund at issue.
*Only buy if the fund its trading at a wide discount to net asset value; that would also be at a time when its yield would be particularly attractive.
*One variation of this piece of advice is to track the discount pattern of a fund, and only buy it if its discount is wider than the normal discount. Sell when the discount narrows."
|source    = -- ''Annette Thau, An Investor's Guide to Closed-End Muni Funds, AAII Journal, September 2006''

Tax-Exempt bond funds comprise the largest segment of the closed-end fund universe. Portfolios include national municipal bond funds, high yield municipal bond funds, and municipal bond funds covering 17 individual states.

Almost 95% of the funds are leveraged, with a typical effective leverage of around 30% of the total net assets of a fund. By borrowing funds at lower short term rates and investing in higher yielding longer term bonds, a fund can increase its yield, although at a greater risk of increased volatility of capital. Leverage works to the advantage of the fund when the yield curve is upward sloping and steep, and when the difference between short term rates and long term rates is high. When the yield curve flattens, leverage works to the detriment of the fund. Thus, in situations where short term rates rise (increasing borrowing costs) or long term rates rise (falling NAV),  a fund may find itself facing:
* having to cut the dividend;
* seeing the NAV fall;
* investor sales causing the market price of the fund to fall.&lt;ref&gt;Annette Thau, An Investor's Guide To Closed-end Muni Funds, AAII Journal, September, 2006, pp.7-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

If a closed end fund has a managed distribution policy, the yield distribution can include capital gains and return of capital distributions in addition to a distribution of net investment income. Funds are required to publish income ratios (net investment income divided by net asset value) but this figure will differ from the published "yield" you see based on market price.

===Taxable bonds===
Closed-end funds invest in a wide range of taxable fixed income securities, including investment grade corporate bonds, high yield corporate bonds, mortgage securities, convertible bonds, preferred securities, master limited partnerships, and  senior loan participation funds. A limited number of closed-end funds invest in inflation indexed bonds. Most funds employ leverage.

'''{{PAGENAME}}?''' Posts asking why{{quotation|The market was up but my fund is (unexpectedly) down}} are quite frequent on the Bogleheads forum, particularly in late December. The usual answer to this question is that the fund's value dropped because it paid a [[Dividend|distribution]].

==Fund net asset values and fund distributions==

[[Mutual fund|Mutual funds]] and [[Exchange-traded fund|exchange-traded funds]] (ETFs) must pay net income and net realized [[Capital gains distribution|capital gains]] to their shareholders at least annually.&lt;ref name="cornell"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/4982| title=26 U.S. Code § 4982 - Excise tax on undistributed income of regulated investment companies| publisher=Legal Law Institute, Cornell University Law School| accessdate=December 12, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; While some do so monthly or quarterly, most do so annually, during the last half of December. Funds gain income from the securities they hold ([[Dividend|dividends]] for funds holding [[Stock basics|stocks]], and interest income for funds holding [[Bond basics|bonds]] and [[Money market|money market instruments]]).&lt;ref group="note"&gt; Funds also receive interest income from lending portfolio securities, from earning interest on temporary cash balances, and from amortizing bond discounts and premiums.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Also, funds may realize capital gains when they liquidate holdings. In order for the fund company to avoid having to pay taxes, the law requires that the fund pays these dividends and capital gains to shareholders, so that the shareholders pay any taxes due.&lt;ref name="cornell" /&gt; In taxable accounts, you will receive a Form 1099-DIV in January for any distribution payments.

If your stock or [[Balanced fund|balanced fund]] is paying out a dividend or capital gains distribution, or both, the [[Net asset value|net asset value]] (NAV) of the fund will drop by the per share amount of the distributions (most bond funds accrue interest so that [[Net asset value#Bond funds versus equity funds|dividend distributions do not reduce net asset value]]). Taxes aside, the distributions do not change your economic position, regardless of whether you re-invest the distributions in the fund or take them in cash. 

If your fund has a surprising drop in value, follow these guidelines to help figure out what happened:

* '''Check your online statement.''' Be aware that the dividend may not be paid until a few days after it is declared. 
* '''Check the fund’s web site.''' For mutual funds, the ex-dividend date is typically the first business day after the record date.&lt;ref group="note"&gt; Vanguard provides a link to a Reuters tool for finding historical ex-dividend dates on its [https://personal.vanguard.com/us/insights/taxcenter/tax-information-vanguardfunds Tax Information for Vanguard Funds]{{dead link}} page. To open the tool, click the "Research ex-dividend dates" heading link.&lt;/ref&gt;

** Vanguard: [https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/list/mutual-funds Mutual funds], [https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/list/etfs Exchange-traded funds]
*'''Check your e-mail.''' Fund companies routinely send e-mails in advance of paying distributions. Fund holders routinely ignore these e-mails.
*'''Check out the fund history at the providers website, or financial websites such as [http://finance.yahoo.com/ Yahoo! Finance] or [https://www.google.com/finance Google Finance].''' These sites often show the date and amount of distributions paid. Data for past years (dates and amounts paid) may be quite useful for your planning.

If you are invested in a tax-advantaged account with dividends reinvested, none of this really matters, because the distributions are shielded from current taxation. (You might ask yourself why you are paying so much attention to daily price fluctuations.)

In a taxable account, the distribution does matter, because it is an involuntary taxable event. You probably should [[Timing of transactions to reduce taxes#Buy after distributions|wait until after the distribution]] to purchase new holdings in the fund. And, if you are selling the fund in a taxable account, you would want to sell before the distribution in order to avoid paying taxes (at probably less favorable rates) on the distribution. See [[Dividend#Dates and timing|dates and timing]] for descriptions of the different dates associated with distributions.

==Why does my economic position not change?==

If you are reinvesting dividends, and you check before and after the distribution, you will see that you now own a larger number of shares of the mutual fund. When the dividend is paid, the share price drops by the amount of the dividend; but because you reinvested, you own more of those lower-valued shares, and it all balances out.

If you are '''not''' reinvesting dividends, then in your statement the total value of your ''fund'' falls; but because of the distribution, your money market settlement account now has a ''higher'' value, because the dividends were paid into that account.

Of course, the intrinsic value the marketplace puts on each share continuously fluctuates day by day, so the numbers will not add up exactly.

Most published daily returns will adjust for the distribution, so that you will not see the drop. For example, if your fund reported a value of $30.00 on December 19, paid a $2.00 distribution, and reported a value of $28.28 on December 20, the reported daily change will be +0.28 and +1%. If you held the fund and reinvested the distribution, you did gain 1%, so this is the correct number for the fund performance.

==Fair value pricing and international index funds==
[[File:Fairvaluepricing.jpg|thumb|right|550px| Example: [http://www.msci.com/fairvalue/IDCo/ What is fair market pricing?],{{broken link}} MSCI]]
After the [[Wikipedia:2003 mutual fund scandal |2003 mutual fund scandal]], the SEC requirement that mutual fund companies institute fair value pricing became more widely used by mutual fund companies. The situation arose due to the fact that European and Pacific stock markets close many hours before the U.S. markets close. Thus the closing stock prices upon which mutual funds value their [[net asset value]] (NAV) at 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time are hours old. Investors having knowledge of subsequent information strongly suggesting higher or lower prices can place buy or sell orders at the stale net asset price and sell or buy at a profit the next trading day. Critics of this practice argue that such acts of time-zone arbitrage from short-term market timing imposes higher costs and diminished returns for long-term investors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.thestreet.com/personal-finance/sec-to-mutual-funds-take-down-arbitrage-welcome-signs-1413555| title=SEC to Mutual Funds: Take Down 'Arbitrage Welcome' Signs| publisher=TheStreet| accessdate=July 9, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The return disparities introduced by fair market pricing can be either positive or negative in relation to the benchmark index return. 

===Finding fair market pricing adjustments for Vanguard international index funds===

Beginning in 2005, each Vanguard international [[index fund]] annual report gives annual fund returns that have been skewed by fair value pricing. Although the reports state that the resulting discrepancy is short-lived and is likely to reverse the next day, the precise impact of the fair value adjustment is not disclosed. 

While Vanguard does not provide daily fair market pricing data, they do report the adjustment on a quarterly basis on their Institutional Investors site.

To get the information, take the following steps;
*Go to the Vanguard Institutional Investors site;
*Under browse, select the Equity link;
*Select the share classes option;
*Scroll down the list to international equities tab and open it;
*Find your desired fund (for example, the Vanguard Pacific Index Fund Admiral Shares) and open the page;
*Select the performance tab.

The performance tab will provide a table of returns data for the fund, benchmark, and fair value pricing impact. These are reported on a quarterly basis. A drop box allows you to access historical data.

The fund's actual return is calculated by subtracting the fair value pricing impact percentage from the reported fund return.

==Share splits==
A share split is often done by splitting the existing shares into multiple shares. This lowers the value of each share by the amount of the split.  A 4-for-1 stock split replaces each share owned with 4 shares and each share is now worth 1/4th of what it was before the split. The net value of the shareholder's account does not change. The table below shows the resulting number of shares owned, the hypothetical [[Net asset value|net asset value]], and the value of shares, assuming a 4-for-1 share split.

|}

To properly account for the tax cost basis after a mutual fund share split:
* Increase your position by the stock split rate on the Ex-Dividend Date 
* Maintain your original total cost
* Maintain your original holding period
* Decrease your cost per share (to three decimal places, e.g. a $24.25 cost per share to a $12.125 cost per share in a 2-for-1 split)&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gainskeeper.com/siebert/siebert_fund.htm#Splits Gainskeeper: Splits], viewed 13 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Share split rationale===
Critics of mutual fund share splits argue that the underlying economic position of a shareholder is unchanged by a share split, and that fund companies use the procedure for marketing purposes. Marketing purposes include reducing a fund's high net asset value to a level more in line with current fund offerings&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thestreet.com/story/668251/1/do-mutual-funds-ever-split-their-shares.html Do mutual funds ever split there shares], Dagen McDowell, thestreet.com. 01/20/99, viewed 12 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1999-10-24/business/9910230350_1_internet-fund-funds-and-stocks-investors No value, only gimmickry when fund shares are split], Charles A. Jaffe, The Baltimore Sun, October 24, 1999, viewed 12 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;, and to increase fund sales. A Wharton study on mutual fund share splits concludes:
 
''We find that mutual funds that do split experience significant post-split increases in net asset inflow and the number of shareholders. Our findings suggest that fund managers use splits to attract new money, and that fund managers regard splits as enhancing the marketability of mutual fund shares.''&lt;ref&gt;Fernando, Chitru S. and Krishnamurthy, Srinivasan and Spindt, Paul A., ''[http://ssrn.com/abstract=8288 Is Share Price Related to Marketability? Evidence from Mutual Fund Share Splits]'', (August 1999). 97-06. Available at SSRN.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reverse share splits==
A reverse share split is the opposite of a share split. A reverse split occurs when a fund company decides to decrease the number of fund shares by combining the existing shares into fewer shares. This increases the per share value of the share. A 1-for-5 reverse stock split replaces each 5 shares owned with 1 share and each share is now worth 5 times what it was before the reverse split.  The net value of the shareholder's account does not change. The table below shows the resulting number of shares owned, the hypothetical net asset value, and the value of shares, assuming a 1-for-5 reverse share split.

| Pre-Split||1000||$6.00||$6,000.00
|- align="center"
| Post-Split||200||$30.00||$6,000.00
|}

To properly account for the tax cost basis after a mutual fund reverse share split:
* Decrease your position by the stock split rate on Ex-Dividend Date 
* Maintain your original total cost
* Maintain your original holding period
* Increase your cost per share (to three decimal places)

===Reverse share split rationale===
Reverse share splits are more frequent with [[Exchange-traded fund|exchange-traded fund]]s (ETFs). The rationale for reverse splits include the following:
* '''To maintain listing on an exchange''': An exchange generally specifies a minimum bid price for a stock to be listed. If the stock falls below this bid price, it risks being delisted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/reversesplit.asp Reverse stock split], investopedia, viewed 12 January, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''To lower shareholder transaction costs when buying and selling the ETF.''' The higher price is expected to reduce bid/ask spreads.&lt;ref name="Vanguard"/&gt;

====A special case====
American Century offers investors a series of mutual funds that invest in [[Zero-coupon bond|zero coupon treasury bonds]]. The funds terminate at an expected value when the zero treasury bond matures. When any fund pays a distribution (the IRS requires investors to pay annual taxes on interest accrual) it causes the share price to fall by the distribution amount on the distribution date. In order for the Zero Coupon fund(s) to reach their anticipated share value by its target year, a reverse share split is necessary. This allows the fund(s) to distribute a dividend and any capital gains without decreasing the share price.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.americancentury.com/content/americancentury/direct/en/investment-planning/tax-center/reverse-share-split.html Why do a reverse split?], American Century Investments, viewed 12 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mutual fund share conversions==
Mutual fund companies often offer various share classes for a specific mutual fund. Investors reaching certain milestones, such as total amount invested in the fund or length of time the shares have been held, frequently qualify for a conversion to lower cost shares. The conversion often takes place at differing net asset values, so the number of shares held after conversion will be different, although the value of the investor's account is unchanged.

Examples of such conversions include:
*The conversion of B-shares to A-shares for load-fund mutual fund offerings;
*The conversion of shares with higher expense ratios for shares with lower expense ratios (Vanguard admiral shares and Fidelity advantage class shares are examples of shares with lower expense ratios). Note that if the amount invested falls below a required minimum, a conversion of lower expense shares for higher expense shares can take place;
*At Vanguard, the [[Exchange-traded fund#How to convert mutual funds to ETFs at Vanguard |conversion]] of an index mutual fund into the fund's exchange-traded fund share class.

      <text bytes="1612" sha1="lghr9jxz0d45ezcj4an2yq60ho98fwg" xml:space="preserve">'''Cash drag''' as applied to a [[Mutual fund|mutual fund]], is a diminution of return caused by  holding a cash position.  A mutual fund typically holds a cash position to facilitate redemptions and pending investments. Since underlying securities of a mutual fund, especially [[Stock basics|stocks]], often have better long-term returns than cash, a permanent cash position tends to reduce the performance of the fund. Cash drag is more pronounced among actively managed funds, which typically hold higher cash reserves than [[Index fund|index funds]], which usually remain fully invested.

[[John Bogle]], in his article, ''The Arithmetic of ‘All-In’ Investment Expenses'', published in the Financial Analysts Journal&lt;ref&gt; John C.

This results in a 0.30% cost. Bogle assumes that many large active funds will partially equitize  the fund's cash position through the use of stock index futures or [[Exchange-traded fund|exchange-traded funds]]. Thus, he cuts his estimate of cost by half, resulting in an estimated 0.15% annual cost.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' (July 23, 1898 - September 2, 1998) was the founder of the Wellington Fund, the first [[Balanced fund|balanced mutual fund]] in the United States. Morgan was also the founder of the [[Wellington Management Company]]. Morgan was born in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, and is an alumnus of Princeton University. He died in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/walter-l-morgan-mutual-fund-pioneer-and-founder-of-vanguardwellington-fund-dies-76443247.html| title=Walter L.

After graduation from Princeton University, Morgan was employed as an accountant, becoming the youngest CPA in Pennsylvania. Realizing that clients were in need of investment counsel, Morgan founded a balanced mutual fund, called the Industrial and Power Securities Company. Initially, Morgan raised investment funds from family and friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.journalofaccountancy.com/Issues/1998/Nov/obituary.htm| title=Wellington Fund Founder Dies| date=November 1, 1998| publisher=Journal of Accountancy| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20241207123550/https://www.journalofaccountancy.com/Issues/1998/Nov/obituary.htm| archive-date=December 7, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fund made investments in cash, bonds, preferred stock, and common stock, and did not use [[leverage]]. The balanced allocation allowed the fund to survive the 1929 stock market collapse and the ensuing depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=https://johncbogle.com/speeches/JCB_WMC1203.pdf| title=Reflections on Wellington Fund’s 75th Birthday| author=John Bogle| author-link=John Bogle}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1935 Morgan changed the name of the fund to Wellington Fund.

[[File:Morgan-building.jpg|thumbnail|left|Morgan building, Vanguard, Valley Forge Pa.]]
In 1951, Morgan hired [[John Bogle]] to the Wellington Management Company. Morgan transferred management of the company to Bogle in 1965 by naming him executive vice president. Under Bogle, the firm increased its fund offerings, adding the Wellington Equity Fund (now the Windsor Fund after a 1963 name change). 

In 1966 Bogle merged the company with the Boston based investment counseling firm of Thorndike, Doran, Paine and Lewis, managers of the Ivest Fund. The firm continued to add fund offerings. A corporate dispute led to Bogle being fired from the firm on January 23, 1974. Bogle went on to create the [[The Vanguard Group|Vanguard Group]], with Wellington Management Company retained as investment manager of the ten funds then under management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://anbhf.org/fellows/john-bogle/| title=John Bogle| publisher=American National Business Hall of Fame| accessdate=April 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Slater| date=October 1, 1996| title=John Bogle and the Vanguard Experiment| publisher=McGraw-Hill| pages=28-39| isbn=978-0-7863-0559-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''George U. "Gus" Sauter''' is noted as the head investment manager of Vanguard [[Index fund|index funds]] from 1987 through 2003, and as the creator of Vanguard's [[exchange-traded funds]].

==Early life and education==

Sauter was born in 1954 to Jean Upham and George Sauter in Mansfield Ohio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/mansfieldnewsjournal/obituary.aspx?pid=173392710| title=Jean U. Sauter obituary| publisher=Legacy.com| date=December 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At age eight, he started taking deposits and making loans for his Cleveland neighbors; he was eleven when he bought shares in the Cleveland Cavaliers. He earned an A.B. in economics from Dartmouth College and an M.B.A. in finance from the University of Chicago.&lt;ref&gt; {{Cite web| author=Janet Paskin|title=A New Vanguard for Gus Sauter|url=http://www.barrons.com/articles/SB50001424053111904414004578020340146687174|publisher=Barrons|date=October 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976 Sauter took his first job with Chiquita Banana—the United Brands Company. This job lasted one year. He next worked for the First National Bank of Boston. While studying at Chicago University, Sauter worked for a small real estate company, both in Chicago and Denver. While employed with the real estate firm, Sauter put together a venture capital deal and formed a gold mine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.cfainstitute.org/community/careers/Documents/Sauter_Interview.pdf| title=Sauter interview| publisher=CFA Institute}}{{dead link}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Sauter began his career in investment management as a trust investment officer with First Bancorp of Ohio (formerly The First National Bank of Ohio) and joined Vanguard in 1987. He was hired two weeks before the October 1987 market crash. At Vanguard he was given the reins to a nascent Quantitative Equity group and was the head investment manager of the firm's equity index funds. At the time, Vanguard's lone equity index fund and lone bond index fund held 1.4 billion dollars, representing just 3% of Vanguard's asset base.&lt;ref name="press release"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://pressroom.vanguard.com/news/cio_guss_sauter_announces_retirement.html| title=Vanguard Chief Investment Officer Gus Sauter Announces Plans to Retire After 25-Year Career| publisher=Vanguard| date=June 22, 2012| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181009171526/https://pressroom.vanguard.com/news/cio_guss_sauter_announces_retirement.html| archive-date=October 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Drew Voros|title=Retiring Vanguard CIO Gus Sauter Looks Back|url=http://www.etf.com/sections/features/15487-retiring-vanguard-cio-gus-sauter-looks-back-.html?nopaging=1|publisher=Etf.com|date=December 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Sauter's direction, Vanguard expanded its line-up of equity index funds. In addition, he helped develop new trading programs and strategies that minimized [[Mutual funds: additional costs#Transaction costs|trading costs]] and enhanced benchmark [[tracking error|tracking]] precision.&lt;ref name="press release"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| author=William Bernstein| title=Selection Skill, Transactional Skill| url=http://www.efficientfrontier.com/ef/900/ts.htm| publisher=Efficient Frontier| date=Fall 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sauter also oversaw development of Vanguard's active Quantitative Equity Group, which now manages 15 Vanguard active funds.

From 2003 through 2012, Sauter served as Vanguard’s chief investment officer. In that role, he was responsible for the oversight of approximately $1.7 trillion managed globally by Vanguard Fixed Income and Equity Investment Groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://vanguardblog.com/author/gus-sauter/| title=Gus Sauter| publisher=Vanguard Blog}}{{dead link}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003 Sauter helped create Vanguard's foray into exchange-traded funds (ETFs) when he developed a structure under which ETFs are offered as a separate share class of existing Vanguard index funds.&lt;ref name="press release"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=New Vanguard Vipers Put A New Twist On ETFs With Separate Share Classes|url= http://www.etf.com/publications/journalofindexes/joi-news/1630.html?nopaging=1|publisher=Etf.com|date=October 1, 2003| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221002192752/https://www.etf.com/publications/journalofindexes/joi-news/1630.html?nopaging=1| archive-date=October 2, 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vanguard patented this structure in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.google.com/patents/US6879964| title=Investment company that issues a class of conventional shares and a class of exchange-traded shares in the same fund|  publisher=Google Patents| accessdate=April 23, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sauter announced his retirement, effective December 31, 2012, on June 22, 2012.&lt;ref name="press release"/&gt;

===Professional advisory and committee roles===
During his career, Sauter served on the advisory board of the Journal of Investment Management Conference Series, the Journal of Indexes Editorial Board, the Investor Advisory Group of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, and the Council on the Graduate School of Business of The University of Chicago.

He served as a member of the equity markets committee of the Investment Company Institute, the Institutional Traders Advisory Committee of the New York Stock Exchange, and the Nasdaq Quality of Markets Committee. He also has served on the trading committee of the Securities Industry Association, Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA), and the AIMR Best Execution Task Force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.sec.gov/spotlight/marketstructure/marketstructurebios.htm| title=Market Structure Roundtable - Panelists' Biographies| publisher=SEC| date=June 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''mutual fund turnover ratio''' is a measure of how often fund managers buy and sell assets within a [[mutual fund]]. Fund turnover affects fund trading costs, and can also impact capital gains distributions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=John Bogle| author-link=John Bogle| date=January–February 2014| title=The Arithmetic of "All-In" Investment Expenses| url=https://johncbogle.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/FAJ-All-In-Investment-Expenses-Jan-Feb-2014.pdf| work=Financial Analysts Journal Volume 70 (1)| publisher=CFA Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Calculation==
The ratio is calculated by taking either the total amount of new securities purchased or the amount of securities sold - whichever is less - over a particular period, divided by the average net assets of the fund.

===Example===
The Vanguard Total International Index fund reports the following purchases and sales of stock during the 2017 fiscal year. In-kind purchases and sales are not included in the turnover calculation. In this calculation, portfolio sales, being the lesser transaction, is used as the numerator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/736054/000093247117006098/star_final.htm| title=Vanguard STAR funds 2017 annual report for SEC filing| publisher=EDGAR| accessdate=July 2, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/736054/000093247117006112/0000932471-17-006112.txt| title=2017 NSAR report - Average Net Assets| publisher=EDGAR| accessdate=July 2, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text bytes="2630" sha1="cye6bryjl1ucnp43k3eo8jh88x6wv5y" xml:space="preserve">'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is the process of adjusting an open-end [[mutual fund]]’s [[net asset value]] (“NAV”) per share to pass on to purchasing or redeeming shareholders certain of the costs associated with their trading activity. It is designed to protect existing shareholders from dilution associated with shareholder purchases and redemptions, and is another tool to help funds manage liquidity risks.

The Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) adopted the rule on October 16, 2016, but implementation of the rule was delayed until amendments (Form N-1A and Regulation S-X) were finalized on November 19, 2018.&lt;ref name="SEC"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.sec.gov/resources-small-businesses/small-business-compliance-guides/investment-company-swing-pricing| title=Investment Company Swing Pricing| publisher=SEC| date=October 12, 2017| accessdate=July 9, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt; Swing pricing does not apply to [[closed-end funds]] or [[exchange-traded fund]]s.

Fund providers use swing pricing if a fund's net inflows or outflows exceed a provider's preset level. In all instances, the provider calculates the NAV as normal before adjusting it by the designated swing factor.

In executing swing pricing, a fund provider has two options: full swing pricing or partial swing pricing. Under full swing pricing, the NAV is adjusted every dealing date, regardless of the amount of shareholder activity. Under partial swing pricing, the daily shareholder activity is compared to a predetermined swing threshold.

==Example==
ABC Fund has a price of $30 per share and the fund's provider sets a swing factor of 0.1% of the NAV for net flows above or below 5% of the prior day’s price. If the fund experiences a net inflow of 10% of NAV, the price of the fund would be adjusted upward to $30.03 ($30 + ($30 &amp;times; 0.1%)). The same situation would occur with a 10% outflow except that the price would be adjusted downward to $29.97. If a net flow of less than 10% occurs, swing pricing is not implemented and the fund’s price remains at $30.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.mutualfunds.com/education/what-is-swing-pricing-for-mutual-funds/| title=What Is Swing Pricing for Mutual Funds?| publisher=MutualFunds| date=May 16, 2017| accessdate=July 9, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Investors who want a simple [[asset allocation]] portfolio often use a '''two-fund portfolio'''. This consists of one equity [[index fund]] and one fixed income fund. The fund selections can vary depending on asset class (global equity or domestic equity, and bond type), and asset type ([[Mutual fund|mutual fund]], [[exchange-traded fund]] (ETF), and [[Collective investment trust|collective investment trust]] (CIT)).

==Global two-fund portfolios==
[[Rick Ferri]] has proposed a [[Lazy portfolios#Two fund portfolio|two-fund portfolio]] consisting of the following asset classes:
* A global stock market index fund/ETF
* A US intermediate term bond index fund/ETF

He suggests a US total market bond index fund/ETF for the fixed income selection. However, you can substitute a global bond index fund/ETF, a US intermediate-term bond index fund/ETF, a US intermediate-term [[treasury bond]] index fund/ETF, or a US [[Municipal bonds|municipal bond]] index fund/ETF for the fixed income allocation. You may also find that employer-provided retirement plans will use collective investment trusts as investment vehicles.

You can adjust Rick Ferri's two-fund portfolio to reflect any stock/bond allocation. The charts below show suggestions for different asset allocations.

&lt;center&gt;'''Global two-fund portfolio allocations'''&lt;/center&gt;

File:40 60.png|40/60 allocation
File:20 80.png|20/80 allocation
&lt;/gallery&gt;

==US-only two-fund portfolios== 
Both [[John Bogle]] and Warren Buffett have recommended portfolios for investors who want to invest in US domestic stocks and bonds. 

===John Bogle's two-fund portfolio===
[[John Bogle]] has often suggested that an investor can use one total US stock market index fund and one total US bond index fund.{{#tag:ref|In chapter 18 of ''The Little Book Of Common Sense Investing'', [[John Bogle]] wrote:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=The Little Book of Common Sense Investing| chapter=Chapter 18 - What Should I Do Now?| author=John Bogle| author-link=John Bogle| date=2007| isbn=978-0-470-10210-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Blockquote|Deep down, I remain absolutely confident that the vast majority of American families will be well served by owning their equity holdings in an all-U.S. stock-market index portfolio and holding their bonds in an all-U.S. bond-market index portfolio. (Investors in high tax brackets, however, would hold a very low-cost quasi-index portfolio of high-grade intermediate-term municipal bonds.)...}}|group="note"}} He has also suggested that an intermediate-term bond index fund, or a low-cost intermediate municipal bond fund can be used for fixed income allocations. You can allocate the portfolio in various stock/bond allocations, as shown in the charts below.

File:20 80 Bogle two-fund portfolio.png|John Bogle 20/80 allocation 
&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Warren Buffett's two-fund portfolio===
[[File:Buffett two-fund portfolio.png|150px|thumb|Warren Buffett's two-fund portfolio]]
Warren Buffett has suggested a two-fund portfolio consisting of a 90% allocation to an [[S&amp;P 500 index|S&amp;P 500]] index fund and a 10% allocation to [[treasury bills]].{{#tag:ref|In his 2013 letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders, Warren Buffett wrote:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/2013ltr.pdf| title=2013 Letter to the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc| author=Warren Buffett| date=February 28, 2014| accessdate=June 8, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Blockquote|What I advise here is essentially identical to certain instructions I’ve laid out in my will. One bequest provides that cash will be delivered to a trustee for my wife’s benefit. (I have to use cash for individual bequests, because all of my Berkshire shares will be fully distributed to certain philanthropic organizations over the ten years following the closing of my estate.) My advice to the trustee could not be more simple: Put 10% of the cash in short-term government bonds and 90% in a very low-cost S&amp;P 500 index fund. (I suggest Vanguard’s.) I believe the trust’s long-term results from this policy will be superior to those attained by most investors – whether pension funds, institutions or individuals – who employ high-fee managers.}}|group="note"}}

You can purchase treasury bills in a brokerage (or Treasury Direct) account, where investors tender a noncompetitive bid at auction. You can also use a treasury money market fund, or an ETF investing in 1 to 3 month bills for access to the treasury bill market. 

However, you are free to substitute an intermediate bond fund (total bond, intermediate bond, treasury bond, or municipal bond) for the t-bill allocation if desirable. Many employer-provided retirement plans offer S&amp;P 500 index funds or collective investment trusts.

You can also choose to allocate the Buffett two-fund portfolio to various stock/bond allocations.

==One balanced index fund portfolio==
You can also build a two-fund portfolio by investing in a single [[Balanced fund|balanced]] index fund. For example, [[Vanguard]], [[Fidelity]], and [[Schwab|Charles Schwab]] offer [[Target date retirement funds|target date retirement index funds]] that provide access to global stocks and intermediate bonds. Vanguard also offers global target risk balanced index funds (the [[LifeStrategy]] funds). Vanguard's funds provide access to both global stocks and global bonds. Fidelity and Schwab's target date offerings provide access to global stocks and US bonds.

Vanguard offers a US Balanced Index Fund, consisting of a 60/40 stock/bond allocation using a total US stock market index allocation and a total US bond market index allocation.

Because of [[Tax-efficient fund placement#Tax efficiency of balanced funds| tax implications]], it is often recommended that balanced index funds are used in tax-deferred and tax-free investment accounts.

In investing, we make personal choices about how much [[Risk and return: an introduction|risk]] we are willing to take if we think we can get higher return in exchange. '''{{PAGENAME}}''' compares historical performance of similar funds that are appropriate for [[short-term]] savings.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt; John Bogle, in his 1994 classic, ''Bogle on Mutual Funds'', suggested using a low-cost short-term treasury bond fund, with its government backed credit rating, as a prudent substitute for a money market fund for investment reserves distinct from savings and transaction account balances. (p.132 in the text)&lt;/ref&gt;

Volatility--fluctuations in value--are an important aspect of risk. In financial economics, volatility is often measured by a statistical value called the [[wikipedia:Standard deviation| standard deviation]], represented by the Greek letter ''sigma'' (σ). The standard deviation of mutual funds can be found on sites like [http://www.morningstar.com Morningstar] or [https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/fund-performance PortfolioVisualizer]. However, it is hard to relate this number to a practical question, like "how much risk would I be taking by putting money I need a year from now into a short-term bond fund instead of a money market fund?" This article tries to help with this kind of question.

==Overview==
In this article, we calculate some other measures of risk by calculating what would have happened to an investment of $10,000, held for short periods of time, in a [[mutual fund]] or [[exchange-traded fund]] (ETF). You might do this in hope of making more than you would have made in a money market mutual fund, and accepting the possibility of sometimes making less.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt; For funds and ETFs, calculations are based on data made publicly available free of charge from [https://www.morningstar.com/ Morningstar]. Data for the CPI is CPI-U, "CPI for All Urban Consumers," not seasonally adjusted, obtained from the [https://www.bls.gov/ Bureau of Labor Statistics].&lt;/ref&gt; The possibility of making less is depicted in two ways:

1) What ''percentage'' of the time would you have made less than in a money market fund? We chose VMMXX, the Vanguard Prime Money Market Fund, because it is one of the oldest money market fund and gave us a long period of comparison. We also show what percentage of the time you would have actually lost money--ended up with less than $10,000 at the end of the time period--and what percentage of time you would have failed to keep up with inflation.

2) It's important to know not just when a fund or ETF underperformed a money market mutual fund, but by how much. In the case of short-term funds, the losses, when they did occur, were so small that some might call them negligible To quantify this, we present two numbers. One is the average loss that occurred ''in those periods in which losses did occur;'' and the other is the largest loss that ever occurred within the body of data that was used.

Notice that a high probability of underperforming may not be important at all. If two investments have the same return and volatility, but just fluctuate randomly with respect to each other, you would expect each of them to underperform the other about 50% of the time. 

We have chosen to present data going back for as far as Morningstar has data. As a result, there are two caveats. First, the data range shown for each fund is different and results for different funds cannot be directly compared. For example, the Vanguard Short-Term Treasury Fund, VFISX, beat VMMXX by an average of $117.10 while the Vanguard Short-Term Treasury ''Index'' fund, VGSH, only beat it by $33.17. But this is almost entirely due to VGSH's inception in 2009 versus VFISX's inception in 1991. If we restrict our view of VFISX to the same years as VGSH, the benefit for VFISX was only $44.05. Second, this underlines the problem with all historical data, which is that the present time--and thus the short-term future--may be quite different from the historical averages.

===Median and average (mean)===
We show both the average and the median for some key values. A reader requested this. We have a scattered group of values: the return from an investment over many different periods of time. To represent the center of such a group with a single number, we often calculate and average or mean. In the case here, when we are looking, for example, at losses, and only seeing "the tail of the distribution," the average may give the wrong impression because it's influenced by extreme values. The median is another measure, and represents the value that is halfway based on counting. If the median loss of an investment is $600, it means you had a 50% chance of losing more over $600 and a 50% chance of losing less than $600.

===Holding bond funds for the average "duration" of the fund===
A "duration" is a calculation based on bond math that gives a number of years, related to the bond's term but shorter. One interpretation of the duration is that it is the "point of indifference." It is too well known that when interest rates rise, bond values fall. What is less well known is that if a bond is held for its duration, at the end of that period of time it will have the same value regardless of what interest rates do, provided the yield curve moves in parallel. This does not apply to a bond ''fund'' because the bonds in a fund are all different "ages" at any given time, and because the yield curve doesn't move in parallel. So there are no guarantees, but, nevertheless, the duration tells us a holding period over which the fund is unlikely to lose money.

This leads us to expect, for example, that "short-term" bond funds--like the Vanguard Short-Term Bond Index Fund, with a duration of 2.7 years--will sometimes lose money over periods of 6 or 12 months, but rarely lose money over periods of 5 years. This expectation is borne out by history.

A bond fund may not lose money, in the sense of dollars, yet lose value to inflation.

In investing, we make personal choices about how much [[Risk and return: an introduction|risk]] we are willing to take if we think we can get higher return in exchange. '''{{PAGENAME}}''' compares historical performance of similar funds that are appropriate for [[short-term]] savings.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt; John Bogle, in his 1994 classic, ''Bogle on Mutual Funds'', suggested using a low-cost short-term treasury bond fund, with its government backed credit rating, as a prudent substitute for a money market fund for investment reserves distinct from savings and transaction account balances. (p.132 in the text)&lt;/ref&gt;

Volatility--fluctuations in value--are an important aspect of risk. In financial economics, volatility is often measured by a statistical value called the [[wikipedia:Standard deviation| standard deviation]], represented by the Greek letter ''sigma'' (σ). The standard deviation of mutual funds can be found on sites like [http://www.morningstar.com Morningstar] or [https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/fund-performance PortfolioVisualizer]. However, it is hard to relate this number to a practical question, like "how much risk would I be taking by putting money I need a year from now into a short-term bond fund instead of a money market fund?" This article tries to help with this kind of question.

==Overview==
In this article, we calculate some other measures of risk by calculating what would have happened to an investment of $10,000, held for short periods of time, in a [[mutual fund]] or [[exchange-traded fund]] (ETF). You might do this in hope of making more than you would have made in a money market mutual fund, and accepting the possibility of sometimes making less.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt; For funds and ETFs, calculations are based on data made publicly available free of charge from [https://www.morningstar.com/ Morningstar]. Data for the CPI is CPI-U, "CPI for All Urban Consumers," not seasonally adjusted, obtained from the [https://www.bls.gov/ Bureau of Labor Statistics].&lt;/ref&gt; The possibility of making less is depicted in two ways:

1) What ''percentage'' of the time would you have made less than in a money market fund? We chose VMMXX, the Vanguard Prime Money Market Fund, because it is one of the oldest money market fund and gave us a long period of comparison. We also show what percentage of the time you would have actually lost money--ended up with less than $10,000 at the end of the time period--and what percentage of time you would have failed to keep up with inflation.

2) It's important to know not just when a fund or ETF underperformed a money market mutual fund, but by how much. In the case of short-term funds, the losses, when they did occur, were so small that some might call them negligible To quantify this, we present two numbers. One is the average loss that occurred ''in those periods in which losses did occur;'' and the other is the largest loss that ever occurred within the body of data that was used.

Notice that a high probability of underperforming may not be important at all. If two investments have the same return and volatility, but just fluctuate randomly with respect to each other, you would expect each of them to underperform the other about 50% of the time. 

We have chosen to present data going back for as far as Morningstar has data. As a result, there are two caveats. First, the data range shown for each fund is different and results for different funds cannot be directly compared. For example, the Vanguard Short-Term Treasury Fund, VFISX, beat VMMXX by an average of $117.10 while the Vanguard Short-Term Treasury ''Index'' fund, VGSH, only beat it by $33.17. But this is almost entirely due to VGSH's inception in 2009 versus VFISX's inception in 1991. If we restrict our view of VFISX to the same years as VGSH, the benefit for VFISX was only $44.05. Second, this underlines the problem with all historical data, which is that the present time--and thus the short-term future--may be quite different from the historical averages.

===Median and average (mean)===
We show both the average and the median for some key values. A reader requested this. We have a scattered group of values: the return from an investment over many different periods of time. To represent the center of such a group with a single number, we often calculate and average or mean. In the case here, when we are looking, for example, at losses, and only seeing "the tail of the distribution," the average may give the wrong impression because it's influenced by extreme values. The median is another measure, and represents the value that is halfway based on counting. If the median loss of an investment is $600, it means you had a 50% chance of losing more over $600 and a 50% chance of losing less than $600.

===Holding bond funds for the average "duration" of the fund===
A "duration" is a calculation based on bond math that gives a number of years, related to the bond's term but shorter. One interpretation of the duration is that it is the "point of indifference." It is too well known that when interest rates rise, bond values fall. What is less well known is that if a bond is held for its duration, at the end of that period of time it will have the same value regardless of what interest rates do, provided the yield curve moves in parallel. This does not apply to a bond ''fund'' because the bonds in a fund are all different "ages" at any given time, and because the yield curve doesn't move in parallel. So there are no guarantees, but, nevertheless, the duration tells us a holding period over which the fund is unlikely to lose money.

This leads us to expect, for example, that "short-term" bond funds--like the Vanguard Short-Term Bond Index Fund, with a duration of 2.7 years--will sometimes lose money over periods of 6 or 12 months, but rarely lose money over periods of 5 years. This expectation is borne out by history.

A bond fund may not lose money, in the sense of dollars, yet lose value to inflation.

In investing, we make personal choices about how much [[Risk and return: an introduction|risk]] we are willing to take if we think we can get higher return in exchange. '''{{PAGENAME}}''' compares historical performance of similar funds that are appropriate for [[short-term]] savings.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt; John Bogle, in his 1994 classic, ''Bogle on Mutual Funds'', suggested using a low-cost short-term treasury bond fund, with its government backed credit rating, as a prudent substitute for a money market fund for investment reserves distinct from savings and transaction account balances. (p.132 in the text)&lt;/ref&gt;

Volatility--fluctuations in value--are an important aspect of risk. In financial economics, volatility is often measured by a statistical value called the [[wikipedia:Standard deviation| standard deviation]], represented by the Greek letter ''sigma'' (σ). The standard deviation of mutual funds can be found on sites like [http://www.morningstar.com Morningstar] or [https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/fund-performance PortfolioVisualizer]. However, it is hard to relate this number to a practical question, like "how much risk would I be taking by putting money I need a year from now into a short-term bond fund instead of a money market fund?" This article tries to help with this kind of question.

==Overview==
In this article, we calculate some other measures of risk by calculating what would have happened to an investment of $10,000, held for short periods of time, in a [[mutual fund]] or [[exchange-traded fund]] (ETF). You might do this in hope of making more than you would have made in a money market mutual fund, and accepting the possibility of sometimes making less.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt; For funds and ETFs, calculations are based on data made publicly available free of charge from [https://www.morningstar.com/ Morningstar]. Data for the CPI is CPI-U, "CPI for All Urban Consumers," not seasonally adjusted, obtained from the [https://www.bls.gov/ Bureau of Labor Statistics].&lt;/ref&gt; The possibility of making less is depicted in two ways:

1) What ''percentage'' of the time would you have made less than in a money market fund? We chose VMMXX, the Vanguard Prime Money Market Fund, because it is one of the oldest money market fund and gave us a long period of comparison. We also show what percentage of the time you would have actually lost money--ended up with less than $10,000 at the end of the time period--and what percentage of time you would have failed to keep up with inflation.

2) It's important to know not just when a fund or ETF underperformed a money market mutual fund, but by how much. In the case of short-term funds, the losses, when they did occur, were so small that some might call them negligible To quantify this, we present two numbers. One is the average loss that occurred ''in those periods in which losses did occur;'' and the other is the largest loss that ever occurred within the body of data that was used.

Notice that a high probability of underperforming may not be important at all. If two investments have the same return and volatility, but just fluctuate randomly with respect to each other, you would expect each of them to underperform the other about 50% of the time. 

We have chosen to present data going back for as far as Morningstar has data. As a result, there are two caveats. First, the data range shown for each fund is different and results for different funds cannot be directly compared. For example, the Vanguard Short-Term Treasury Fund, VFISX, beat VMMXX by an average of $117.10 while the Vanguard Short-Term Treasury ''Index'' fund, VGSH, only beat it by $33.17. But this is almost entirely due to VGSH's inception in 2009 versus VFISX's inception in 1991. If we restrict our view of VFISX to the same years as VGSH, the benefit for VFISX was only $44.05. Second, this underlines the problem with all historical data, which is that the present time--and thus the short-term future--may be quite different from the historical averages.

===Median and average (mean)===
We show both the average and the median for some key values. A reader requested this. We have a scattered group of values: the return from an investment over many different periods of time. To represent the center of such a group with a single number, we often calculate and average or mean. In the case here, when we are looking, for example, at losses, and only seeing "the tail of the distribution," the average may give the wrong impression because it's influenced by extreme values. The median is another measure, and represents the value that is halfway based on counting. If the median loss of an investment is $600, it means you had a 50% chance of losing more over $600 and a 50% chance of losing less than $600.

===Holding bond funds for the average "duration" of the fund===
A "duration" is a calculation based on bond math that gives a number of years, related to the bond's term but shorter. One interpretation of the duration is that it is the "point of indifference." It is too well known that when interest rates rise, bond values fall. What is less well known is that if a bond is held for its duration, at the end of that period of time it will have the same value regardless of what interest rates do, provided the yield curve moves in parallel. This does not apply to a bond ''fund'' because the bonds in a fund are all different "ages" at any given time, and because the yield curve doesn't move in parallel. So there are no guarantees, but, nevertheless, the duration tells us a holding period over which the fund is unlikely to lose money.

This leads us to expect, for example, that "short-term" bond funds--like the Vanguard Short-Term Bond Index Fund, with a duration of 2.7 years--will sometimes lose money over periods of 6 or 12 months, but rarely lose money over periods of 5 years. This expectation is borne out by history.

A bond fund may not lose money, in the sense of dollars, yet lose value to inflation.

===Holding stocks "for five years"===
Authorities advice against using stocks for money you will need in less than five years; '''Vanguard says ten.''' If you are considering using stocks for money you will need in five years, then you should familiarize yourself with the data for stocks held for five years. See [[Using mutual funds and ETFs for short-term savings (5 years)]]. 

Vanguard itself puts all of it stock funds in risk categories 4 and 5 and says "these funds may be appropriate for investors who have a long-term investment horizon '''(10 years or longer).'''" 

A few other authorities say:

"Do not invest any money in stocks you will need in less than five years.”—William J. Bernstein, ''The Four Pillars of Investing''.

“A rule of thumb in investing is that you should not invest money in stocks or stock funds that you will need in less than five years.”—Jack Brennan and Marta McCave, “Straight Talk on Investing.” 

“Owning stocks for the short term (less than five years) is foolish.”—''Kiplinger’s Personal Finance'', Nov, 2004.  

“Money you know you will need in the five to 10 years does not belong in stocks.”—Suze Orman, ''Suze Orman’s Action Plan''. 

Even Jim Cramer has said “If you need the money for something serious in the next four years, you cannot risk keeping it in stocks.”--Jim Cramer, ''Getting Back to Even''.

This article provides a comparison of core '''mutual funds''' for use in [[Bogleheads investment philosophy|Boglehead-style]] investing. While the choices for [[mutual fund|mutual funds]] depend on the brokerage you use, most modern brokerages offer access to low-cost [[index fund|index mutual funds]], and commission-free access to all [[ETFs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/13/battle-for-client-assets-heats-up-as-brokers-cut-fees-to-zero.html|title=Battle for client assets heats up as brokers cut fees to zero|publisher=CNBC|date=October 13, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; When choosing between [[mutual fund|mutual funds]], the [[expense ratio]] (ER) is an important consideration. This page offers a condensed menu of low-expense-ratio funds that are commonly used as core holdings in the construction of [[lazy portfolios|passive — or "lazy" — portfolios]]. Funds available at each brokerage are compared below.

==Mutual funds at Charles Schwab==
{{main|Charles Schwab}} 
Charles Schwab manages its own index mutual funds. As a broker, Schwab also provides access to other firm's mutual funds, but they are usually subject to transaction fees (unless the fund is a part of the no-transaction-fee network). {{trim|{{Schwab mutual funds}}}}
All ETFs are commission-free at Schwab, enabling use of low-cost index ETFs. See the [[ETFs for Bogleheads]] article for a comparison of core ETFs.

      <text bytes="14645" sha1="qraajbh0ag5mylq7kgr230uocyd1tn2" xml:space="preserve">'''"{{PAGENAMEBASE}}'''" shows how high [[Expense ratio|expense ratios]] can significantly reduce the amount of money you have in your portfolio. The longer you hold onto funds with high expense ratios, the less money you will have for retirement.

The math works the same way for financial advisors who charge an Asset Under Management (AUM) fee. Whether you have an advisor who charges a 1% AUM fee, or a fund which has a 1% expense ratio, the effect on your portfolio is the same.

==Percentages lost to annual fees==
Stated more precisely:

*Assume that you buy an investment and do not touch it for &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; years. In other words, you do a "lump-sum" investment.
* Assume that the investment has an annual fee &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, expressed as a percentage. For example, a mutual fund might have an annual fee (an expense ratio) of 1%.
*Assume that the annual fee is taken once per year, at the end of each year. This assumption is a simplification. For example, in reality, a mutual fund calculates its annual fee as a daily fee.
*Temporarily imagine that the annual fee is zero and that your investment grows for &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; years. The final value of your investment---consider it as "100%."
*What percentage of your investment do you lose to annual fees? The answer is &lt;math&gt;1 - (1 - f)^{n}&lt;/math&gt;.

Later, we will prove the above formula. First, see the following table and examples.

'''Example''': If you buy an investment with an annual fee of 0.10%, and do not touch the investment for 40 years, you lose 4% to annual fees.

*The above percentage agrees with a result from user "Lobster," who started the following thread on [https://www.bogleheads.org/ Bogleheads] on 2017-04-20: [https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&amp;t=217026 Visualizing the devastating impact of fees]. User "Lobster" linked to a [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e84iEblhPhdtWuOCR25v1M96ug6IHwGU8FelxJ8M-vY/edit#gid=1654711040 Google Sheets spreadsheet] which has a column chart and which has a percentage of 3.92%.
*Note that &lt;math&gt;3.92% = 1 - (1 - 0.10%)^{40}&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Example''': If you buy an investment with an annual fee of 2%, and do not touch the investment for 10 years, you lose 18% to annual fees.
* The above percentage agrees with a result from Mr. Richard A. Howard, on his web site [https://buyupside.com/calculators/feesdec07.htm buyupside]. We boldface the important text:
:{{quotation|Assume that you invested $10,000, held it for '''10 years''' at a 6 percent annual rate of return. Paying no fees, you would have $17,908.48. '''With a two percent annual fee,''' you would have $14,632.53, '''an 18.29 percent reduction''' due to fees.}}
*Note that &lt;math&gt;18.29% = 1 - (1 - 2%)^{10}&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Example''': If you buy an investment with an annual fee of 2%, and do not touch the investment for 30 years, you lose 45% to annual fees.
*The above percentage agrees with a result from Mr. Richard A. Howard, on his web site [https://buyupside.com/calculators/feesdec07.htm buyupside]. We boldface the important text:
:{{quotation|Now take the same $10,000 and hold it for '''30 years''' at 6 percent return. With no fees, you would have $57,434.91. '''With a two percent annual fee,''' you would accumulate $31,329.84, '''a 45.45 percent reduction.''' So the two percent annual fee cut your total return almost in half!}}
*Note that &lt;math&gt;45.45% = 1 - (1 - 2%)^{30}&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Example''': If you buy an investment with an annual fee of 2%, and do not touch the investment for 50 years, you lose 64% to annual fees.
*The above percentage agrees approximately with a result from Mr. John ("Jack") C. Bogle, the founder of [https://about.vanguard.com/ Vanguard], in an [https://www.cfr.org/event/conversation-john-c-bogle interview] on 2017-11-28. We boldface the important text:
:{{quotation|And so if you’re in the market for a lifetime, and you earn a—don’t hold me to this—I think I just did maybe '''50 years.''' And you earn, let’s say, a 7 percent return, you’ll end up with, say, $30 per dollar, something like that, invested. And if you do it and earn 5 percent, that’s the 7 percent in the market, less than '''2 percent playing the game,''' you end up with $10. So '''you’ve given up two-thirds of your return'''—$30 versus $10.}}
*Note that &lt;math&gt;64% = 1 - (1 - 2%)^{50}&lt;/math&gt;.

The following examples do not use the above table, but they use the formula which we mentioned earlier.

'''Example''': If you buy an investment with an annual fee of 2%, and do not touch the investment for 25 years, you lose 40% to annual fees.
*The above percentage agrees with a result from [https://about.vanguard.com/ Vanguard] on their web page [https://investor.vanguard.com/investing/how-to-invest/impact-of-costs Don't let high costs eat away your returns]. We boldface the important text:
:{{quotation|Imagine you have $100,000 invested. If the account earned 6% a year for the next '''25 years''' and had no costs or fees, you'd end up with about $430,000. If, on the other hand, you paid 2% a year in costs, after 25 years you'd only have about $260,000. That's right: '''The 2% you paid every year would wipe out almost 40% of your final account value.''' 2% doesn't sound so small anymore, does it?}}
*Note that &lt;math&gt;40% = 1 - (1 - 2%)^{25}&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Example''': If you buy an investment with an annual fee of 2.5%, and do not touch the investment for 65 years, you lose 81% to annual fees.
*The above percentage agrees approximately with a result from Mr. John ("Jack") C. Bogle, the founder of [https://about.vanguard.com/ Vanguard], in an [https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/retirement/interviews/bogle.html interview] on 2006-02-07 with the documentary program [https://www.pbs.org/show/frontline/ Frontline]. We boldface the important text:
:{{quotation|If you invest $1,000 at the beginning of that time and earn 8 percent, that $1,000 will grow in that '''65-year period''' to around $140,000. Now, '''the financial system''' -- the mutual fund system in this case -- '''will take about two and a half percentage points''' out of that return, so you will have a gross return of 8 percent, a net return of 5.5 percent, and your $1,000 will grow to approximately $30,000. One hundred ten thousand dollars goes to the financial system and $30,000 to you, the investor. Think about that. That means '''the financial system''' put up zero percent of the capital and took zero percent of the risk and '''got almost 80 percent of the return,''' and you, the investor in this long time period, an investment lifetime, put up 100 percent of the capital, took 100 percent of the risk, and got only a little bit over 20 percent of the return.}}
*Note that &lt;math&gt;81% = 1 - (1 - 2.5%)^{65}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Formula proof==

Below, we prove the formula which we mentioned earlier.

* Assume that you buy an investment and do not touch it for &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; years.
*Assume that the investment has an annual fee &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, expressed as a percentage.
*Assume that the annual fee is taken once per year, at the end of each year.
*Temporarily imagine that the annual fee is zero and that your investment grows for &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; years. The final value of your investment---consider it as "100%."
*What percentage of your investment do you lose to annual fees? The answer is &lt;math&gt;1 - (1 - f)^{n}&lt;/math&gt;.

Proof.

*Let &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; be your principal at the start of year 1.

*Let &lt;math&gt;r_{i}&lt;/math&gt; be the investment's annual return in year &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;.

* At the end of year 1, you will have &lt;math&gt;P(1 + r_{1})(1 - f).&lt;/math&gt;

*At the end of year 2, you will have &lt;math&gt;P(1 + r_{1})(1 - f) \times (1 + r_{2})(1 - f).&lt;/math&gt;

*At the end of year 3, you will have &lt;math&gt;P(1 + r_{1})(1 - f) \times (1 + r_{2})(1 - f) \times (1 + r_{3})(1 - f).&lt;/math&gt;

*At the end of year &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, you will have &lt;math&gt;P(1 + r_{1})(1 - f) \times (1 + r_{2})(1 - f) \times (1 + r_{3})(1 - f) \times \cdots \times (1 + r_{n})(1 - f).&lt;/math&gt;
*Let &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; be the last value above. &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; stands for "investment value."

*Temporarily imagine that the annual fee is zero: &lt;math&gt;f = 0&lt;/math&gt;. Substitute this into the expression for &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;, getting &lt;math&gt;P(1 - r_{1})(1 - r_{2})(1 - r_{3}) ... (1 - r_{n})&lt;/math&gt;.
*Let &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; be the last value above. &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; stands for "max value of investment." Assume that &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is not zero. Later, we will divide by &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;.

*Note that &lt;math&gt;I/M = (1 - f)(1 - f)(1 - f) ... (1 - f) = (1 - f)^{n}.&lt;/math&gt; This is the percentage of your investment that you keep.

*Therefore the percentage of your investment that you lose to annual fees is &lt;math&gt;1 - I/M = 1 - (1 - f)^{n}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Generalized formula== 

We can generalize our above formula. We allow the years to have possibly different annual fees. The formula statement becomes:

*...
*Assume that the investment has &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; annual fees &lt;math&gt;f_{1}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f_{2}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f_{3}&lt;/math&gt;, ..., &lt;math&gt;f_{n}&lt;/math&gt;, where each fee is a percentage.
*...
*What percentage of your investment do you lose to annual fees? The answer is &lt;math&gt;1 - (1 - f_{1})(1 - f_{2})(1 - f_{3}) ... (1 - f_{n})&lt;/math&gt;.

The proof of the generalized formula is similar to the proof of the original formula.

On 2011-10-28, in the Vanguard blog post [https://web.archive.org/web/20161110064941/http://vanguardblog.com/2011/10/28/stopping-the-silent-killer-of-returns/ Stopping the silent killer of returns], Dr. John Ameriks posted a table, which we recreate below. Most of his values agree with ours, if we ignore the minus signs. However, he used a different formula: &lt;math&gt;1-(1+c)^{-T}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is an annual fee (possibly "c" stands for "cost"), and &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is the number of years (possibly "T" stands for "time"). This formula is discussed in a thread on [https://www.bogleheads.org/ Bogleheads] which was started by user "Lobster" on 2017-04-20: [https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&amp;t=217026 Visualizing the devastating impact of fees]. In that thread, users "Kevin M" and "#Cruncher" ("number cruncher") think that this formula is related to how mutual funds calculate the annual fee as a daily fee.

It consists of global stocks and bonds, held in [[Free-float methodology|free-float]] market proportions.&lt;ref name=RISMAT-7&gt;{{Cite web|author=William F. Sharpe|title=Retirement Income Scenario Matrices 7. The Market Portfolio|url=https://web.stanford.edu/~wfsharpe/RISMAT/RISMAT-7.pdf|publisher=Stanford University (Creative Commons)|accessdate=June 16, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Components ==

There is currently no single retail fund that implements a World Bond/Stock (WBS) portfolio in the way described by Sharpe. To address this, he has suggested a four-fund proxy&lt;ref name=RISMAT-7/&gt;&lt;ref name=4-Fund-Proxy&gt;{{Cite web|author=William F. Sharpe|title=The Four-fund Proxy for the World Bond Stock Fund|url=https://retirementincomeanalysis.blogspot.com/2019/08/the-four-fund-proxy-for-wold-bond-stock.html|date=August 2019|accessdate=June 16, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also a two-fund proxy&lt;ref name=2-Fund-Proxy&gt;{{Cite web|author=William F. Sharpe|title=A Two-fund Proxy for the World Bond Stock Fund|url=https://retirementincomeanalysis.blogspot.com/2019/09/a-two-fund-proxy-for-world-bond-stock.html|date=September 2019|accessdate=June 16, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt; for WBS consisting of established Vanguard index funds.

A four-fund proxy for WBS consists of:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Component fund !! Asset class
|-
| VTSAX (or VTI) || US stocks
|-
| VTIAX (or VXUS) || Ex-US stocks
|-
| VBTLX (or BND) || USD bonds
|-
| VTABX (or BNDX)  || Ex-USD bonds
|-
|}

A two-fund proxy for WBS consists of:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Component fund !! Asset class
|-
| VT || Global stocks
|-
| BNDW || Global bonds
|-
|}

Of course, it is also possible to implement something similar with non-Vanguard funds.

== Allocations ==

The index funds used by the WBS proxies described above are held in proportion to their free-float market capitalization. That requires calculating the market capitalization of the index that each fund tracks. This is done by taking each index's market capitalization listed in its most recent factsheet, and then projecting that forward by the change in the fund's adjusted closing prices between the factsheet's publishing date and the current date.

&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{IndexMarketCap}_\mathrm{Current} = \mathrm{IndexMarketCap}_\mathrm{Factsheet} \times \frac{\mathrm{TrackingFundPrice}_\mathrm{Current}}{\mathrm{TrackingFundPrice}_{\mathrm{FactsheetDate}}}
&lt;/math&gt;

Note: VBTLX/BND, VTABX/BNDX, and BNDW track Bloomberg indices which do not publish their market capitalization numbers.  Sharpe has suggested that FTSE indexes (for example, WorldBIG) could substitute.&lt;ref name=RISMAT-7/&gt;&lt;ref name=4-Fund-Proxy/&gt;

=== Example ===

Here is an example of the allocation calculations as of June 15, 2025:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Component fund
! Asset class
! Tracked index
! Index factsheet market cap
! Index factsheet date
! Adjusted closing price on factsheet date
! Latest adjusted closing price (June 15, 2025)
! Projected market cap (June 15, 2025)
! Allocation (June 15, 2025)
|-
| VT
| Global stocks
| FTSE Global All Cap Index
| $90.42T
| May 30, 2025
| $123.37
| $124.95
| $91.58T
(= $90.42T * $124.95 / $123.37)
| 62.43%
(= $91.58T / ($55.08T + $91.58T))
|-
| BNDW
| Global bonds
| FTSE WorldBIG (substitute for Bloomberg index)
| $54.93T
| May 31, 2025
| $68.58
| $68.77
| $55.08T
(= $54.93T * $68.77 / $68.58)
| 37.57%
(= $55.08T / ($55.08T + $91.58T))
|-
|}

=== Current allocations ===

Here are the current allocations for the four-fund proxy, updated in real time:

|}

Here are the current allocations for the two-fund proxy, updated in real time:

{| border="1" style="border-collapse: collapse;
|-
|{{#widget:Google Spreadsheet
|key=2PACX-1vQShEGnLTHNk2_zgHWTiReXADEhmNvLR8SIaTsdGTdQJaa_F9ESrbo8bcsP0XEsVlBFtGEbjqUMO7g_

|}

Note: The total allocation to VTI and VXUS in the four-fund proxy might not precisely equal the VT allocation in the two-fund proxy. This is because VTI tracks a [[CRSP equity indexes|CRSP]] index which differs slightly from the [[FTSE Group|FTSE]] index that VT tracks.

== Rebalancing ==
{{See also|Rebalancing}}

The World Bond/Stock (WBS) portfolio holds each individual asset (that is, individual stock or bond) in proportion to its free-float market capitalization. Equivalently, it holds the same fraction of each asset’s free-float shares outstanding. That is, '''(shares held) / (free-float shares outstanding)''' is the same for every individual asset.

Framing WBS this way shows that rebalancing is needed only when an asset’s free-float supply changes the fraction of shares held (for example, new issuances, buybacks, or redemptions).

Conversely, events like price changes and dividend payments do ''not'' require rebalancing since they leave the fraction of shares held unchanged. As a result, WBS requires less frequent rebalancing than traditional fixed-weight portfolios (for example, a 60/40 stock/bond mix), which must rebalance whenever asset prices change.

If WBS assets are held through a ''single'' index fund, the fund handles rebalancing internally. But if assets are split across ''multiple funds'' (for example, stocks in VT and bonds in BNDW), their underlying free-float supply may change at different rates. This causes the share fractions held by the different funds to drift apart, requiring occasional manual rebalancing between the funds to realign them.

== Adjusting for personal circumstances ==

The World Bond/Stock portfolio mirrors the holdings of the average publicly invested portfolio, thereby taking on average investment risk and producing average return.&lt;ref name=Arithmetic&gt;{{Cite web|author=William F. Sharpe|title=The Arithmetic of Active Management|url=https://web.stanford.edu/~wfsharpe/art/active/active.htm|publisher=Association for Investment Management and Research|date=February 1991|accessdate=June 16, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt; This makes it a good default strategy.

Nevertheless, Sharpe notes that someone may justifiably deviate from this strategy to adjust for personal circumstances.&lt;ref name=Adjust&gt;{{Cite web|author=Charles Rotblut, William F. Sharpe|title=Allocate by Market Weight (And Adjust for Personal Circumstances)|url=https://www.aaii.com/files/PDF/9314_allocate-by-market-weight-and-adjust-for-personal-circumstances.pdf|publisher=American Association of Individual Investors|accessdate=June 16, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Adjustments discussed by Sharpe include:
* '''Adding a riskless asset.'''  For example, using certain inflation-adjusted investments (like [[Treasury Inflation Protected Security|TIPS]]) to cover a portion of real expenses.&lt;ref name=RISMAT-6&gt;{{Cite web|author=William F. Sharpe|title=Retirement Income Analysis with scenario matrices, Chapter 6. Inflation-Protected Investments|url=https://web.stanford.edu/~wfsharpe/RISMAT/RISMAT-6.pdf|publisher=Stanford University (Creative Commons)|accessdate=June 16, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Tilting asset allocations.''' For example, adjusting the stock/bond ratio to account for factors like [[Human capital|human capital]].&lt;ref name=Adjust/&gt;

=== Tilting using adaptive asset allocation ===

Sharpe proposes Adaptive Asset Allocation Policies, which allow asset class tilting while still remaining anchored to the dynamics of the WBS portfolio.&lt;ref name=AAAP&gt;{{Cite web|author=William F. Sharpe|title=Adaptive Asset Allocation Policies |url=https://web.stanford.edu/~wfsharpe/aaap/wfsaaap.pdf|publisher=Stanford University|accessdate=June 16, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt; This enables customization while continuously adapting to changes in the relative risk between asset classes.

It works as follows. Start with a desired initial allocation. Then update each asset class weight using:

&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{UpdatedWeight} = 
\mathrm{CurrentMarketWeight} \times
\frac{\mathrm{InitialDesiredWeight}}{\mathrm{InitialMarketWeight}}
&lt;/math&gt;

Finally, normalize the updated weights to get the new allocation.  For example:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Component fund
! Asset class
! Initial desired weight
! Initial market weight
! Current market weight
! Updated weight
! Normalized allocation
|-
| VT
| Global stocks
| 80%
| 60%
| 55%
| 73.33%
(= 55% * 80/60)
| 76.52%
(= 73.33 / (73.33 + 22.50))
|-
| BNDW
| Global bonds
| 20%
| 40%
| 45%
| 22.50%
(=45% * 20/40)
| 23.48%
(= 22.50 / (73.33 + 22.50))
|-

Both [[Vanguard target retirement funds|Vanguard Target Retirement Funds]] and [[Vanguard LifeStrategy Funds]] can be used as all-in-one portfolios. This article addresses the similarities and differences between the two series of funds.

{{Notice|Vanguard has an article about [https://personal.vanguard.com/us/content/Funds/FundsVanguardFundsLifeStrategyTargetCompare.jsp comparing Vanguard LifeStrategy Funds and Vanguard Target Retirement Funds]. In addition to what Vanguard already mentioned, you may consider the following.}}

==Minimum investment==
The target retirement funds have a minimum investment of $1,000 for opening an account; this makes it easier for small investors, just beginning their investment careers, to begin an investment program. The LifeStrategy funds have a higher $3,000 minimum investment requirement.

== Control over asset allocation ==
If you selected a target retirement fund based on its current asset allocation, not the target year, you may find that the fund shifts its asset allocation either too soon or too late. For example, suppose you plan to retire in 2030, but you think the 85% stocks 15% allocation in Vanguard Target Retirement 2030 Fund is too aggressive for your need, ability and willingness to take risk. Instead, you like the allocation in Vanguard Target Retirement 2015 Fund, which currently invests approximately 65% in stocks and 35% in bonds. If you invest in Target Retirement 2015, however, at some time close to 2015, the fund will shift its allocation more conservatively, while you are still at least 15 years away from your planned retirement. Or if you'd like to be more aggressive and invest in Target Retirement 2035 while you plan to retire in 2015, you may find the allocation in Target Retirement 2035 not shifting when you need a less aggressive allocation. 

If you invest in a LifeStrategy fund, this problem can be mitigated. You pick an allocation and change your allocation only when you want to. Alternatively, you can still invest in a Target Retirement fund but you have to watch for the allocation changes every year or every few years. If the allocation no longer suits you, switch to a different Target Retirement fund. This is best implemented in a tax deferred or tax free (Roth) account because there are no tax implications for switching. It somewhat defeats the "set it and forget it" appeal of a Target Retirement fund, but it's a good compromise between simplicity and maintaining your desired asset allocation.

== Short-term asset allocation swings ==
From inception in 1994 through the fourth quarter of 2011, all LifeStrategy funds had an allocation to Vanguard Asset Allocation Fund. The underlying asset allocation in Vanguard Asset Allocation Fund changed frequently in the short-term. This caused swings to the asset allocation of LifeStrategy funds. For example, when Vanguard Asset Allocation Fund changed from 60% in stocks to 100% in stocks, LifeStrategy Moderate Growth Fund's allocation also changed from 60% in stocks to 70% in stock.

Vanguard announced a revision in the LifeStragegy funds allocations in a September 30, 2011 web posting&lt;ref&gt;[https://personal.vanguard.com/us/insights/article/fund-announcementB-09302011 LifeStrategy Funds to adopt all-index approach]&lt;/ref&gt;  and instituted an additional change in 2013, adding [[Developed market bonds|international bonds]] to the portfolios.The new allocations  consist of four broad-based index funds:

*Vanguard Total Market Index Fund
*Vanguard Total International Index Fund
*Vanguard Total Bond Market II Index Fund
*Vanguard Total International Bond Index Fund

==Taxes ==
Historical data indicate that if you held the funds in a taxable account (not normally recommended for either one, but the simplicity may be worth the tax costs), the target retirement funds were slightly better options. The LifeStrategy funds held the Vanguard Asset Allocation Fund, which can realize capital gains as it changes its allocation. The revised post 2011 fund choices for the LifeStrategy funds will mean that the LifeStrategy funds can be expected to realize fewer short term and long term gains going forward.

==International allocation==
All target retirement funds and LifeStrategy funds have 40% of the fund's equity allocation in international stocks. The actual portfolio weighting of international stocks will depend on the overall strategic equity allocation of the fund (the range will fall between ~12% and ~36% international stock for target retirement funds&lt;ref&gt; See [[Vanguard target retirement funds#Detailed fund allocations]]&lt;/ref&gt;; and fall between 8% and 32% for the LifeStrategy funds&lt;ref&gt; See [[Vanguard LifeStrategy Funds#Fund allocations]]&lt;/ref&gt;.

The international bond fund represents 30% of the fixed income allocation of LifeStrategy and most target retirement funds. The Income and near-term Target Retirement funds (in the next 10 years) have slightly less international bond allocation due to an increasing allocation to short-term TIPS along the glide path&lt;ref&gt; See [[Glide paths#Target retirement funds glide paths]]&lt;/ref&gt;.

==[[Treasury Inflation Protected Security|TIPs]]==
Some target retirement funds (2020, 2015, and [https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/profile/VTINX Income]) include [[Treasury Inflation Protected Security|TIPS]] while none of the LifeStrategy funds includes [[Treasury Inflation Protected Security|TIPS]].

==Cost==
The target retirement funds and LifeStrategy funds have similar expense ratios.

==History==
LifeStrategy funds have longer history.  They were launched on 30 Sep 1994.  Target retirement funds were launched on 27 Oct 2003 or later.

Target date funds are useful for retirement saving, and also as age-adjusted portfolios for [[529|college savings plans]]. 

Target date funds are designed for people who want simple investment management. These funds make assumptions about their potential investors; one of which is [[Asset allocation|asset allocation]], an important investor decision. Although target date funds are designed for investors retiring in a given year (approximately), they are also useful for markedly different retirement dates or for other goals, depending on your particular objectives and risk tolerance. 

Target date funds have become increasingly popular over time. Many corporate retirement plans now offer these funds, often as default investment options. Target date fund total assets exceeded $4 trillion in 2024.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;[https://401kspecialistmag.com/tdfs-top-4-trillion-mark-in-2024-morningstar/#:~:text=Vanguard%20remains%20top%20TDF%20asset,billion%20and%20$16.8%20billion%2C%20respectively. 401kSpecialist - TDFs Top $4 Trillion Mark in 2024: Morningstar]&lt;/ref&gt; The top five target date fund companies account for approximately 80% of the market:&lt;ref&gt;[https://marketing.morningstar.com/content/cs-assets/v3/assets/blt9415ea4cc4157833/bltd2006cbdc6c250c8/683a0a55b705e0691463f1a4/Target-Date_Landscape_2025_(2).pdf Morningstar - 2025 Target-Date Fund Landscape]&lt;/ref&gt;

Different providers operate target date funds in different ways. The funds are often structured as funds-of-funds. Some providers only use index funds in their target date funds; others include a (large) portion of active funds. The fund expense ratios can differ widely between providers. However as of 2024 the average expense ratio has decreased to 0.29%, which represents an almost 50% decrease over 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;[https://marketing.morningstar.com/content/cs-assets/v3/assets/blt9415ea4cc4157833/bltd2006cbdc6c250c8/683a0a55b705e0691463f1a4/Target-Date_Landscape_2025_(2).pdf Morningstar - 2025 Target-Date Fund Landscape]&lt;/ref&gt; Passive funds account for 53% of TDF assets. As of 2024, [[Collective Investment Trusts|collective investment trusts]] have become the most common holder of target date funds, with 52% of total target date fund assets. [https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/investing-basics/glossary/collective-investment-trust-cit Collective investment trusts] are only available to qualified retirement plans and typically have lower expense ratios than mutual funds.

==Target date fund components==

Target date funds are typically comprised of stocks, bonds and cash. On the stocks side, typically there is a combination of a broad US equity fund and an ex-US / International fund. The allocation of each tends to vary between fund companies, but the allocation percents roughly approximate their respective global market weights, with US allocations ranging from 56%-70%.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.morningstar.com/funds/why-more-target-date-funds-are-underweighting-us-stocks-today Why More Target-Date Funds Are Underweighting US Stocks Today]&lt;/ref&gt;

On the bond side, typically you find a bond index fund including mix of US [[Treasury bond|Treasury bonds]] and [[corporate bonds]]. Also, some fund companies (such as Vanguard) include an allocation of [[international bonds]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://institutional.vanguard.com/investment/strategies/tdf-construction.html Vanguard-Target-date fund portfolio construction]&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, some fund companies also include [[Treasury Inflation Protected Securities]] (TIPS), with an increasing allocation of TIPS as the fund approaches the applicable target date. Cash allocations are typically low but grow as the target date is approached.

==Asset allocations - glide path==
Actual asset allocations of target date funds vary by fund company, but they typically approximate each other in rough terms. Funds with distant target retirement dates are almost all stocks, and funds with a target date retirement within the next few years will have a sizable portion of bonds. As the retirement date approaches the stock allocation decreases and the bond allocation increases, eventually ending up at a fixed lower equity percent some number of years after the target retirement date.  This pattern of sequentially decreasing equity allocations and ending up at terminal fixed equity allocation is commonly referred to as a [[glide path]].  Most target date funds offer retirement dates in five year increments.

Using Vanguard Target date funds as an example, in 2025, the Vanguard Target Retirement 2065 fund has a stock allocation of approximately 90% stocks and 10% bonds and cash.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[https://www.morningstar.com/funds/xnas/vlxvx/portfolio Morningstar - Vanguard Target Retirement 2065 Fund VLXVX]&lt;/ref&gt; The stock allocation of the fund series starts at 90% and decreases to 30% seven years after the target date year, while the bond/cash allocation increases correspondingly.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.morningstar.com/funds/vanguard-target-retirement-series Morningstar - Vanguard Target Retirement Series]&lt;/ref&gt; The following are the 2025 fund allocations:

Target Date Income Fund: 30% / 70%.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.morningstar.com/funds/xnas/vtinx/portfolio Morningstar - Vanguard Target Retirement Income Fund VTINX]&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the series the equity portion maintains a constant 60% US / 40% ex-US allocation. The bond portion maintains a 70% US / 30% ex-US allocation. Once the retirement date year is reached an allocation of short term TIPS is added to the bond allocation.

==Selecting an adequate target date fund==
The Department of Labor recommends that investors consider the following factors when selecting a target date fund:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.dol.gov/ebsa/pdf/TDFinvestorbulletin.pdf| title=Investor Bulletin: Target Date Retirement Funds| publisher=Department of Labor| date=May 6, 2010| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170216211307/https://www.dol.gov/sites/default/files/ebsa/about-ebsa/our-activities/resource-center/fact-sheets/TDFInvestorBulletin.pdf| archive-date=February 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

*Consider your investment style. Do you want to play an active role in managing your investments, or do you prefer the more hands-off approach of a target date fund? Keep in mind, however, that even with a target date fund, it is important to monitor the fund’s investments over time.
*Look at the fund’s prospectus to see where the fund will invest your money. Do you understand the strategy and risks of the fund, or of any underlying mutual funds held as investments?
*Understand how the investments will change over time. Are you comfortable with the fund’s investment mix over time? In particular, make sure you understand when the fund will reach its most conservative investment mix and whether that will occur at or after the target date. Does your level of risk tolerance match how aggressive or conservative it is?
*Take into account when you will access the money in the fund. How does the fund’s investment mix at the target date and thereafter fit with your plans for the future, whether they are to withdraw your money at retirement, or to continue to invest?
*Examine the fund’s fees. Do you understand the costs for both the target date fund and for any mutual funds in which the target date fund invests?

When choosing a fund, the [[Bogleheads]] recommendation is to ignore the fund's date. Instead, determine the amount of risk you are willing to tolerate, and then work backwards to find a fund that matches the chosen stock/bond allocation. You may be surprised to find a large discrepancy between your planned retirement date and the fund's target date. Remember that the fund does not know you, or your personal [[risk tolerance]].

==Target date fund advantages==
===Diversification===
With the purchase of a single fund, you gain exposure to a broad portfolio of US and international stocks, and thousands of US and international bonds. These funds are excellent choices if you do not have enough to meet the initial minimum investments for purchasing separate funds.

===Asset allocation on autopilot===
Professionals manage the [[asset allocation]], and it changes automatically as the target date gets closer.

Most investors tend to prefer a declining stock allocation glidepath as they approach and go through retirement in order to reduce risk at the point of withdrawing from their portfolios. Target date funds provide an automatic “set and forget” glidepath such that investors don’t have to worry about making continual de-risking adjustments to their portfolio as they approach and navigate retirement. 

Target date funds also provide ongoing rebalancing between asset classes, saving investors the time and effort needed to make such periodic adjustments.

===Simplicity===

For many, only having to manage one fund is easier than deciding on and managing a multiple fund portfolio. This is one reason target date funds are frequently found in employer retirement plans such as 401ks.

===Low expenses===

Most of the major brokerages now offer index fund versions of target date funds with expense ratios only slightly higher than that of comparable individual component index funds. As of 12/31/2024 the average Vanguard Target date expense ratio was 0.08%.&lt;ref&gt;[https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/mutual-funds/target-retirement-funds Vanguard Target Retirement Funds]&lt;/ref&gt; Fidelity Freedom Index Target date funds have ratios of approximately 0.12%.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fidelity.com/bin-public/060_www_fidelity_com/documents/SHDOCS/FDKLX/hosts/sh_comm_pmqa.002216.RETAIL_pdf.pdf Fidelity Freedom® Index Funds]&lt;/ref&gt; Some employer plans may have even lower expense offerings with “institutional” or [https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/investing-basics/glossary/collective-investment-trust-cit collective investment trust] versions.

==Criticisms==
Although target date funds provide very simple diversification for their shareholders, there are reasonable criticisms of them.

===Mismatch between target retirement year and asset allocation choice===
The funds set an asset allocation for a given target date either for education or retirement. Not everybody wants the same allocation, even if they will retire in the same year or target the same year for education expenses. You might find the fund's allocation for your target year is either too aggressive or too conservative. 

If you select a target date fund by its current asset allocation, and not the target year, you may find that the fund shifts its asset allocation either too soon or too late.

For example, suppose it is 2025 and you plan to retire in 2045 but you think the approximately 85% stocks 15% bond&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.morningstar.com/funds/xnas/vtivx/portfolio Morningstar - Vanguard Target Retirement 2045 Fund VTIVX]&lt;/ref&gt; allocation in Vanguard Target Retirement 2045 Fund is too aggressive for your need, ability and willingness to take risk. Instead, you like the allocation in Vanguard Target Retirement 2030 Fund, approximately 60% in stocks and 40% in bonds.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.morningstar.com/funds/xnas/vthrx/portfolio Morningstar - Vanguard Target Retirement 2030 Fund VTHRX]&lt;/ref&gt; If you invest in Target Retirement 2030, however, at some time close to 2030, the fund will shift its allocation more conservatively, while you are still at least 15 years away from your planned retirement.

On the other hand, if you would like to be more aggressive and invest in Target Retirement 2050 while you plan to retire in 2035, you may find the allocation in Target Retirement 2050 not shifting when you need a less aggressive allocation after you retire.

In addition to the bond allocation, some investors may prefer a different equity allocation between U.S. and ex-U.S. stocks. As of 2025, target date funds tend to approximate global market weights, with roughly 60% in U.S. and 40% ex-U.S. If you want to tilt one way or another a target date fund may not be the best choice.

===Tax inefficiency of target date retirement funds===
Target date retirement funds include all assets in one fund and some investors believe they do not allow for a [[tax-efficient fund placement]] of each individual asset class. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=287967 Additional aspects of tax efficiency and a one fund portfolio are discussed here.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The subject of tax efficient placement of assets is complex and often the optimal result depends on the specific assumptions involved, such as the applicable bond interest rate, the equity dividend and capital distribution rates, using risk adjust after tax returns, etc.  Refer to the tax efficient placement of assets page for a more thorough discussion.&lt;/ref&gt;

These funds all have an increasing and/or large allocation to bonds. Because bond fund distributions are considered ordinary income (that is, they are taxed at your [[marginal tax rate]]), you will pay higher taxes than a stock fund (taxed at a lower [[Capital gains distribution|capital gains rate]]).   

In addition, in many instances, such as with Vanguard, the equity distributions from the target date funds are not tax managed and are less tax efficient than comparable component index funds.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.morningstar.com/funds/another-capital-gains-season-forget-vanguards-target-date Morningstar-Another Capital Gains Season to Forget for Vanguard’s Target-Date]&lt;/ref&gt;  A [[fund of funds]] must pass on all capital gains distributed by the underlying funds, and cannot use the losses. It may also have to pay out its own gains when it rebalances, although many funds of funds can use new investments to rebalance and thus avoid distributing gains. Thus a fund of funds is more likely to distribute capital gains than a balanced fund with similar holdings. 

For the above reasons, in most circumstances, the most suitable location for target date funds is in tax-advantaged accounts such that tax efficiency becomes less relevant. 

If you expect to be in a low tax bracket for the intended holding period, these funds might be appropriate in a taxable account. Investors having both taxable and tax-advantaged accounts may be better served by splitting their equity and fixed income allocations, concentrating on tax-efficient asset location.

There are now ETF versions of Target Date Funds, such as [https://www.ishares.com/us/resources/tools/target-date-fund-finder#/home Blackrock ishares Lifepath series.].   These are relatively new and with any such offering there is always the possibility if they do not gather enough interest they can be subsequently closed, leading to unwanted potential capital gains recognition.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.morningstar.com/funds/new-era-retirement-savings Morningstar - A New Era for Retirement Savings]&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2010, the Regulated Investment Company Modernization Act of 2010 allows funds of funds to pass on the [[foreign tax credit]] from the individual funds to their shareholders.&lt;ref&gt;[[Fund of funds#Taxes]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=125475 Bogleheads - Foreign Tax Credit for Funds of Funds thread]&lt;/ref&gt;

Note: Taxes considerations are ''secondary'' to setting your desired [[asset allocation]].

===Possible unsatisfactory allocation choices===
Depending on your personal preferences, a target date fund's asset allocations could be unsatisfactory. For example:
* Some providers include active funds, and you may not want this.
* Providers sometimes change the allocation of their target date funds. If you do not like the new allocation, you might find it awkward to sell the fund, especially in a taxable account where you might face taxes.
* Certain asset classes may not be represented, for example, high-yield bonds and commodities. Funds often only add inflation-protected securities to their allocation as the target date nears.
* The funds' asset class weightings do not suit all tastes. 
** Target date funds have a fixed allocation to domestic and international. If you want to decide your domestic/international allocation yourself, you might not find this allocation satisfactory.
** The portfolios use market cap weighted funds, so they are inappropriate if you plan to [[Value Tilting - Stock | value "tilt"]] your stock allocation. 
** If you plan to hold equity REITs in proportion to the weighting of commercial property in the economy, funds weight REITs allocations only to the extent they appear in Total Stock Market Index.

===Expenses===
Historically, some mutual fund companies' target date fund [[expense ratios]] may have included an additional expense ratio, on top of the expense ratios of the underlying funds. Also there are currently versions of target dates funds that use underlying active funds with expense ratios higher than index funds. Finally some small company 401k plans may assess higher expense ratios on target date offerings.

As noted in the advantages section, in recent years index versions of target date funds have become more widely available with significantly lower expense ratios.

On February 6, 2013 Vanguard announced the creation of '''four fund portfolios''' by adding a strategic allocation of [[Developed market bonds|international hedged bonds]] to the firm's series of target date ([[Vanguard Target Retirement Funds|Target Retirement]]) and target risk ([[Vanguard LifeStrategy Funds|LifeStrategy]]) funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://pressroom.vanguard.com/content/press_release/2013.02.06_Vanguard_to_Further_Diversify_Target_Retirement_Funds.html| title=Vanguard to Further Diversify Target Retirement Funds| date=February 6, 2013| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190117081102/https://pressroom.vanguard.com/content/news/2013.02.06_Vanguard_to_Further_Diversify_Target_Retirement_Funds.html| archive-date=January 17, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; These funds are commonly offered by [[Employer Retirement Plans Overview|employer provided plans]], where they are often default investment options; in [[529 plans|529 college savings plans]]; and in [[IRA|individual retirement arrangements]].

The allocation plan adds the Vanguard International Bond Index fund to the portfolio asset mix. This bond fund is hedged to reduce currency risk.

==Three fund and four fund portfolios==

Prior to the addition of an international bond fund to the target date and target risk funds, the allocation of these balanced portfolios were versions of the very popular [[Three-Fund Portfolio|three fund portfolio]],&lt;ref&gt;{{forum link| t=88005| title=The Three Fund Portfolio}}&lt;/ref&gt; which consists of three broad asset class index funds:
* Total U.S. stock market index fund
* Total international stock index fund
* Total U.S. bond index fund

The four-fund portfolio that Vanguard is now using consists of the following broad asset class index funds:
* Total U.S. stock market index fund
* Total international stock index fund
* Total U.S. bond index fund
* Total international bond index fund

From 2013 - 2015 Vanguard allocated 30% of a portfolio's stock allocation to international stocks and allocated 20% of a portfolio's nominal bond allocation to international bonds.

Beginning in 2015, Vanguard increased the international allocations to the four fund portfolios. International stock allocations increased from 30% to 40% of a portfolio's stock allocation. International bonds increased from 20% to 30% of a portfolio's nominal bond allocation. The allocation changes began in the second quarter of 2015 and were completed before year-end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://institutional.vanguard.com/VGApp/iip/site/institutional/researchcommentary/article/NewsInstinfo022615QA| title=2015 changes to Target Retirement Funds, Q&amp;A| publisher=Vanguard Institutional| date=February 26, 2015| accessdate=28 February 2015}}{{dead link}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://institutional.vanguard.com/VGApp/iip/site/institutional/researchcommentary/article/NewsInstinfo022615| title=Expanded target-date lineup, more diversification| publisher=Vanguard| date=February 26, 2015| accessdate=August 9, 2015}}{{dead link}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|Vanguard funds: life strategy funds vs target retirement funds}}

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' are lifecycle offerings, providing investors with a variety of highly diversified all-in-one portfolios. The products are structured as [[Fund of funds | funds-of-funds]], charging only [[Acquired fund fees and expenses|weighted averages]] of the [[Expense ratios | expense ratios]] associated with the underlying [[Indexing|index]] funds.&lt;ref&gt;[https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/vanguard/LifeStrategyList Lifestrategy Funds], Vanguard official site&lt;/ref&gt; 

LifeStrategy funds are cheap by any reasonable standard. In contrast to the Vanguard series of similar one fund diversified portfolios, [[ Vanguard Target Retirement Funds |target retirement funds]], which use a gradual shifting strategic asset allocation over time, the LifeStrategy funds have a fixed target asset allocation.

Vanguard considers the LifeStrategy funds to be'' target risk funds'', in contrast to ''target date'' target retirement funds. 

==Four portfolios==
While the funds are ostensibly designed for investors having a certain level of risk tolerance (approximately), and are typically considered to be retirement accumulation or retirement decumulation vehicles, you can use them for other goals, depending on your objectives. For example, the LifeStrategy funds are often investment options in many state run [[529 plans]] designed for funding college education expenses.

There are four LifeStrategy funds:

==Fund allocations==

On February 26, 2015, Vanguard announced an increase in the funds' international equity allocation from 30% to 40% of equity exposure, and an increase in the international fixed income allocation from 20% to 30% of nominal fixed income exposure.&lt;ref&gt;[https://personal.vanguard.com/us/insights/article/fund-announcement-02262015 Vanguard enhances diversification for target date funds and other all-in-one funds] 26 Feb 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The tables below show allocations of the funds after the 2015 reset. The reallocation of fund assets was completed by the end of 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[https://institutional.vanguard.com/VGApp/iip/site/institutional/researchcommentary/article/NewsInstinfo022615QA 2015 changes to Target Retirement Funds, Q&amp;A], Vanguard Institutional, February 26, 2015.

==Drawbacks==
While LifeStrategy Funds provide very simple diversification for their shareholders, there are some reasonable criticisms.

===Tax inefficiency===
Because the LifeStrategy Funds all have a significant allocation to taxable bonds, they are most suitable for investors holding their entire portfolios in tax-advantaged accounts. If you have both taxable and tax-advantaged accounts you are generally better served by splitting your equity and fixed income allocations, concentrating on tax-efficient asset location. Among the tax considerations are:
 
* When held in a tax-advantaged account, stocks lose any special benefits they have in a taxable account.&lt;ref group="note"&gt; Potential advantages for holding stocks in a taxable account include:

* Tax-deferred accounts convert long-term capital gains into ordinary income upon distribution; tax rates on long-term capital gains have been, at most times, lower than ordinary income rates.
* Qualified dividends are currently taxed at a lower rate.
* Long-term capital gains are only due when realized, giving another way to defer taxes.
* Ability to harvest losses.
* Ability to donate appreciated shares to charity, avoiding all taxes.
* Estate planning; there is a potential for stepped-up cost basis upon death.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* In a taxable account the bond dividends will get taxed annually at ordinary income rates; when held in tax advantaged accounts this tax can be deferred.
* By holding a balanced fund in a taxable account the investor loses the option to [[Tax loss harvesting | harvest losses]] of individual asset classes.
* The fund has a history of changing asset allocation and targeted asset classes. If the change is not appropriate for you, selling your holding could create an unwanted large capital gains tax liability.

===Allocation choices===
Depending on your personal preferences, the LifeStrategy Funds' asset allocations could be unsatisfactory. For example:
* Certain asset classes are not represented. For example, inflation-protected securities and commodities are entirely absent.
* The funds' asset class weightings do not suit all tastes. If you aim to match global asset allocations, 60% of equities are domestic, which is above the U.S. share by world market capitalization. The portfolios employ asset class funds that are market cap weighted, so the funds are not appropriate if you want to [[Value Tilting - Stock | value "tilt"]] the equity allocation of your U.S. stock holdings. If you want to hold equity REITs in proportion to the weighting of commercial property in the economy, the funds' REITs allocations are represented only to the extent they appear in Total Stock Market Index.

==History==
Vanguard launched all four LifeStrategy Funds on September 30, 1994. Since then the fund has made numerous changes in asset class selections and portfolio allocations.

===Changes in 2011===
Vanguard announced a change in the funds' investment policy on September 30, 2011.&lt;ref group="note"&gt; From 1994-2011 the LifeStrategy funds asset allocations were implemented with these Vanguard fund portfolios:
*Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund
*Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund
*Vanguard Asset Allocation Fund
*Vanguard Total Bond Market II Index Fund
*Vanguard Short-Term Investment Grade Bond Fund&lt;/ref&gt; The funds adopted an all-index fund portfolio and implemented the change across several months following September 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[https://personal.vanguard.com/us/insights/article/fund-announcementB-09302011 LifeStrategy Funds to adopt all-index approach], September 30, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the investment world, the term '''glide path''' refers to the process by which a target date fund changes its [[Asset allocation|asset allocation]] among risky assets (which can include [[Stock basics | stocks]], [[Domestic/International | international stocks]], [[Real estate investment trust |REITs]] and [[Commodities | commodities]]) and lower risk assets such as  [[Bond basics | bonds]], [[Treasury Inflation Protected Securities | inflation indexed bonds]] and [[Money markets | money market funds]] over a time horizon. Target date funds include [[Target Retirement Funds | target retirement funds]] in the retirement plan market, as well as [[529 plans#529 Plan Investment Programs | age-adjusted portfolios]] in the college savings plan market. The glide path of a target fund shifts from high risky equity allocations at inception to ever higher fixed income investments as the target date approaches.

==Target retirement funds glide paths==

Target retirement funds almost universally begin with high equity allocations for young investors. However each fund group establishes a glide path for its series of target funds, and these glide paths vary considerably. In general, however, a fund's glide path will follow one of three methods: straight line, stepped, or rolldown.

:1. '''Straight Line''':  A straight line glide path takes a steady, linear approach that gradually reduces the equity weighting of the portfolio over time. [[The Vanguard Group |Vanguard]] and [[TIAA-CREF]] take this approach.&lt;ref&gt;Vanguard outlines their approach and reasoning to glide paths [https://personal.vanguard.com/pdf/icrtdf.pdf Vanguard’s approach to target-date funds] &lt;/ref&gt;

|}   &lt;!-- end of table --&gt;


:2. '''Stepped''':  With a stepped glide path the equity allocation is held steady until periodically adjusted. ING takes this approach. In their stepped glide path, during the first three decades the adjustment is made every ten years; subsequent adjustments are made in five year intervals.

|}   &lt;!-- end of table --&gt;


:3. '''Rolldown''': This glide path method holds high levels of equity allocations until approximately twenty years before the retirement date, when a sharp reduction in the equity allocation begins, extending through the decumulation stage. [[Fidelity]] takes this approach.&lt;ref&gt; [http://corporate.morningstar.com/US/documents/MethodologyDocuments/ResearchPapers/TargetDateFundSeries_IndustrySurvey.pdf Target-Date Series Research Paper: 2009 Industry Survey,] p.10&lt;/ref&gt;

Target retirement fund managers justify high equity allocations for young investors on the grounds that a long time horizon allows the investor plenty of time to recover from the down cycles of markets and  that the large amount of human capital (future lifetime earnings)  the young investor possesses provides the investor ample opportunities for increasing the personal savings rate when the markets decline. In the meantime the investor can garner a greater percentage of the expected equity return premium over an investment career by holding the higher equity allocation. While a target date's glide path will slowly reduce the equity allocation over the lifetime of the investor, target date funds ordinarily hold a considerable allocation to equity investments as an investor approaches retirement age. These allocations are attributable to the fact that most target retirement funds are designed to be held through the planned retirement date and held over the entire period of the investor's retirement phase. Firms with high post retirement  equity allocations base their asset allocation decision on the expected increased longevity of post retirement accounts. The lengthened time horizon allows time for recovery from market down cycles during the early stage of retirement, and, assuming a realization of an expected equity return premium, the portfolio will have a higher value to help mitigate the risk of having reduced income at the end of a long life.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www2.troweprice.com/rms/rps/Sponsors/DefaultContent/StaticAssets/Revisiting_TRP_Asset_Alloc_GP_Strategy.pdf Revisiting T. Rowe Price’s Asset Allocation Glide-Path Strategy]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The dispersion of equity allocations in the universe of target retirement funds is a narrow 2.5% in the 2055 series of target date funds. This dispersion of equity allocations widens to 40%-50% as the target series approaches the retirement years. For example, the range of equity allocation in 2010 target date funds falls between a low 26% allocation in the Wells Fargo Advantage 2010 fund and a high 72% allocation in the Alliance Bernstein 2010 fund. Figure 4. illustrates the diversity of glide path allocations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://corporate.morningstar.com/US/documents/MethodologyDocuments/ResearchPapers/TargetDateFundSeries_IndustrySurvey.pdf Target-Date Series Research Paper: 2009 Industry Survey,] pp.7-8&lt;/ref&gt;

The divergence in asset allocation resulted in a wide dispersion of returns in the 2008 market collapse. Losses in the 2010 target fund series ranged from -9% to -41%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://advisor.morningstar.com/articles/article.asp?s=0&amp;docId=17632&amp;pgNo=1 Five Concerns About Target-Date Funds], John Rackenthaler, Morningstar Advisor, 10-31-2009 &lt;/ref&gt; Clearly, two funds bearing the same target date can have markedly different portfolio allocations, risk exposures, and returns. These performance disparities have drawn the attention of the SEC&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.sec.gov/news/press/2009/2009-138.htm SEC, DOL Announce Panelists, Agenda for Joint Hearing on Target Date Funds]&lt;/ref&gt; and the Congress.&lt;ref&gt; [http://aging.senate.gov/hearing_detail.cfm?id=319426&amp; Default Nation: Are 401(k) Target Date Funds Missing The Mark?]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Target retirement fund indexes==
[[File:Morningstarglidepaths.png|thumb|right|451px]]
Index providers Dow Jones, Standard &amp; Poor's, and Morningstar have developed indexes for benchmarking target retirement fund portfolios.  Dow Jones and Morningstar employ risk based metrics in devising the index glide path.  S&amp;P attempts to mirror the glide paths used by the actual target funds comprising the market.The Index glide path methodologies are outlined below:

:*'''Dow Jones Target Date Indexes ''': Glide path follows a monthly equity risk exposure reduction formula, from 90% to 20% of the total equity risk.&lt;ref name="Methodologies"&gt;[http://corporate.morningstar.com/us/documents/Indexes/TargetDateIndexComparison.pdf Target Date Index Comparison Grid]&lt;/ref&gt;
:*'''S&amp;P Target Date Indexes''': Glide path is a scrubbed average of nearly all active Target Date fund equity allocations – consensus glide path is the objective.&lt;ref name="Methodologies"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
:*'''Morningstar Target Date Indexes''': Modern Portfolio Theory-based asset allocation, optimized to human capital asset assumptions. Liability-driven investment (LDI) approach using investor balance sheet construct for surplus optimization. Indexes are provided for three risk profiles: conservative, moderate, and aggressive.&lt;ref name="Methodologies"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

The following table provides the Index equity targets for selective ages: a youthful starting date; a date ten years prior to a common retirement date; a common retirement age; and a date five years after retirement. The glide paths of the seven largest mutual fund managers is also provided in the table. The benchmark indexes can help investors gauge the relative riskiness of a given target retirement fund's guide path strategy.

==College savings plans glide paths==
The time horizon for a child's college savings is bounded by the assumed ages of college enrollment (18-22). The glide paths of 529 Savings Plan age-adjusted portfolios are therefore usually much more conservative than those used in the retirement plan market. Many plans transition portfolios to hold 100% cash or 100% cash/fixed income portfolios at age 18+. However, as in the retirement plan market, there is a wide variance in the range of stock allocations for the 18-22 age period. Many 529 savings plans offer risk-based portfolios (Conservative, Moderate, and Aggressive) and the equity allocations for the 18+ age group in many aggressive portfolios range from 10% equity to 65% equity.&lt;ref name="study"&gt;[http://www.savingforcollege.com/articles/savingforcollegecoms-age-based-allocation-study-nov-2008 Savingforcollege.com’s age-based allocation study (Nov 2008)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The following table shows the glide path allocations for the three largest 529 Plan vendors in the direct market 529 plan universe, Vanguard, TIAA-CREF, and Fidelity. The allocations are provided for equity investments, fixed income investments, and money market fund investments.

{{Notice | The Vanguard table entries will be outdated as of October 30, 2020 -- Vanguard has announced  [https://www.vanguard.com/pdf/529rogp.pdf plans to transition to a target-enrollment approach].}}

Many Vanguard 529 plans follow the glide path illustrated in the table. However some states (Illinois and Indiana) hold a 10% equity allocation in the 18+ age band. Iowa, Missouri, Nebraska, and North Carolina supply a 20% equity allocation in the aggressive allocation portfolios. Utah's option 3, the most aggressive allocation in that state's plan, holds a 65% equity allocation at age 18.&lt;ref name="study"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Individual retirement portfolios and glide paths==

As mentioned  in [[Withdrawal methods#Constant-dollar (age in bonds)|bond percentage equal to your age]], many people prefer not to keep a static stock/bond allocation throughout their retirement, but to gradually have their portfolio become more conservative by reducing the stock allocation and increasing the bond allocation as they age. However, the rule-of-thumb method where your bond percentage is equal to your age is sometimes seen as a bit too conservative. Another method, similar to the allocations used by some retirement-date funds is to follow a ''glide-path'' allocation change that isn't necessarily directly linear, as is the bonds=age method. Often, a glide-path method will add bonds to the portfolio mix more slowly in the early years before retirement, thus allowing the portfolio more possibility for growth before retirement. Then, after retirement, the glide-path may transition more quickly to a bond-heavy allocation, thus shielding the portfolio from stock market volatility during later retirement years.
Figure 4 shows a graph comparing the ''(100-age)'' stock allocation and the ''Log(100-age)-1'' glide-path allocation. The blue (100-age) line is linear, changing the allocation by 1% each year. The glide-path allocation changes more slowly in the earlier years, presumably allowing for more portfolio growth during the accumulation years, and then turns quicker towards a more conservative allocation during the retirement years, eventually becoming more conservative and following a 100% bond allocation for age 90 and later.

|}   &lt;!-- end of table --&gt;

As with the similar [[Withdrawal methods##Constant-dollar (age in bonds)|''bond percentage equal to your age'']] method, following a glide-path stock/bond allocation allows the overall portfolio to become more conservative each year. The results, shown in Figure 6, are similar to the ''bonds equal age ''method, but in the time-period shown in the graph, the slower transition to bonds allowed the overall portfolio to grow a bit more, resulting in slightly more money being withdrawn from the portfolio, while retaining a similar volatility.

The fund, along with the series of [[Vanguard target retirement funds]], has a $1,000 minimum investment, lower than the typical $3,000 minimum investment threshold for most Vanguard funds. The fund is sometimes suggested in the Bogleheads forum as a suitable mutual fund for investors who are just getting started and cannot meet a $3,000 minimum.

==Basic features==

The STAR fund is a [[Fund of funds |fund-of-funds]]. The STAR fund invests in a selection of Vanguard mutual funds, all of which are actively managed. It has an [[Acquired fund fees and expenses|acquired fund fee and expenses]] (AFFE) expense ratio of 0.3%, typical of Vanguard's expense ratios for its active funds and low by general industry standards, but high compared to index funds. As with other funds-of-funds, no lower cost admiral shares are offered nor is it available as an [[ETF]].

As a 60/40 balanced fund, the fund might be compared to Vanguard Balanced Index Fund, Vanguard Wellington Fund, [[Vanguard LifeStrategy funds | Vanguard LifeStrategy]] Moderate Growth Fund, and whichever [[Vanguard target retirement funds | Vanguard target retirement fund]] has close to a similar allocation.

==Historical notes==
The fund was created in 1985. In 1987 the New York Times noted:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/10/business/investing-too-many-choices-one-fund-buys-all.html| title=Too Many Choices? One Fund Buys All| date=May 10, 1987| publisher=New York Times| accessdate=August 27, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
{{blockquote|In the past two years, a number of firms have revived the fund-of-funds approach of the 1960s, in which a money manager invests in a variety of mutual funds, rather than directly in stocks or bonds... The Vanguard Group was one of the first organizations to revive the fund-of-funds concept when it offered its STAR Fund, which invests in shares of Vanguard's other mutual funds.}}

According to posters in the Bogleheads forum, STAR is an acronym for "Special Tax-Advantaged Retirement," although it was never limited to retirement accounts; it is one of a group of seven Vanguard funds each of which is formally a "portfolio" within a single "trust," an arcane fact of no practical importance.&lt;ref group="note"&gt; From the annual SEC required [http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/736054/000093247110003821/0000932471-10-003821.txt NSAR filing]:

The '''{{PAGENAME}}'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/mutual-funds/target-retirement-funds| title=Vanguard Target Retirement Funds | publisher=Vanguard| accessdate=September 10, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; are [[target date funds]] designed for retirement. They are lifecycle funds that provide a selection of highly diversified all-in-one portfolios.

These funds are structured as [[fund of funds|funds-of-funds]], and charge only weighted averages of the [[Expense ratios | expense ratios]] of the funds they hold, which are primarily indexed. [https://corporate.vanguard.com/content/corporatesite/us/en/corp/who-we-are/pressroom/vanguard-returns-value-to-shareholders-with-lower-costs-for-target-retirement-funds.html In 2022 Vanguard lowered target date fund expense ratios across the board.]  Although Vanguard designed these funds primarily for someone retiring in a given year (approximately), you can use them for other goals or for significantly different retirement dates, depending on your objectives and [[Risk and return: an introduction|risk tolerance]]. The funds have a low $1,000 minimum investment for opening a fund account.

Except for the [{{vf|0308}} Vanguard Target Retirement Income Fund], each fund has a date specified in its name. The funds become more conservative over time, [[Glide paths |shifting their asset allocations]] from equities toward fixed income. The funds' prospectus&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?action=getcompany&amp;CIK=S000002570&amp;type=485&amp;dateb=&amp;count=40&amp;scd=filingst| title=EDGAR Search Results| publisher=SEC| accessdate=September 10, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; indicates that within seven years of the stated date, a given fund's asset allocation will come to resemble that of [{{vf|0308}} Target Retirement Income Fund], which has a static allocation and is designed primarily for retirees.

As of 2023, Vanguard target retirement funds hold a total of about $1.3 trillion in assets&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.plansponsor.com/target-date-assets-reach-record-high-3-5-trillion-in-2023/ Target-Date Assets Reach Record High $3.5 Trillion in 2023]&lt;/ref&gt;, the largest competitor in the market.  

[[Vanguard LifeStrategy funds]] are similar to Target Retirement Funds, but do not have a glide path. You can use both [[Vanguard LifeStrategy Funds|LifeStrategy funds]] and target retirement funds as an all-in-one portfolio.

== Comparison with generic target date funds ==
{{main|Target date funds}}
Vanguard Target date funds are target retirement funds primarily built from index funds and charge expense ratios comparable to the weighted averages of the expense ratios associated with the underlying funds. These are desirable fund characteristics.

As with other target date funds, Vanguard target retirement funds give you diversification and asset allocation on autopilot. Also the criticism are similar: possible mismatch between target retirement year and asset allocation choice, tax inefficiency, and possible unsatisfactory allocation choices. 

On the positive side, Vanguard lowered target date funds expense ratios across the board and now has among the lowest in the industry.&lt;ref&gt;[https://corporate.vanguard.com/content/corporatesite/us/en/corp/who-we-are/pressroom/vanguard-returns-value-to-shareholders-with-lower-costs-for-target-retirement-funds.html Vanguard Returns Value to Shareholders with Lower Costs for Target Retirement Funds]&lt;/ref&gt;  On the negative side, Vanguard target date funds have gained attention for their tax inefficiency compared to other target date funds as well as compared to other Vanguard index fund offerings.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2025/01/23/vanguards-106-million-tdf-settlement-offers-a-key-lesson-about-taxes.html Vanguard's $106 million target-date fund settlement offers a key lesson about taxes]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.morningstar.com/funds/another-capital-gains-season-forget-vanguards-target-date Another Capital Gains Season to Forget for Vanguard’s Target-Date]&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Choosing a Vanguard target retirement fund==

'''Note''': ''Vanguard's [https://personal.vanguard.com/us/planningeducation/general/PEdGPCreateCompInvQuestContent.jsp Investor Questionnaire] is designed to assist investors with choosing an [[Asset allocation|asset allocation]]. (Select: "Begin the Vanguard Investor Questionnaire")''

Target retirement funds are designed for investors who to manage their investments simply. These funds make assumptions about their potential investors; one of which is [[Asset allocation|asset allocation]], the single most important decision an investor has to make. They cannot know the investors [[Risk and return: an introduction|risk]] profile.

When choosing a fund, the Bogleheads recommendation is to ignore the fund's date. Instead, determine the amount of risk you are willing to tolerate and work backwards to find a fund that matches the chosen stock/bond allocation. You may be surprised to find a large discrepancy between the planned retirement date and the fund's target date. Remember that the fund does not know anything about you.

There are some disadvantages to this method ([[#Mismatch between target retirement year and asset allocation choice |see below]]), but if you are starting out then do not be put off. You can always [[Rebalancing|rebalance]] later, especially if you hold the fund in a tax-advantaged account.

==Summary asset allocation==

As of February 8, 2021, Target Retirement Fund asset allocations range from 90/10 (stock/bonds) to 30/70 (stocks/bonds).

==History==

Vanguard launched its first six Target Retirement Funds on 27 October, 2003: Target Retirement 2045, 2035, 2025, 2015, 2005, and Income. It opened five additional funds 7 June, 2006: Target Retirement 2050, 2040, 2030, 2020, and 2010. The Target Retirement 2055 fund was opened on 10 August, 2010, and the Target Retirement 2060 fund was opened on 19 January, 2012. The funds' fiscal year ends on September 30 of each year.

In the years since launching the Target Retirement funds, Vanguard has made two significant changes to the funds' asset allocation: gradually increasing and broadening the international exposure in both equities and bonds; and, in 2006, increasing the funds' asset allocation to equities.

===2006 target retirement changes===

In March 2006 Vanguard changed the asset allocations of its existing Target Retirement Funds, increasing their aggressiveness with a larger equity allocation of roughly 10 to 20 percentage points, depending on the fund.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://us.vocuspr.com/newsroom/Query.aspx?SiteName=vanguardnew&amp;Entity=PRAsset&amp;SF_PRAsset_PRAssetID_EQ=146273&amp;XSL=PressRelease&amp;PublishType=Press+Release&amp;Cache=True| title=Vanguard press release| publisher=Vanguard| date=2006}}{{dead link}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original Target Retirement Fund allocations are provided in the Funds' [http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/752177/000093247103000686/targetretirementprospedgar.txt preliminary prospectus], dated 5 August, 2003.

===2010 target retirement fund changes===

On September 27, 2010, Vanguard announced that it would replace the three underlying international portfolios with a single broad international stock index fund. Vanguard also increased the overall international equity exposure of these funds from approximately 20% to approximately 30% of the equity allocations.

Under the simplified approach, ''most'' of the Target Retirement Funds were comprised of [[:Three-fund portfolio | three broad index funds]]. Target Retirement Funds with target dates greater than five years from the current year offered allocations constructed using only three funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{forum link| t=60713| title=Vanguard:Changes In Target Retirement Funds| date=September 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="VG1"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://institutional.vanguard.com/VGApp/iip/site/institutional/researchcommentary/article?File=NewsTIEqExp| title=Vanguard adjusts international equity exposure in Target Retirement Funds and other balanced funds| publisher=Vanguard}}{{dead link}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://institutional.vanguard.com/VGApp/iip/site/institutional/researchcommentary/article?File=InvComDiversifiesTRF| title=Vanguard streamlines construction and improves diversification of Target Retirement Funds| publisher=Vanguard| date=October 5, 2010| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101020021216/https://institutional.vanguard.com/VGApp/iip/site/institutional/researchcommentary/article?File=InvComDiversifiesTRF| archive-date=October 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the funds transitioned into the Target Income portfolio, the funds added an inflation-indexed bond fund and a money market fund to the strategic asset allocation.

===2013 target retirement fund changes===

In June 2013 Vanguard added the Vanguard Total International Bond Index Fund to the Vanguard target retirement funds. The new [[Developed market bonds|international bond]] fund represented 20% of the fixed income allocation for each of the funds.

Vanguard also replaced the Vanguard Inflation-Protected Securities Fund with Vanguard Short-Term Inflation-Protected Securities Index Fund in Vanguard Target Retirement Income Fund, Vanguard Target Retirement 2010 Fund, and Vanguard Target Retirement 2015 Fund.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://personal.vanguard.com/us/insights/article/fund-announcement-05312013-international| title=International bond index fund and ETF now available| publisher=Vanguard| date=June 14, 2013}}{{dead link}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text bytes="7057" sha1="4wa3ntou1ooanrc2g5xsa7l4n04c8rm" xml:space="preserve">The '''[[Thrift Savings Plan]]''' offers participants five '''Lifecycle''' funds containing a mix of the TSP's five core funds. The Lifecycle funds are [[Target date retirement funds]], with the same expenses as the other TSP funds.

== Composition ==
=== Glide path ===
The charts and data below, one separate tabs of the embedded spreadsheet, show the [[Glide paths|glide path]] of the Lifecycle funds, using data as of January 18, 2018.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;[https://www.tsp.gov/investmentfunds/lfundsheet/fundPerformance_L.shtml Lifecycle Fund Performance] at https://www.tsp.gov as of 18 January 2018. Readers are encouraged to visit the TSP site for up-to-date compositions of the Lifecycle Funds.&lt;/ref&gt;

General themes of the Lifecycle funds glide path:

* The glide paths shift toward bond funds over the years, as expected.
* Within the bonds allocations, the allocation shifts more toward G Fund and away from the F Fund as retirement age is reached.
* Within the US equity allocation, there is a slight shift from the S Fund (small cap) toward the C Fund (large cap) as retirement age is reached.
* The US to International equity ratio stays at 70:30 through the entire glide path.

The various tabs (click each tab's hyperlink to view) depict:

* '''TSP Lifecycle Glide Path''' - Illustrates how each decade, the holdings in the three equity funds gradually decline, while the G Fund steadily climbs until the G Fund becomes 74% of the holdings when the Income phase is reached. The sky blue line labeled '''Equity''' shows the overall equity percentage of each fund (C Fund + S Fund + I Fund).
* '''Glide Path''' - displays the equity percentage (C Fund + S Fund + I Fund) of each Lifecycle fund, starting in year 2018 (representing the L 2050 fund) through the 40 years ending with the L Income fund. Note that the data points are in ten-year intervals, so the actual glide path is a gentler slope. For comparison, [[Vanguard target retirement funds | Vanguard Target Retirement Date funds]] and Fidelity Freedom Funds of the same year are shown. 
* '''Fixed Income Glide Path''' - Many TSP investors question how much G Fund to hold relative to the F Fund and other fixed income assets. This decision can be informed by the prescribed holdings of the G Fund and F Fund in the Lifecycle funds, relative to the investor's point in time in their investment lifetime. The chart on this tab shows how in the Lifecycle fund, the F Fund starts at 6 percent for the youngest investor, and stays at almost that same percentage all the way through retirement age. By comparison, the G Fund starts out with an allocation nearly double the F Fund and then climbs steadily over the decades, increasingly so over the five years before the "Income" year is reached.
* '''Fixed Income as Percentage''' - shows the relative holdings of the G Fund and F Fund and compares their relative weights as the two components of the fixed income portion of the portfolio, across the decades of the Lifecycle funds. The F Fund proportion starts out as roughly one-third of the overall fixed income allocation, and steadily decreases over the years.
* '''US Stocks as Percentage''' - shows the relative holdings of the C Fund and S Fund and compares their relative weights across the decades of the Lifecycle funds. There is a slight shift toward C Fund (large-cap) and away from S Fund (small-cap) as the glide path goes from the younger investor toward retirement income phase.
* '''US vs International''' - shows that the US equity (C Fund + S Fund) to International equity (I Fund) ratio stays constant at 70:30 for all Lifecycle funds.

Note that these curves were auto-created by Google Spreadsheets. A more careful look at the glide path reveals that the rise in G Fund, and the attendant decline in the other four funds, occurs more dramatically in the final five years before the the Income level arrives, than is depicted in the smoother blue line in the chart. Also, be aware that the data points in these spreadsheet are separated by ten years; the lines between the data points in this graph are "straighter" than they truly are in real life. In real life the lines will be smoother.

== Role in portfolio ==
TSP investors considering a Lifecycle fund should consider the same questions that investors in any target date retirement fund must weigh. See [[Target date retirement funds]] for a review of these general considerations.

Issues of concern to TSP investors in particular include:
* The fact that the [[I Fund]] is not a complete international fund may lead some investors to not use the Lifecycle fund in favor of using individual funds and holding the international allocation outside the TSP. This concern will become moot in 2018 or 2019 because on December 6, 2017, the TSP's governing board "at its most recent meeting accepted a recommendation by a consultant to switch to linking the I Fund to the [[MSCI]] All Country World Index, which covers non-U.S. developed markets, smaller companies and emerging markets."&lt;ref name="fedw_TSPt"&gt;{{Cite web | title = TSP to Change I Fund Index, Leave Others as Is | publisher = FEDweek | date = 2017-12-06 | accessdate = 2017-12-08 | url = http://www.fedweek.com/fedweek/tsp-change-fund-index-leave-others/ | quote = The board at its most recent meeting accepted a recommendation by a consultant to switch to linking the I Fund to the MSCI All Country World Index, which covers non-U.S. developed markets, smaller companies and emerging markets.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Forum link|t=233929|title=Thrift Savings Plan to Change I Fund Index|date=December 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The change could take a year or more to implement.
* The TSP Lifecycle funds employ an active investing approach for setting the funds' glide paths, which is based on efficient frontier analysis using capital market assumptions over a 20-year time horizon and stochastic modeling projections for inflation, economic growth, salary growth, corporate profits, P/E rations, interest rates, and exchange rates.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;See: {{cite web| url=https://www.frtib.gov/pdf/minutes/MM-2016Nov-Att6.pdf| title=Thrift Savings Plan Lifecycle Fund Asset Allocation| publisher=Mercer| date=November 2016}}{{dead link}}&lt;/ref&gt; Investors looking for a passive approach may want to use individual funds and look to Vanguard, Fidelity, or another large fund family for examples of target date glide paths.

An '''exchange-traded fund''', or '''ETF''', is a registered investment company. An ETF is a fund that holds a collection of assets and is traded on the market, and investors buy or sell from another shareholder on the stock exchange. ETFs have a creation and redemption procedure that generally makes the difference between price and [[Net asset value |NAV]] very small. 

Besides ETFs, other forms of the registered investment company include [[Mutual fund | mutual funds]], [[Closed End Funds | closed-end funds]], and [[Unit investment trusts | unit investment trusts]]. Legally, an ETF is classified as an open end company or unit investment trust,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/investing-basics/glossary/exchange-traded-fund-etf| title=Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF)| publisher=Investor.gov| accessdate=August 13, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in the U.S. a number of other exchange traded products which are not regulated investment companies are often grouped under the exchange traded fund banner. These products include exchange traded grantor trusts, exchange traded notes (ETNs), and certain exchange traded partnerships ([[Master limited partnership|MLPs]]).&lt;ref name="ETFGUide"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.etfguide.com:80/exchangetradedfunds.htm| title=ETF Guide: ETF History| publisher=etfguide| date=2013| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130308040157/http://www.etfguide.com:80/exchangetradedfunds.htm| archive-date=March 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ETFs are like mutual funds in that they hold a collection of assets, usually [[Stock basics|stocks]], [[Bond basics|bonds]] or other securities. Like closed-ended funds, ETFs trade on the market at a premium or discount from their [[net asset value]] (NAV). However, unlike closed-end funds, which often trade at large discounts or premiums to NAV, a special procedure for creating or redeeming shares allows institutional investors to perform arbitrage by swapping blocks of securities for ETF shares. This creation/redemption procedure, implemented by [[authorized participants]], generally makes the difference between price and NAV very small. 

At year end 2015, ETFs in the U.S. totaled 1,597 funds holding 2.1 trillion dollars in net assets.{{#tag:ref|'''Number of ETFs and total net assets (billions of dollars)'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.ici.org/publications| title=Investment Company Institute Factbooks| publisher=ICI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
{{Quote
|quote = &lt;u&gt;SEC: Distinguishing Features of ETFs&lt;/u&gt;
*ETFs do not sell individual shares directly to investors and only issue their shares in large blocks (blocks of 50,000 shares, for example) that are known as "Creation Units."
*Investors generally do not purchase Creation Units with cash. Instead, they buy Creation Units with a basket of securities that generally mirrors the ETF’s portfolio. Those who purchase Creation Units are frequently institutions.
*After purchasing a Creation Unit, an investor often splits it up and sells the individual shares on a secondary market. This permits other investors to purchase individual shares (instead of Creation Units).
*Investors who want to sell their ETF shares have two options: (1) they can sell individual shares to other investors on the secondary market, or (2) they can sell the Creation Units back to the ETF. In addition, ETFs generally redeem Creation Units by giving investors the securities that comprise the portfolio instead of cash. So, for example, an ETF invested in the stocks contained in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) would give a redeeming shareholder the actual securities that constitute the DJIA instead of cash. Because of the limited redeemability of ETF shares, ETFs are not considered to be—and may not call themselves—mutual funds.

ETFs investing in stocks and bonds are usually structured as open-end funds or unit investment trusts. Commodities and currencies are usually structured as either grantor trusts, Exchange Traded Notes (ETNs) or as Master Limited Partnerships (MLPs). The following chart allows you to more easily visualize the four major ETF product structures. 

[[File:ETPs.jpg|center|thumb|400px|Image courtesy of [[Rick Ferri]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.rickferri.com/blog/investments/etfs-explained-part-1-products/| title=ETFs Explained (Part 1 – Products)| author=Rick Ferri| author-link=Rick Ferri| date=May 9, 2011| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923024546/http://www.rickferri.com/blog/investments/etfs-explained-part-1-products/| archive-date=September 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

===Open end fund=== 
The most flexible and most common form of ETF structure is the open end fund, which is registered under the [[wikipedia:Investment Company Act of 1940|Investment Company Act of 1940]]. This structure has the following characteristics:
# The fund has a board of directors.
# The fund can replicate or sample an index.
# The fund can invest in derivatives.
# The fund can engage in security lending. Some ETF providers (including Vanguard) allocate all security lending income to the ETF; other ETF providers (among them iShares) divide security lending income between the ETF and the management company.
# Dividends are immediately reinvested and paid to shareholders (monthly or quarterly).
# Tax reporting is done with an IRS 1099 document.&lt;ref name="ETFGUide" /&gt;

===Unit investment trust=== 
Unit investment trusts (UITs) are registered under the [[wikipedia:Investment Company Act of 1940|Investment Company Act of 1940]]. While most ETF providers use the open end structure, a number of large ETFs used the UIT structure, for example SPDRs&lt;ref group="note"&gt;SPDR stands for Standard and Poor’s Depositary Receipts. It is a unit of an ETF that holds shares of all the companies in the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500 Composite Stock Price Index ([[S&amp;P 500 index]]). See also: [http://www.sec.gov/answers/spiders.htm Spiders (SPDRs)], from the SEC&lt;/ref&gt; and QQQs.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;QQQ is based on the NASDAQ-100 Index. See also: [https://www.invesco.com/qqq-etf/en/about.html About QQQ], from Invesco&lt;/ref&gt; Characteristics include:
# As a trust, the fund has no board of directors. The trust must be periodically renewed.
# The fund can only replicate an index.
# The fund cannot invest in derivatives.
# The fund cannot lend its securities.
# Dividends are not reinvested in the fund, but are held until paid to shareholders quarterly or annually. The ETF can suffer cash drag.
# Tax reporting is done with an IRS 1099 document.&lt;ref name="ETFGUide" /&gt;

===Grantor trust=== 
Grantor trusts&lt;ref name="ETFGUide" /&gt; are registered under the [[wikipedia:Securities Act of 1933|Securities Act of 1933]]. This structure is used for currency and commodity exchange traded vehicles. Characteristics include:
# The trust invests in a customized basket of securities that remains fixed (for HOLDRS stocks can be removed via merger and acquisition).
# The investor is considered as directly owning the underlying assets in the trust. Thus, the shareholder receives all company annual and semiannual reports, and all company proxies.
# Dividends are distributed directly to shareholders and are not reinvested.
# Tax reporting is done through a Grantor Trust Letter.
# Tax reporting can be complicated. Gold bullion and silver bullion ETFs are taxed as collectibles, subject to long term capital gains tax rates up to 28%, and the small sales of bullion used to pay trust expenses are considered taxable sales for shareholders that must be reported each year. In some instances, commodity ETFs using futures contracts must mark to market the futures positions at year end and investors are taxed each year on any gains, even if you do not sell the ETF. Capital gains on future contracts, regardless of holding period, are currently taxed at a hybrid rate of 60% long-term and 40% short-term gains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://etfguide.com/etfproductstructure.htm| title=ETF Product Structures| publisher=etfguide.com |url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130202063950/http://etfguide.com/etfproductstructure.htm| archive-date=February 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Etfguide.com states: "For investors in the highest tax bracket, this 60/40 split creates a maximum blended capital gains tax rate of 23%. The tax burden is reduced for investors in lower income brackets."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://etfguide.com/etfcommodity.htm| title=The Case for Commodities| publisher=etfguide.com| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130202063937/http://etfguide.com/etfcommodity.htm| archive-date=February 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exchange traded note===
{{Notice|The FINRA has released an investor alert about the risks involved when investing in Exchange traded notes (ETNs). See: [{{{url|https://web.archive.org/web/20181009094627/http://www.finra.org/investors/alerts/exchange-traded-notes-avoid-surprises}}} Exchange-Traded Notes - Avoid Unpleasant Surprises]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.finra.org/investors/alerts/exchange-traded-notes-avoid-surprises| title=Exchange-Traded Notes - Avoid Unpleasant Surprises| publisher=Financial Industry Regulatory Authority| date=July 10, 2012| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181009094627/http://www.finra.org/investors/alerts/exchange-traded-notes-avoid-surprises| archive-date=October 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Exchange traded notes (ETNs) are registered under the [[wikipedia:Securities Act of 1933|Securities Act of 1933]]. ETNs track a wide assortment of asset classes: stocks, bonds, currencies, commodities. Characteristics include:
# ETNs are senior, unsecured, unsubordinated debt securities issued by banks. They are subject to both investment risk and credit risk. In 2008, the failure of Lehman Brothers resulted in the delisting of the firm's three ETNs.
# ETNs track a benchmark index. At maturity an investor receives a cash payment equaling the performance of the benchmark, less fees. The most representative fee is 0.75% per year (range 0.30% - 0.89%).
# ETNs, as debt instruments, do not have a net asset value. However, current intrinsic value is expressed by an Intraday Indicative Value (IIV) computation.
# Most ETNs are considered by sponsors to be prepaid contracts, with tax liability deferred until maturity, liquidation, or sale by the investor. This tax status is subject to change at the discretion of the IRS; in 2007 the IRS ruled that currency note interest would be taxed as current income regardless of the fact that the payment of interest would not occur until maturity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/irb/2008-02_IRB/ar08.html| title=Internal Revenue Bulletin: 2008-2| publisher=IRS| date=January 14, 2008| accessdate=August 13, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ETFGUide" /&gt;

===Costs===
ETFs are subject to the costs of managing the portfolio as well as transaction costs when buying and selling the stock. Here is a breakdown of the costs you will incur:

*''[[Expense Ratios | Expense ratio]]'': the annual management fee for a mutual fund or ETF expressed as a percentage. It is charged directly to the fund/ETF.
*''Commission'': the up-front charge by your [[broker]] to buy or sell a stock or ETF.
*''[[Bid/ask spread]]'': the price difference between what a seller asks and what a buyer offers for a stock or ETF.
*''Premium and discount'': the difference between the trading price and the NAV of an ETF.

When buying or selling ETFs, consider using a [[Orders#Exchange Traded Funds | limit order]] to obtain the best price.

[https://www.nyse.com/listings_directory/etf The New York Stock Exchange] lists the daily closing bid-ask and premium-discount information for many popular ETFs. Select the ETF to view the latest quote.

===Taxes===
The ETF structure is likely to make stock ETFs more tax-efficient than stock mutual funds. 

When a mutual fund or ETF sells a stock, it has a taxable capital gain (or loss) equal to the difference between what it received and what it paid. When an institutional investor converts shares of an ETF to stock, the ETF provider can give away the shares of stock with the lowest purchase price; these are the shares which would have the highest gain if sold. Because of this, ETFs can often reduce the capital gains they must distribute. The ETF redemption process does not reduce dividends; therefore, taxable bond and REIT ETFs, asset classes with total returns comprised primarily of [[Non-qualified dividends | non-qualified dividend]] income, still have a high tax cost.

The redemption process is more effective at reducing capital gains when the ETF has purchased shares at a wide range of prices. As a result, many ETFs distributed capital gains in their first year or two of operations, but not subsequently; see the individual providers in the [[#ETF providers|ETF providers]] section for distribution information on individual ETFs.

A potential tax disadvantage to the creation-redemption process is that ETFs may redeem stocks which have paid a dividend before meeting the 61-day holding requirement for [[qualified dividend]]s. As a result, some ETFs have fewer qualified dividends than similar mutual funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{forum link| t=40143| title=Gus Sauter comments on Vanguard ETF structure}}, including quotes from Vanguard.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Most Vanguard ETFs have no tax advantage over the corresponding Vanguard index funds, because in most cases the ETF is a share class of the index fund and thus the mutual fund shares the tax benefits of the ETF. 

Many of Vanguard's ETFs were added as share classes to existing mutual funds and were able to avoid the first-year effect of distributing capital gains. FTSE All-World Ex US Small-Cap, which was created simultaneously as a fund and an ETF, distributed small gains in its first two years (2009 and 2010), and Consumer Staples Index also distributed a gain in its first year (2004). 

Only a few other Vanguard ETFs have distributed gains. REIT Index, which added an ETF class to an existing fund which generates a lot of gains, distributed gains in 2004-2008, 2016, and 2017. International Dividend Achievers Index, which changed indexes in 2021, distributed a 6% capital gain that year, half short-term.

===Risks===
With the global increase in the number of ETFs and the complexity of some of them (as is the case with [[Synthetic ETF]]s), three international bodies have expressed worries about them. See [http://www.economist.com/node/18864254 Too Much of a Good Thing, The risks created by Complicating a Simple Idea] in The Economist, June 23, 2011.

==How to convert mutual funds to ETFs at Vanguard==
{{See also|Vanguard Bond ETFs|Vanguard Domestic Sector ETFs|Vanguard Domestic Stock ETFs|Vanguard International ETFs}}

It is possible to convert conventional mutual fund shares to ETFs without any tax consequences. This is free at Vanguard, and is possible at other brokers which may charge a fee. To do this at Vanguard, you need to first open a Vanguard Brokerage Account to hold the ETF shares, then call Vanguard Brokerage to do the conversion over the phone.
{{Notice|
When converting from a mutual fund to an ETF, do not sell the fund if it has a gain or a taxable event will occur. Contact Vanguard and request a conversion, which will be done at NAV as an exchange from one type of share class to another.&lt;ref&gt;{{forum link| t=54843| title=Free ETFs at VG. But why ETFs?}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}
Redemption fees are not charged when you convert mutual fund shares to ETFs (or to Admiral shares). 

The conversion rate is determined by the closing NAV of the ETF (not market price) and the closing NAV of the mutual fund using the below formula. If this formula does not produce a whole number, you receive fractional ETF shares for the remainder. 

:Number of ETF shares = (number of mutual fund shares) &amp;times; (mutual fund NAV / ETF closing NAV)

Notice that the ETF market price is not in the equation. 

If you convert on a premium day, you will see a small uplift; if you convert on a discount day, you will see a small loss. But either way, conversion is based on the underlying NAVs, so everything evens out once the premium or discount changes. You are not actually selling and buying, so it should not make a difference in the long run.&lt;ref&gt;{{forum link| t=54920| title=Conversion of mutual funds to corresponding ETF question}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Here is the timeline from a user's experience of converting Vanguard funds held in a Vanguard IRA mutual fund account:&lt;ref&gt;{{forum link| p=732364| title=WellsTrade can convert Vanguard funds to ETFs for free}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{blockquote|
* Tuesday afternoon applied for VG brokerage accounts online
* Wednesday afternoon/evening sign some exchange agreements online to open the brokerage account.
* Thursday morning called Vanguard at 866-499-8473 to do the conversion of REIT and FTSE ex-US small index funds. 
* Friday AM the mutual fund shares disappeared (be prepared as you see a huge drop in your account balance)
* Saturday AM the ETF shares appeared, using above formula numbers were correct using Thursday's closing NAVs.

      <text bytes="16635" sha1="skizotci3r5nncrii3d6apofnh2bzjd" xml:space="preserve">An '''order''' is an instruction to buy or sell an [[exchange-traded fund]] (ETF) or [[stock]] on a trading venue such as a stock market, or bond market. These instructions can be simple or complicated, and for retail investors are generally sent to a [[broker]]. There are some standard instructions for such orders. While the [[Bogleheads Investment Philosophy]] does not recommend frequent trading or complex strategies, many investors do buy ETFs as long-term investments. All ETF traders should understand how the market works before buying or selling them. 

The least risky way to place an order for an ETF is to match the best current offer by placing a [[#Limit order | limit order]] to buy at the current best offer to sell (or vice versa). This is almost equivalent to a [[#Market order | market order]], which is an offer to buy (or sell) at the best price available at the time the order is placed, but it reduces the risk that you will pay too much if the offer you intended to match disappears before your order is placed.

{{Warning|This article is a basic introduction to the use of orders for trading. While there are many other ways to place an order, many of them are suitable only for experienced investors who understand the subtle complexities involved. In many cases, the extra complexities result in minimal savings, often at significant risk.}}

==Overview==
You have several options when it comes to placing an order to buy or sell securities. For example, whether you place an order directly with your broker or trade online, you can instruct your broker to buy or sell at a specified price. Understanding how different types of orders work may make a difference in whether your trade gets executed and at what price.&lt;ref group="note" name="SEC"&gt;From the [https://www.sec.gov/fast-answers/answersorderbd SEC]. "Stock" was replaced with "security" as the terms apply equally to both.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;See also: [[Stock Basics#Buying and selling | Buying and selling]] to understand how a broker executes trades.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unless otherwise stated, orders are placed for one trading day.&lt;ref group="note" name="RF"&gt;Information from a private message from [[Rick Ferri]], with permission to put details in the wiki.&lt;/ref&gt;

===A simplified view of the market===
The market contains all traders willing to buy or sell the security. If traders are willing to buy and sell at the same price, then a trade will be made. If you want to buy or sell, you add your own order to the market, and it will either be executed immediately or added to the available orders in the market.

Your broker will normally give you information about the market; with an online broker or real-time quote service, you might see a display like this:
{| class="wikitable"
|+ Example security
! Ticker !! Bid !! Ask !! Size
|- align="center"
|XYZ || 19.98 || 20.02 || 5 x 10
|}

The size is in hundreds of shares, so this display says that traders have offered to buy 500 shares of XYZ at $19.98, and to sell 1000 shares at $20.02. The [[bid/ask spread]] is four cents.

==The main types of orders==
===Market order===
A market order is an order to buy or sell a security at the current market price. Unless you specify otherwise, your broker will enter your order as a market order.

{{Notice|When you place a market order, you cannot control the price at which your order will be filled.&lt;ref group="note" name="SEC" /&gt;}}
The advantage of a market order is that you are almost always guaranteed your order will be executed (as long as there are willing buyers and sellers).

The disadvantage is that the price you pay when your order is executed may not always be the price you obtained from a real-time quote service or were quoted by your broker. This may be especially true in fast-moving markets where prices are more volatile. When you place an order "at the market," particularly for a large number of shares, there is a greater chance you will receive different prices for parts of the order.&lt;ref group="note" name="SEC"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

====Market order example====
Refer to the example security shown above. If you place a market order to buy 1000 shares, you will buy them for $20.02 a share ''if the sell order is still there''; your total price is $20,020.

However, the sell order might have been taken by another buyer, or withdrawn by the trader, before your broker processed your order. In that case, you will still buy the shares, but at the next-best price ''or prices''.

If there were 500 shares for sale at $20.04 and 2500 at $20.05, you would buy all the shares at $20.04 and 500 at $20.05, a total price of $20,045.

===Limit order===
To avoid buying or selling a security at a price higher or lower than you wanted, you need to place a limit order rather than a market order. A limit order is an order to buy or sell a security at a specific price. A ''buy limit'' order can only be executed at the limit price or lower, and a ''sell limit'' order can only be executed at the limit price or higher.

As stated earlier, when you place a market order, you cannot control the price at which your order will be filled. But by using a limit order you also protect yourself from buying the security at too high a price.&lt;ref group="note" name="SEC" /&gt;

Reaching the desired price does not automatically guarantee a sale, as every transaction must have both a buyer and seller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trade.asp| title=Trade Definition in Finance: Benefits and How It Works| publisher=Investopedia| accessdate=January 6, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt; When the security meets that price, you get in line with the rest of the people at that price and wait for execution. If there is low volume, you may not get an execution.&lt;ref group="note" name="RF"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

A common compromise between the two types of orders is a "marketable limit order". This is a limit order to buy at the current ask, or sell at the current bid. If the ask or bid is still there when your order is placed, it will execute immediately because there are now matched orders to buy and sell at the same price. But if the ask or bid has changed, your marketable limit order remains a limit order at the same price, instead of immediately executing at another price. 

====Limit order example====
Refer to the example security shown above. If you place a limit order to buy 1000 shares at $20.00, you may not buy them at all, but your order will become the new bid.

If someone else places a market order to sell, or a limit order to sell at $20.00, then you will buy the shares and pay $20,000. But if nobody accepts your order, you might find that XYZ has gone up to $21 and you still do not have the shares.

If you place a ''marketable'' limit order to buy 1000 shares at $20.02, you will buy the shares for that price if the sell order is still there, just as if you had placed a market order. 

But if the sell order is gone, you do not buy at a higher price; rather, your order is added to the market, and may be accepted by another trader at $20.02. You will not buy at a higher price ''unless you modify your order''.

==Special types of orders==
Most orders are market or limit orders, but there are other conditions you can place on an order. Any additional condition is an additional restriction, beyond the price, which limits whether the order will be executed.

===Stop order===
A stop order is an order to buy or sell a security once the price reaches a specified price, known as the stop price.&lt;ref group="note" name="SEC"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;. It may be entered as a [[#Market order | market order]] or a [[#Limit order | limit order]]; the most common stop order is the stop-loss order, which is entered as a market order to sell.

====Stop-loss order====
A ''stop-loss'' order is an order placed with a broker to ''sell'' a security when it reaches a certain price. A stop-loss order is designed to limit an investor's loss on a security position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stop-lossorder.asp| title=Stop-Loss Orders: One Way To Limit Losses and Reduce Risk| publisher=Investopedia| accessdate=January 6, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It does not guarantee a specific price. It means 'sell at any price' if the market price declines below a certain level.&lt;ref name="Stop"&gt;{{forum link| t=54982| title=How do sell stop loss orders and sell limit orders work?}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Stop-limit order====
A ''stop-limit'' order is an order to ''buy or sell'' a stock that combines the features of a [[#Stop order | stop order]] and a [[#Limit order | limit order]]. Once the stop price is reached, the stop-limit order becomes a limit order to buy or to sell at a specified price.&lt;ref group="note" name="SEC"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Take care when choosing the appropriate order.

For example, you purchase a stock and $32 and it rises to $40. To protect against a drop in price, you issue a stop sell ''market'' order at $32 (a 20% drop from the current price). The stock drops significantly below $32 and the market order triggers. However, the next available execution is at $27 (or worse!) and realize a 15% loss. Later in the day, the stock (which you no longer have) closes at $36 ($4 over the purchase price).&lt;ref name="Stop" /&gt;

===All-or-none===
An ''all-or-none'' order will not be executed unless it can be filled in full.

Refer to the example security shown above. If you place a limit order to sell 1000 shares at $19.98, you will sell 500 shares immediately, and your offer to sell the other 500 will become the new ask; it may be filled immediately, filled later, or not be filled at all.

If you place an all-or-none limit order, you will sell nothing unless a trader is willing to buy all 1000 shares. If your order does not fill immediately, another trader could buy the 500 shares at $19.98.

You can use all-or-none orders to avoid additional commissions. In the example above, if the first 500 shares are sold, and then you need to change the price to sell the remaining 500, you will pay a second commission. If you have to wait for the next day to sell the remaining shares at the same price, you will pay a second commission even if your order to sell was valid for multiple days. If a limit order fills on a single day in multiple transactions, you pay only one commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{forum link| t=55734| title=Multiple commissions on partially filed ETF orders}}. Contains additional insight about executing trades over several days.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The disadvantage is that the market may move away from you and you lose the benefit of a partial execution. If the price drops to $19.88, compare:
*A partial execution sale will get you $19,930 (minus two commissions) = $9,990 (500 shares @ $19.98) + $9,940 ( 500 shares @ $19.88)
*An all-or-none execution sale will get you $19,880 (minus one commission) = $19,880 (1000 shares @ $19.88)

A difference of $50 (minus one commission).

==Order risk summary==
An order has two risks: it may execute at an undesirable price: or it may not execute when you wanted it to.

A summary of orders and associated risks:&lt;ref name="Stop" /&gt;
*Limit orders
**Buy or sell as soon as possible, at a certain price or better
**Risks not getting executed
**If a sell order is not executed and price falls, you still have the security after the price drop
**If a buy order is not executed and price rises, you did not benefit from the rise
*Market orders
**Buy or sell as soon as possible at any price
**Will get executed
**When selling, risks a big decline in price (incur a large loss)
**When buying, risks a big increase in price (pay much more than you intended)

===Stop order risks===
A stop order becomes a market or limit order when it is triggered, so it has all the risks of a market or limit order. If prices are falling rapidly, a stop-loss order may execute well below the stop price for a large loss, while a stop-limit order may not execute at all because there are no buyers above the limit price after the stop.&lt;ref name="Stop" /&gt;

In addition, there is the risk that the stop price will be reached when you do not want the order to trigger. In a volatile market, a single trade below the stop price will trigger the order. 

==Exchange-traded funds==
When buying or selling [[:Exchange Traded Funds | ETFs]], you should use a [[#Limit order | limit order]] for the transaction. With a limit order you are able to specify the most that you are willing to pay for your shares. Ideally it would be best to buy at the [[Net asset value | NAV]], but that is rarely achievable. With most brokers, there is no additional fee to use a limit versus a market order, and you have some control over the price you pay.&lt;ref&gt;{{forum link| t=1883| title=Buy ETFs with Market or Limit Order?}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===A minimal risk approach===
The least risky way to buy an ETF, particularly one with low trading volume, is to place a ''marketable limit order'', an order to buy at the ask. This is almost equivalent to a market order, but reduces the risk if the offer at the ask is withdrawn and the next-lowest offer might be significantly higher.

Refer to the example security shown above. Assume XYZ is an ETF. A trader who was willing to sell at $20.02 withdraws his offer (or has someone else take it first), and places a new offer to sell at $20.03.

In the one second interval between the withdrawal of $20.02 and placement of $20.03, a next-best offer appears from someone else at $21.

If you place a limit order to buy 1000 shares at $20.02 during that one second, it will not execute, and so protect you from a purchase at the much higher price of $21. The new ask of $20.03 appears next and you modify your order to accept $20.03.

Compare this to a market order to buy 1000 shares. The $21 offer would have been accepted, resulting in a cost of $21,000 rather than $20,030 (a difference of $970).&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The same situation can occur with trades of an individual stock, but the value of an individual stock can also jump because of news about that stock. An ETF which holds a lot of stocks is likely to have its price move only by small amounts.&lt;/ref&gt;

===An alternative approach===
An alternative way to buy ETFs is with a day limit order that is in the middle of the [[Bid/ask spread | bid/ask spread]]. However, you may not get execution, or you may have to wait a long time for execution. Also, since the price could run away from you as you try to save a couple of dollars; there is an additional risk.&lt;ref group="note" name="RF"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea is that you want to purchase below "ask" price, but need to execute the order quickly before the market moves too much.&lt;ref&gt;{{forum link| t=54994| title=Limit Orders - How do you determine what limit to set?}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, an investor wished to purchase an ETF which had the following prices (valid only at a single time of day):
*Bid: 81.37
*Ask: 81.55

A limit order to buy at 81.45 did not execute. While the investor waited, "ask" moved from 81.55 to 81.68. The limit order was canceled and a new limit order for buy was placed at 81.60, which filled in a few seconds.

==Commodity ETFs==
There are some special considerations that apply to commodity ETFs.

Commodity ETFs often use a variety of ETF structures, for example:
* Grantor's trusts: Used especially for bullion based precious metals ETFs
* Exchange traded notes: Beware that an ETN bears credit risk, in that it is an obligation of the sponsoring bank
* Master limited partnership: These ETFs report their income tax obligations on corporate K-1 filings, not 1099 documents.&lt;ref name="complete_guide"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.indexuniverse.com/docs/110411IU_ETF_Taxation_v5A_%20j9.pdf| title=The Complete Guide to ETF Taxation| publisher=IndexUniverse| date=November 2011| accessdate=June 23, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commodity asset classes and fund structures also have some special tax considerations:
* Precious metals and grantor's trusts: The IRS considers precious metals to be collectibles. This means that you face a maximum 28% long term capital gains tax rate and a maximum 80% tax rate on these ETFs.
* Commodity futures have a 60/40 long term/short term blended tax obligation. This means that they have a maximum 23% long term capital gains tax rate and a maximum 23% short term maximum tax rate. Limited partnership ETFs are considered pass-through investments. Each year gains are marked-to-market and passed through to you as a potentially taxable obligation, regardless of whether you sell the shares or hold them.
* Exchange traded notes based on equity investments have a 15% long term capital gains rate and a maximum 80% short term capital gains rate.&lt;ref name="complete_guide" /&gt;

''Leveraged'' ETFs and ''Geared'' ETFs mean the same thing.&lt;/ref&gt; are ETF structures intended to provide returns that are positive or negative multiples of an equivalent ETF benchmark. The purpose of this article is to explain why these ETFs present significant risks as long-term investments.
{{Warning|The SEC and FINRA has issued a joint alert, "Leveraged and Inverse ETFs: Specialized Products with Extra Risks for Buy-and-Hold Investors." It states:&lt;ref name="SEC"&gt;{{cite web| publisher=Financial Industry Regulator Authority| url=http://www.finra.org/investors/alerts/leveraged-and-inverse-etfs-specialized-products-extra-risks-buy-and-hold-investors| title=Leveraged and Inverse ETFs: Specialized Products with Extra Risks for Buy-and-Hold Investors| date=August 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{blockquote|The SEC staff and FINRA are issuing this Alert because we believe individual investors may be confused about the performance objectives of leveraged and inverse exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Leveraged and inverse ETFs typically are designed to achieve their stated performance objectives on a daily basis. Some investors might invest in these ETFs with the expectation that the ETFs may meet their stated daily performance objectives over the long term as well. [...] Only invest if you are confident the product can help you meet your investment objectives and you are knowledgeable and comfortable with the risks associated with these specialized ETFs.}}}}

==Overview==
There are 3 structures:&lt;ref name="SEC" /&gt;

*'''Leveraged ETFs''' seek to deliver multiples of the performance of the index or benchmark they track.
*'''Inverse ETFs''' (also called "short" funds) seek to deliver the ''opposite'' of the performance of the index or benchmark they track.
*'''Leveraged inverse ETFs''' (also known as "ultra short" funds) seek to achieve a return that is a multiple of the inverse performance of the underlying index.

Here are several example ETF descriptions:
*'''ProShares UltraPro S&amp;P500 (UPRO)''' seeks daily investment results, before fees and expenses, that correspond to three times (3x) the daily performance of the S&amp;P 500&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.proshares.com/funds/upro.html ProShares ETFs: UltraPro S&amp;P500]&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''ProShares Ultra S&amp;P500 (SSO)''' seeks daily investment results, before fees and expenses, that correspond to two times (2x) the daily performance of the S&amp;P 500&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.proshares.com/funds/sso.html ProShares ETFs: Ultra S&amp;P500]&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''ProShares UltraShort S&amp;P500 (SDS)''' seeks daily investment results, before fees and expenses, that correspond to two times the inverse (-2x) of the daily performance of the S&amp;P 500&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.proshares.com/funds/sds.html ProShares ETFs: UltraShort S&amp;P500]&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Direxion Emerging Markets Bear 3X ETF (EDZ)''' seeks daily investment results, before fees and expenses, of 300% of the inverse (or opposite) of the performance of the MSCI Emerging Markets Index.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.direxionfunds.com/products/direxion-daily-emerging-markets-bear-3x-etf Direxion Daily Emerging Markets Bear 3x Shares]&lt;/ref&gt;

Let's look at the 4th example fund provider, Direxion. Notice that Direxion itself&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.direxionfunds.com/signs Leveraged ETF List | Direxion]&lt;/ref&gt; says these funds are for "short-term trading." This is not a detail or a pro forma disclaimer - it is explicitly displayed in the figure below.

{|style="border-collapse: collapse;" border="1"    &lt;!-- set border="1" to see table boundaries, outer table draws outside border.  --&gt;
|+'''Direxion ETF Fund Categories'''
||
[[image:Direxionsayshorterm.png]]
|}

The first category, "Long Term Investment" contains 3 ETFs which match a benchmark. The second category contains 2 leveraged ETFs ("3X") and is titled "Short Term Trading" which is a warning sign that these ETFs will perform differently than those intended for long-term investments. The link "Are Direxion Shares ETFs for you?" is an additional warning sign, as there would be no reason to ask this question if these ETFs performed similarly to ETFs intended for long-term investments.

Brokerages typically require customers to sign a special disclaimer in order to open a margin account. Everyone understands that using leverage in the form of a margin account is taking on a big risk, the risk of losing more than your total investment. It is a mistake to think you can get essentially similar results, more conveniently and without the risk of losing more than your investment, simply by using an inverse or leveraged ETF.

Anyone thinking of using an inverse or leveraged ETF needs to read and understand the fund company's factsheets and prospectus, which disclose the issues in language varying from veiled to clear.

==How does a daily leveraged ETF work?==
A daily leveraged ETF holds a combination of derivatives and actual securities to track a multiple of the underlying index's daily performance.

Let's examine ProShares UltraPro S&amp;P500 (UPRO), which promises to deliver 3x the daily performance of the S&amp;P 500. It does this by holding 77% individual S&amp;P 500 stocks, nominal exposure to 215% of the S&amp;P 500 through total return swaps, and 8% S&amp;P futures. Add it all up, and you get exposure to 300% of the S&amp;P 500’s daily performance.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.proshares.com/resources/prospectus_reports.html ProShares Geared Funds Annual] 5/31/2019, market exposure on printed page LIX.&lt;/ref&gt;

Total return swaps are contracts between the ETF and major investment banks. For UPRO, every day the banks pay the ETF the value of the S&amp;P 500’s total return for that day, and in return the ETF pays the banks a pre-negotiated rate of interest, which is close to the short term treasury rate.  As of May 2019, the borrowing rate of some UPRO's swap agreements was 3.01%.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.proshares.com/resources/prospectus_reports.html ProShares Geared Funds Annual] 5/31/2019, swap agreements on printed page 138, e.g. BNP Paribas rate as of May 31, 2019.&lt;/ref&gt; The corresponding cost is NOT included in UPRO's 0.92% expense ratio.

==Daily results are significantly different than long-term==
It is critical to understand that a movement in one direction followed by an equal movement in the opposite direction will '''not''' get you back to the starting value. For example, a gain of 10% followed by a loss of 10% will end up with a loss of 1.0%.&lt;ref name="ReturnCalc"&gt;Details are in this {{Forum post| p=4882043|title = Re: &lt;nowiki&gt;[Wiki article update - Inverse and leveraged ETFs]&lt;/nowiki&gt; |author = LadyGeek | date = December 9, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is nothing but math at work. The math works the same for any investment – regardless if it’s a single stock or a fund. See [[Percentage gain and loss]] for the details.

This math will be very evident as a fund performs over time. If the market has equal gains and losses over a period of time, the fund’s value will always be lower. For example, 6 consecutive days which alternate as +10% then -10% will result in a loss of 3.0%.&lt;ref name="ReturnCalc" /&gt; The change in loss from 1.0% to 3.0% is known as ''volatility decay''.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Also known as [[volatility drag]], but ''volatility decay'' is the term used for leveraged funds.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the course of a single day, the fund will generate a return as advertised. For example, a 3X leveraged fund will generate three times the gain (and loss) of an unleveraged fund.

However, that’s not the entire story. Leveraged funds [[rebalance]] their exposure to their underlying benchmarks on a daily basis by trimming or adding to their positions. Over time, a longer-term investor is unlikely to continue to receive the fund's multiple of the benchmark's returns.&lt;ref name="ProShares"&gt;{{cite web| publisher=ProShares| url=https://www.proshares.com/funds/performance/the_universal_effects_of_compounding.html| title=Effects Of Daily Rebalancing and Compounding on Geared Investing| accessdate=December 9, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Investment returns compound over time. The effects of compounding will also cause the fund to deviate from the fund's stated objective, e.g. 2X or 3X of the index's return. In trending periods, compounding can enhance returns, but in volatile periods, compounding may hurt returns. Generally speaking, the greater the multiple or more volatile a fund's benchmark, the more pronounced the effects can be.&lt;ref name="ProShares" /&gt;

It is why the fund’s fact sheets have disclaimers stating that performance is only guaranteed on a daily basis.

==A comprehensive example==

Now, let's illustrate how big the difference is between "daily" and long-term results.

Some investors think they see interesting theoretical possibilities for using [[leverage]] in long-term investing.  If so, they should '''not''' think that over long periods of time they can get double the return of the S&amp;P 500 simply by investing in a 2X leveraged S&amp;P 500 ETF. 

The word "daily" has a very precise meaning. These products double or triple the long or short index for a single day, so '''if you are someone who trades in and out of positions on a daily basis''', they actually do pretty much what you'd expect. Not so over long periods, '''and the difference can be large'''.

The ETF companies disclose this point fairly clearly in the factsheets, such as:

{{blockquote|'''Direxion:''' "This leveraged ETF seeks a return that is -300% the return of its benchmark index for a single day. The fund should not be expected to provide three times the return of the benchmark’s cumulative return for periods greater than a day.", and&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

'''ProShares:''' "Due to the compounding of daily returns, ProShares' returns over periods other than one day will likely '''differ in amount''' and possibly '''&lt;nowiki&gt;[differ in]&lt;/nowiki&gt; direction''' from the target return for the same period."}}

In order to illustrate  the potential impact, let's ask: "'''How much is that in dollars?'''" which is quantified in the following sections.

==="differ in amount"===
"Differ in amount" means that the "2X" fund might not deliver twice the return of the index. For example, ProShares Ultra S&amp;P 500 ETF, SSO began in 6/2007. $10,000 invested in the Vanguard 500 Index fund would have gained a total of $6,966 in total return since that time (6/20/2006 to 12/31/2013). Did the Ultra fund earn twice that ($13,932)?

{|style="border-collapse: collapse;" border="1"    &lt;!-- set border="1" to see table boundaries, outer table draws outside border.  --&gt;
|+'''Comparison of ProShares Ultra S&amp;P 500 (SSO) to Vanguard 500 Index (VFINX)'''
||[[image:Vfinx-beats-sso.png]]
|}

It did not. It earned $6,097, which is less than the Vanguard 500 Index fund earnings. ''The 2X ETF earned less than the straight, unleveraged, direct investment.''

==="differ in direction"===
This is a way of saying that over periods of more than a day, your ETF could go down even when the inverse or leveraged index it is tied to goes up. This is why ProShares says "Investors should monitor their holdings consistent with their strategies, as frequently as daily."

We will illustrate with a deliberately-picked and unusual period of time (12/31/2007 to 12/31/2010), but it is a valid illustration of the effect of volatility decay on a leveraged ETF. Before showing the results, here is a question. 

Over this time period, an investment of $10,000 in Vanguard 500 Index fund lost $846. Knowing this, which of these three investments do you think did the best over that time period?

:a) Vanguard 500 Index Fund (VFINX)
:b) ProShares Ultra S&amp;P (SSO), "two times (2x) the daily performance of the S&amp;P 500"
:c) ProShares UltraShort S&amp;P (SDS), "two times the inverse (-2x) of the daily performance of the S&amp;P 500."

'''The answer is (a)'''. If you reasoned that since the S&amp;P 500 lost money, an ETF that shorts the S&amp;P ought to have made money, you were mistaken.

*The Vanguard 500 index fund lost $846. 
*ProShares Ultra S&amp;P (SSO), the 2X ETF for the same index lost. But it didn't lose just twice as much as VFINX, it lost over four times as much-- $4,050.
*ProShares UltraShort S&amp;P (SDS), the 2X short ETF (-2X, gains if benchmark drops) which should have earned a profit, lost even more -- $4,595.

Over this time period, you could have been right about the ''direction'' of the S&amp;P but still lost money. And this isn't just a matter of a few percent or an expense ratio difference, ''the loss is more than 4.8 times the amount of an unleveraged direct investment''.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The loss is 4.8 times = 4050/846 for the 2X ETF, 5.4 times = 4,595/846 for the short -2X ETF.&lt;/ref&gt;

||[[image:Vfinx-sso-ssd-heads-you-lose-tails-you-lose.png]]
|}

==Historical drawdowns==
A major risk presented by leveraged funds is how the impact of stock market crises can get magnified. Drawdowns (sudden loss of value) will get amplified in both depth and duration. The following chart (1955-2019) presents a simulation of a regular index fund, a 2x leverage fund and a 3x leverage, all tracking the S&amp;P 500 index. As you can see, the oil crisis in the 70s would have been magnified with dizzying drops and drawdowns lasting more than a decade. The more recent Internet and financial crises would have led to nearly two decades of misery, finally followed by a steep recovery. Staying the course with a long term investment in leveraged funds during such a crisis would seem extremely challenging.&lt;ref name="blog"&gt;[https://finpage.blog/2019/12/12/leveraging-sp-500-quantitative-analysis/ Bogleheads blog (2019): Leveraging S&amp;P 500 – Quantitative Analysis]&lt;/ref&gt;

{|
[[File:S&amp;P 500 LETF Drawdowns.jpg|960px]]
|}

==Risks and rewards==
As clearly illustrated by the charts in previous sections, leveraged (and inverse) ETFs are much more volatile than corresponding indices (and index funds). Between Jan-10 and Dec-19, the standard deviation of monthly returns was amplified by approximately the amount of leverage:&lt;ref name="blog"/&gt;
* VFIAX (regular S&amp;P 500 passive index fund from Vanguard): 12.5%
* SSO (ProShares Ultra S&amp;P500, 2x leverage): 25.3%
* UPRO (ProShares UltraPro S&amp;P500, 3x leverage): 38.4%

A historical simulation of leveraged funds over the 1955 to 2019 time period showed similar characteristics:&lt;ref name="blog"/&gt;
* Regular S&amp;P 500 passive fund: 14.4%
* S&amp;P 500 2x leverage: 29.0%
* S&amp;P 500 3x leverage: 43.6%

The question becomes the following. If a steely investor had been able to cope with such increased volatility (including dizzying drawdowns), what would have been the rewards for staying the course? Real-life funds would have provided attractive annualized growth from 2010 to 2019 (VFIAX 13.5%, SSO 23.6%, UPRO 32.8%), but this isn't a terribly representative time period, since it was essentially a long bull market. 

Using the historical simulation, we can study rolling (annualized) returns over a much longer time frame, including three major crises of the US stock market.&lt;ref name="blog"/&gt;

{|
[[File:Rolling_Periods_CAGR_Stats_Leveraging_2x_3x.jpg|960px]]
|}

As the table indicates, over short periods of time, leveraging can deliver stronger returns, albeit with a lot of risk. Over longer periods, the return premium disappears on average while the risk (dispersion of outcomes) remains very acute. Overall, the case for rewards (i.e. improved annualized returns) seems remarkably weak for long-term buy and hold investments, compared to the volatility and drawdown risks previously quantified.

==Summary==
Regardless of what you might or might not think about the possible usefulness of a long-term [[leverage|leveraged]] position achieved by using margin, leveraged and inverse ETFs are completely different products and do not give remotely comparable results. 

In short, leveraged and inverse ETFs are specialized products, which present major risks as long-term buy and hold investments and little rewards in return for such risks. The use of such products as part of a regular asset allocation should be discouraged.

==Other points of view==
Long-term risks associated with a specific asset can sometimes be mitigated by the use of another asset (e.g. using rebalancing and risk parity strategies&lt;ref&gt;Investopedia: [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/risk-parity.asp Risk Parity]&lt;/ref&gt;). These are sophisticated portfolios, constructed by investors who fully understand all the risks described above; they accept the irreducible potential risk of any portfolio, no matter how carefully constructed, that contains high-risk assets.

An article in the ''Journal of Indexes,'' authored by Joanne Hill and George Foster, both of ProShares, note that "it is likely that leveraged and inverse ETFs are commonly being utilized as short-term tactical trading tools" but state that, nevertheless, by applying certain rebalancing strategies, "leveraged and inverse funds have been and can be used successfully for periods longer than one day." The article, "Understanding Returns of Leveraged and Inverse Funds",&lt;ref&gt;Hill, Joanne, and George Foster (2009), [http://www.indexuniverse.com/publications/journalofindexes/joi-articles/6414-understanding-returns-of-leveraged-and-inverse-funds.html?showall=&amp;fullart=1&amp;start=7 Understanding Returns of Leveraged and Inverse Funds]. Dr. Hill is Head of Investment Strategy at ProShares; George Foster is Chief Investment Officer.&lt;/ref&gt; gives a detailed analysis of how volatility affects leveraged and inverse ETFs.

Another article authored by Cliff Asness, from AQR Capital Management, "Risk Parity: Why We Lever",&lt;ref&gt;Click Asness (2014), [https://www.aqr.com/Insights/Perspectives/Risk-Parity-Why-We-Fight-Lever Risk Parity: Why We Lever].&lt;/ref&gt; advocates that "willingness to use modest leverage allows a risk parity investor to build a more diversified, more balanced, higher-return-for-the-risk-taken portfolio."

Synthetic ETFs are an advanced investing concept and not recommended for new investors. They use derivatives and other products, and these hold extra levels of risk. In addition, they are not as well regulated as ETFs that hold stocks and bonds. If you are considering using synthetic ETFs, it is important to understand these risks. Please ask in the forum for guidance.
}}
A '''synthetic ETF''' is a fund that mimics the behavior of an [[exchange-traded fund]] (ETF) by using derivatives such as swaps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/synthetic-etf.asp| title=Synthetic Exchange-Traded Fund: What it is, How it Works| publisher=Investopedia| accessdate=October 21, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==ETF structures==
There are two main structures for ETFs.
* Physical ETFs are "plain-vanilla" products that replicate the index by simply holding the index's securities (for example, the [[S&amp;P 500 index]] stocks) with appropriate weight.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;To limit transaction costs caused by rebalancing, physical ETFs often hold a sample of the index's securities, rather than the full set. An ETF may also generate some income from securities lending.&lt;/ref&gt; These are the most common form of ETF, especially in the US, and the main providers are large independent asset managers.&lt;ref name="FSB"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.fsb.org/2011/04/potential-financial-stability-issues-arising-from-recent-trends-in-exchange-traded-funds-etfs/| title=Potential Financial Stability Issues Arising From Recent Trends in Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs)| publisher=Financial Stability Board| accessdate=October 21, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Synthetic ETFs do not own the index's securities, but instead replicate an index using derivatives.&lt;ref name="BISpaper"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.bis.org/publ/work343.pdf| title=Market structures and systemic risks of exchange-traded funds| publisher=BIS Working Paper No. 343| date=2011| accessdate=October 21, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One popular synthetic structure uses total return swaps,&lt;ref group="note"&gt;A total return swap is a bilateral financial transaction where the counterparties swap the total return of a single asset or basket of assets for periodic cash flows, typically a floating rate such as [[wikipedia:SOFR|SOFR]].&lt;/ref&gt; which the ETF sponsors refer to as the ''unfunded swap structure''.

Here, the authorised participant receives the creation units from the ETF sponsor against cash, rather than a basket of the index securities as in physical replication. The ETF sponsor separately enters into a total return swap with a financial intermediary, often its parent bank, to receive the total return of the ETF index for a given nominal exposure. This constitutes the first leg of the swap.

Cash is then transferred to the swap counterparty equal to the notional exposure. In return, the swap counterparty transfers a basket of collateral assets to the ETF sponsor. The assets in the collateral basket could be completely different from those in the benchmark index that the ETF tries to replicate. The total return on this collateral basket is then transferred to the swap counterparty, which constitutes the second leg of the total return swap.&lt;ref name="BISpaper"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of risk==
Synthetic ETFs have the following additional risks: counterparty risk; collateral risk; liquidity risk; and potential conflicts of interest.

'''Nathan Most''' (March 22, 1914 - December 3, 2004) is best known to investors as the creator of the first U.S. [[Exchange-traded fund|exchange-traded fund]], the Standard &amp; Poor’s Depository Receipt based on the [[S&amp;P 500 index]]. Most was born in Los Angeles, California, received a bachelor's degree from the University of California, Los Angeles. He died in San Mateo, California.&lt;ref name="Bayot"&gt;{{cite web| author=Jennifer Bayot| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/10/obituaries/nathan-most-is-dead-at-90-investment-fund-innovator.html| title=Nathan Most Is Dead at 90; Investment Fund Innovator| publisher=The New York Times| date=December 4, 2004| accessdate=December 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Most held numerous positions during his career. He was an executive vice president of Pacific Vegetable Oil from 1965 to 1970 and an executive vice president of the American Import Company from 1970 to 1974. He shifted to the investment world in 1974, becoming president of the Pacific Commodities Exchange from 1974 to 1976; later that year he became technical assistant to the chairman of the Commodities Futures Trading Commission. He joined the American Stock Exchange in 1977, eventually serving as director of product development.&lt;ref name="Bayot"/&gt; It was with the American Stock Exchange in 1993 that Most and his team designed the exchange-traded fund. His last position was at Barclays Global Investors, where he served as a board member of the iShares Trust.&lt;ref name="Spence"&gt;{{cite web| author=John Spence| url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/etf-inventor-nate-most-dies-at-90| title=ETF inventor Most dies at 90| publisher=Market Watch| date=December 7, 2004| accessdate=December 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The meeting with John Bogle==
Both Most and [[John Bogle]] recount a notable meeting in 1992. According to Bogle, Most visited him at his Valley Forge office offering  "...a design for a new “product” in which shares of the Vanguard 500 Index Fund could be traded instantaneously throughout the market day, and proposed that we partner with him... I listened to his presentation with interest and gave him my reactions: (1) there were three or four flaws in the design that would have to be corrected in order for the idea to actually function; and (2) even if the new design solved the problems, our Index 500 Fund was designed for long-horizon investors."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=John Bogle| url=https://money-markets-blog.amazon.com/post/Tx1J1WCZ8ZAV10O/A-Brief-History-of-the-ETF| title=A Brief History of the ETF| publisher=Amazon.com Money &amp; Markets| date=March 31, 2013| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130414021427/https://money-markets-blog.amazon.com/post/Tx1J1WCZ8ZAV10O/A-Brief-History-of-the-ETF| archive-date=April 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Most, Bogle didn't like the concept because traders moving in and out of the funds would drive up costs. "That conversation got me thinking about a product where you don't go in and out of the fund."&lt;ref name="Spence"/&gt;

'''Exchange-traded funds (ETFs)''' have become increasingly popular due to their low barrier to entry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/15/business/why-are-some-mutual-funds-changing-into-etfs.html|title=Why are some mutual funds changing into ETFs?|publisher=The New York Times|date=January 15, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; Major brokerages such as [[Fidelity]], [[Schwab]] and [[Vanguard]] offer access to all [[ETFs]] without fees or investment minimums, resulting in a wide variety of choices for investors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/13/battle-for-client-assets-heats-up-as-brokers-cut-fees-to-zero.html|title=Battle for client assets heats up as brokers cut fees to zero|publisher=CNBC|date=October 13, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; This article provides a comparison of core [[Indexing|index ETFs]] for [[Bogleheads investment philosophy|Boglehead-style]] investing.

When choosing between [[ETFs]], it is important to consider the [[expense ratio]] (ER). This page offers a condensed menu of low-expense-ratio ETFs that investors commonly use as core holdings to build a [[lazy portfolios|passive — or "lazy" — portfolio]]. In each category, up to three low-cost, liquid ETFs are shown for comparison from several fund companies.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Liquidity or demand for a fund influences the price at which you buy and sell that fund on the market. This is known as the [[bid/ask spread]]. It should not impact your decision to buy and sell ETFs: the spread is usually small (~ 0.01%) for widely-traded ETFs. There are notes for certain categories where you might encounter larger spreads.&lt;/ref&gt;
