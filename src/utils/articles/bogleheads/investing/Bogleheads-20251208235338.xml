'''{{PAGENAME}}''' ("PenFed") is a non-profit credit union that serves 1.2 million members&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.penfed.org/about-penfed|title=About Pentagon Federal Credit Union|access-date=2023-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the Air Force, Army, Coast Guard, Department of Homeland Security, Department of Defense, defense-related companies, and the Veterans of Foreign Wars. It was Federally chartered in 1935. It offers a variety of financial services including checking and savings accounts, [[certificate of deposit]] (CDs), mortgages and [[credit cards]]. 

==Membership eligibility==
Anyone can join if they are in the United States Military &amp; Uniformed Services, an employee of a qualifying organization, an employee of the United States government, or meet the qualifications listed in [https://netmember3.penfed.org/NetMember/Forms/OpenAccounts/Eligibility.aspx?MEMBERSHIP How Are You Eligible For PenFed Membership?].

You can also join by paying a $20 membership fee to the National Military Family Association, or $15 to the Voices for America's Troops.

==Deposit Anywhere checking accounts==

[https://www.penfed.org/deposit-anywhere/ Deposit Anywhere], for on-line banking, includes check scanning capabilities. The Deposit Anywhere service can be used in conjunction with a scanner to deposit up to $5,000 per member per day. Members will need to scan the front and back of their check to receive immediate credit without having to mail the check to a PenFed location for processing.

==CDs==
PenFed offers competitive [[CD#PenFed | CD]] rates, which is ideal for holding all or part of an [[IRA]] (that you wish to invest in CDs).See: [https://www.penfed.org/money-market-certificate/ Money Market Certificates].

==IRA early withdrawals==
There are no penalties for early withdrawal if you take a partial withdrawal or qualified distribution. However, there are early redemption penalties for non-qualified withdrawals. See: [https://www.penfed.org/Traditional-IRA-Certificates/ IRA Certificates].

==Other products==
{{Warning|Some forum members have had poor experiences obtaining PenFed mortgages. See: {{forum link| t=140854| title=Experience with PenFed refinance}}}}
===Mortgages===
Penfed also offers mortgages. All fixed rate mortgages have a 1% origination fee.&lt;ref name="mortgage"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.penfed.org/mortgage-center| title=Home Loans &amp; Financing - Low Mortgage &amp; Refinancing Rates| accessdate=August 8, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to 10-, 15-, 20-, and 30-year fixed rate mortgages, PenFed also has a unique 5/5 ARM product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.penfed.org/55-Adjustable-Rate-Mortgage/| title=5/5 Adjustable Rate Mortgage (ARM)| accessdate=June 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 5/5 ARM offers:
* Adjustable Rate Mortgage with a low rate that only adjusts every 5 years for 30 years
* Rate would adjust up to 2% or our prevailing rate, whichever is the lowest
* Maximum lifetime adjustment that will not exceed 5% above the initial rate

Because the rate only adjusts every five years, with a 2% cap, the 5/5 ARM is a good alternative to the more common 5/1 ARM offered elsewhere. PenFed also offers 5/1 and 15/15 ARM.&lt;ref name="mortgage" /&gt;

==Rebate credit card==
PenFed offers a competitive reward credit card, the PenFed Platinum Rewards Visa Signature® Card,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=https://www.penfed.org/credit-cards/platinum-rewards-visa| title=PenFed Platinum Rewards Visa Signature® Card| access-date=2023-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; which gives a 5% rebate for gas paid at the pump and EV charging stations, 3% for supermarket (including most Target and Walmart locations), restaurants, and TV, radio, cable, streaming services purchases, and 1% for everything else. The rebate is automatically credited to a statement every month.

{{Notice|
This is an advanced investing topic. Hedge funds are not recommended for retirement portfolios and should only be considered by experienced investors who are willing to accept a high level of risk (see [[#Investment risk| below]]). Please ask in the forum for advice.
}}

A '''hedge fund''' is an investment fund that can undertake a wider range of investment and trading activities than other funds, but which is only open for investment from particular types of investors specified by regulators. These investors are typically institutions, such as pension funds, university endowments and foundations, or high net worth individuals. As a class, hedge funds invest in a diverse range of assets, but they most commonly trade liquid securities on public markets. They also employ a wide variety of investment strategies, and make use of techniques such as [http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortselling.asp#axzz1h1IJLGX5 short selling] and [[Leverage | leverage]].&lt;ref name="WikiHF"&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedge_fund Hedge fund], from Wikipedia&lt;/ref&gt;

''Like'' [[Mutual fund|mutual funds]], hedge funds pool investors' money and invest those funds in financial instruments in an effort to make a positive return. Many hedge funds seek to profit in all kinds of markets by pursuing [[Leverage |leveraging]] and other speculative investment practices that may increase the risk of investment loss.&lt;ref name="SEChf"&gt;[http://www.sec.gov/answers/hedge.htm Hedging Your Bets: A Heads Up on Hedge Funds and Funds of Hedge Funds], from the [http://www.sec.gov/index.htm U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission] (SEC)&lt;/ref&gt;

''Unlike'' mutual funds, however, hedge funds are ''not'' required to register with the SEC. Hedge funds typically issue securities in “private offerings” that are not registered with the SEC under the Securities Act of 1933. In addition, hedge funds are not required to make periodic reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. But hedge funds are subject to the same prohibitions against fraud as are other market participants, and their managers have the same fiduciary duties as other investment advisers.&lt;ref name="SEChf" /&gt; (Superseded by the Dodd-Frank legislation, see [[#U. S. regulation | below]].)

Hedge fund investors do not receive all of the federal and state law protections that commonly apply to most registered investments. For example, you won't get the same level of disclosures from a hedge fund that you'll get from registered investments. Without the disclosures that the securities laws require for most registered investments, it can be quite difficult to verify representations you may receive from a hedge fund. You should also be aware that, while the SEC may conduct examinations of any hedge fund manager that is registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act, the SEC and other securities regulators generally have limited ability to check routinely on hedge fund activities.&lt;ref name="SEChf" /&gt;

Hedge funds are commonly classified as a unique asset class, much like commodities, private equity, and other “alternative” investments. Yet ''unlike'' other asset classes, hedge funds ''do not'' share unique structural characteristics (e.g., bonds represent a loan to a company or government agency, and stocks represent ownership in a corporation). Consequently, you should not think of hedge funds should as an alternative asset class, but rather as ''investment strategies'' that trade existing asset classes to generate returns.&lt;ref name ="VG"&gt;[https://institutional.vanguard.com/iip/pdf/hedgefunds_012005.pdf Understanding Alternative Investments: A Primer on Hedge Fund Evaluation] by Christopher B. Philips, Vanguard Investment Counseling &amp; Research (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strategies==
Hedge funds, in short, are largely unregulated, private pools of capital. Hedge fund managers can invest in a broad array of assets and pursue many investment strategies such as
''global macro'', ''market neutral equity'',&lt;ref name="Discrepancy"&gt;Wikipedia, Vanguard, and the NY Fed Report differ in this category. Directional, non-directional, and market neutral approaches are defined.&lt;/ref&gt; ''convertible arbitrage'', or ''event-driven''.&lt;ref name="FedNY"&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=995907 Hedge Funds, Financial Intermediation, and Systemic Risk], Kambhu, Stiroh, and Schuermann. Federal Reserve Bank of NY, August 1, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

These four categories are distinguished by investment style and have their own risk and return characteristics. Managed futures or multi-strategy funds may not fit into these categories, but are nonetheless popular strategies with investors. It is possible for hedge funds to commit to a certain strategy or employ multiple strategies to allow flexibility, for risk management purposes, or to achieve diversified returns. The hedge fund’s prospectus, also known as an offering memorandum, offers potential investors information about key aspects of the fund, including the fund's investment strategy, investment type, and leverage limit.&lt;ref name="WikiHF" /&gt;

Although no two funds or strategies are exactly alike, many funds operate within a common framework, namely using offsetting positions to control one or more identified risk factors. In fact, Alfred Winslow Jones formed the first hedge fund in 1949&lt;ref&gt;From [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedge_fund Wikipedia] (not in Vanguard publication): Sociologist, author, and financial journalist Alfred W. Jones is credited with coining the phrase "hedged fund", in contrast to prior nomenclatures, but is often erroneously credited with creating the first hedge fund structure in 1949.&lt;/ref&gt; - hedging long stock positions by shorting other positions - in order to mitigate the gyrations in the equity market. Jones’s model was based on the premise that performance depends more on stock selection than market direction. This practice of hedging market risk remains common in today’s hedge fund environment.&lt;ref name ="VG" /&gt;

== Characteristics ==
While strategies and individual hedge funds are quite heterogeneous, it is useful to focus on four broad characteristics that distinguish them from other types of money management funds.&lt;ref name="FedNY" /&gt;

First, hedge funds are not restricted by the type of trading strategies and financial instruments they may use. In particular, hedge funds can and do make use of short selling, derivatives, and options, all of which are complex and potentially nonlinear in payoffs.&lt;ref name="FedNY" /&gt;

Second, hedge funds make liberal use of leverage, be it directly through the use of debt or indirectly through leverage embedded in derivatives. This freedom is possible because hedge
funds in the United States largely fall outside of the regulatory umbrella by virtue of being open only to accredited investors and large institutions.&lt;ref name="FedNY" /&gt;

Hedge fund investors and counterparties impose some discipline on the amount of leverage actually employed. This discipline, however, may be limited by the third key characteristic - opacity to outsiders - which again is in large part due to their unregulated nature.&lt;ref name="FedNY" /&gt;

Finally, hedge fund managers are typically compensated based on both scale and absolute performance through a dual fee structure, e.g., the “2-and-20” set-up where managers retain 2% of the net asset value of the fund and 20% of returns above some benchmark.&lt;ref name="FedNY" /&gt;

=== Opacity ===
Opacity is not unique to hedge funds as financial institutions generally, and banks especially, are thought to be more opaque than firms in other industries. Financial firms,
however, often have traded instruments such as equity shares or bonds outstanding, so they are subjected to further scrutiny by market participants. By contrast, hedge funds, due to their
unregulated and private nature, are not subject to such wide scrutiny unless they chose to issue public securities. Moreover, the success of a hedge fund often depends on proprietary
trading strategies which, if made public, can be used by others to trade against them. Investors know this and are thus willing to tolerate a degree of opacity not seen in the mutual
fund industry in the hope of securing particularly rich returns.&lt;ref name="FedNY" /&gt;

==== U.S. regulation ====
Effective July 21, 2011 for all registered advisers, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act aims to increase regulation of financial companies, including hedge funds. The act requires advisers with private pools of capital exceeding $150 million or more in assets to register with the SEC as investment advisers and become subject to all rules which apply to registered advisers. Under Dodd-Frank, hedge fund managers who have less than $100 million in assets under management will be overseen by the state where the manager is domiciled and become subject to state regulation. This will significantly increase the number of hedge funds under state supervision, as the threshold for SEC regulation was previously $30 million.&lt;ref name="WikiHF" /&gt;

In response to Dodd-Frank, some of the larger hedge funds have gone entirely private; closing to outside investors and only trading their owner's money.&lt;ref&gt;One example is George Soros, discussed in [http://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=1254968#p1254968 Wiki Update - Hedge Funds], direct link to post.&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Compensation ===
The compensation structure of hedge funds differs markedly from other institutional investors such as mutual funds. In particular, hedge fund traders and managers tend to be compensated more on absolute return and scale, while their brethren in institutional investing typically have their compensation tied to performance relative to some benchmark
such as the S&amp;P 500. In addition, hedge fund managers have added optionality in the form of hurdle rates (no incentive fee if returns are below the hurdle rate) and high water marks
(incentive fee only on new profits, i.e., after past losses are made up), making payoffs potentially very convex and therefore asymmetric: gains and losses are treated differently. This convex payoff structure provides strong incentives for hedge fund managers to take on risk and leverage. Although incentive fees also play an important role in the mutual fund industry, they are required by law to be symmetric in the U.S.&lt;ref name="FedNY" /&gt;

== Investment risk ==
While in theory hedge funds enhance the risk-adjusted returns of traditional portfolios, they are also often acknowledged to be potentially risky investments. Because of their potential pitfalls, hedge funds should be viewed as long-term investments.&lt;ref name ="VG" /&gt;

Although "hedging" is actually the practice of attempting to reduce risk, the goal of most hedge funds is to maximize return on investment. Nowadays, hedge funds use dozens of different strategies, so it isn't accurate to say that hedge funds just "hedge risk". In fact, because hedge fund managers make speculative investments, these funds can carry ''more'' risk than the overall market.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hedgefund.asp Hedge Fund], from Investopedia&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, there is a growing amount of literature which substantiates conclusions that hedge fund returns are predominately determined by exposure to common risk factors, not manager skill. ''Investors seeking higher returns should avoid hedge funds, and gain access to the risk factors they want in lower cost ways, such as index or other low-cost, passively managed funds.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505123_162-57344189/the-way-to-predict-hedge-fund-returns/?tag=mncol;lst;1 The way to predict hedge fund returns], by [[Larry Swedroe]], CBSmoneywatch.com, 16-Dec-11&lt;/ref&gt;

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' shows how you can combine funds to mimic the composition of the U.S. stock market.

Investors who want to invest in a Total Stock Market Index Fund often face a situation where they have to approximate it with the funds available in their employer sponsored plans, perhaps also using funds in other accounts, for example a [[Roth IRA]].

This page shows some examples of how to approximate a Total Stock Market Index Fund with funds that cover specific parts of the market.

==Total stock market index==
This table shows Total Stock Market Index Funds from four different providers. The aim is to approximate these Morningstar [[#Stock market classifications| style boxes]] using available funds chosen from the two-fund and three-fund tables below.

==Table notes==
For the above tables:

* The style box numbers were computed by [https://lt.morningstar.com/3y3wd9echv/xray/editholdings.aspx Morningstar Instant X-Ray] by entering each fund ticker as a holding, and entering the dollar value based on the percentage; for example, for VFIAX at 81% and VEXAX at 19%, enter $81 and $19 respectively and observe the computed Morningstar Style Box on the Instant X-Ray tab. Enter different dollar amounts (always adding up to $100) in a trial and error fashion until you replicate the same computation as Total Stock Market, or as close as you can get. You need a free (or paid) subscription to Morningstar to access Instant Xray.
* Computation used the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_squares method of least squares]
* If you are thinking of using an S&amp;P MidCap 400 fund, for example, you might consider the example above that uses IJH. However, there may be slight implementation differences between the S&amp;P MidCap 400 fund you have access to and IJH.
* Two funds may appear to track the same portion of the market (say, mid-cap), but their holdings may differ depending on the indexes they track.

==Stock market classifications==

===Style box format===

Style boxes use the following format. Numbers shown are percentages. Because values are rounded, the percentages may not total exactly 100%.

{{MStarStylebox| LV | LB | LG | MV | MB | MG | SV | SB | SG}}

===Size===

Stocks may be classified by the size of the corporation. This is most commonly done by market capitalization. [[Market capitalization]] is simply a measurement found by taking a stock's current share price and multiplying it by the number of stock shares outstanding.

Exact market cap ranges will vary among different financial and rating institutions, but there are three different terms commonly used to describe stocks by their general size. 

*'''Large cap stocks''' have a market cap over $10&amp;nbsp;billion.
*'''Mid cap stocks''' have a market cap between $2&amp;nbsp;billion and $10&amp;nbsp;billion.
*'''Small cap stocks''' have a market cap between $300&amp;nbsp;million and $2&amp;nbsp;billion.

The Morningstar style box uses percentages rather than fixed dollar thresholds for size classification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://news.morningstar.com/pdfs/FactSheet_StyleBox_Final.pdf| title=Fact sheet: The new Morningstar style box methodology| publisher=Morningstar| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220822012855/http://news.morningstar.com/pdfs/FactSheet_StyleBox_Final.pdf| archive-date=August 22, 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Style===

Stocks may also be classified by "style," one of '''Value''', '''Blend''', or '''Growth'''. 
* '''Growth stocks''' are companies that are growing their profits at a very fast rate and are expected to continue to grow at an increasing rate. 
* '''Value stocks''' are stocks that tend to trade at deep discount relative to their intrinsic value (as defined by profits, book value, and so on). 

Investors commonly think of growth stocks as "high flying companies" and value stocks as "distressed companies." Both growth and value stocks have taken turns leading and lagging one another during different markets and economic conditions.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;You can see the alternating performance of the growth and value stocks on the [[Callan periodic table of investment returns]], which visualizes performance of different asset classes.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Zero coupon bonds''' are [[Bond basics|bonds]] that do not pay interest during the life of the bonds. Instead, investors buy zero coupon bonds at a deep discount from their face value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/investing-basics/glossary/zero-coupon-bond| title=Zero Coupon Bond| publisher=Investor.gov| accessdate=September 17, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics of zero coupon bonds==

* Zero-coupon bonds or "zeros" result from the separation of coupons from the body of a security. Consequently, from a single coupon-paying bond, two bonds result: one which pays the coupons but returns no principal at maturity (an annuity), and one which pays no coupons but returns the par value at maturity (a zero-coupon bond).
* Zeroes sell at discounts from face value.
* The difference between the purchase price of the zero and its face value when redeemed is the investor's return.
* Zeroes can be purchased from private brokers and dealers, but not from the Federal Reserve or any government agency.&lt;ref name="STRIPS"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://treasurydirect.gov/marketable-securities/strips/| title=STRIPS — TreasuryDirect| publisher=TreasuryDirect| accessdate=September 17, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Zeros have the unique property of having a [[Bonds: advanced topics#Duration|duration]] equal to their maturity. This has several consequences for investors:
** A bond of a given maturity has much greater exposure to interest rate changes than a coupon-paying bond. For instance, a 30-year bond with a 5% coupon has a duration of just over 15 years; by contrast, a 30-year zero has a duration of 30 years. Therefore, in a deflationary crisis where long-term Treasuries are expected to do well, zero-coupon Treasuries (STRIPS) will be the best performers.
** The duration of a zero, unlike coupon-paying bonds or bond funds (excepting a few target-date bond funds), keeps pace with the reductions in investment horizon as time passes. This property makes zeroes precisely suited for investing to meet a known, fixed future obligation. The lack of availability of inflation-indexed zeroes, however, limits the utility of this property to satisfying only known, fixed, future obligations valued in nominal dollars. It is possible to create a portfolio of individual bonds or of bond funds that approximates this property of zeroes by [[Individual_Bonds_vs_a_Bond_Fund | periodic rebalancing between bonds/funds of different durations]], although such a scheme leaves the investor subject to yield curve shifts. Creating a declining-duration portfolio of TIPS, however, would allow the reasonably certain satisfaction of a future obligation valued in real dollars.

==Treasury STRIPS==

The U.S. Treasury initially opposed stripping of Treasuries into coupon-only bonds (known as annuities) and maturity-only bonds (zeros), because the zero-coupon bonds could be used to exploit a tax loophole. The 1982 Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act closed this loophole, however, and the same year several private firms were able to create unsanctioned versions on the private market. These issues were not interchangeable on the secondary bond market, making them fairly illiquid. A consortium of primary dealers came together and issued interchangeable zeroes known as Treasury Receipts. In 1985, the Treasury eventually created an authorized version known as STRIPS (Separate Trading of Registered Interest and Principal of Securities),&lt;ref name="STRIPS" /&gt; which has replaced the proprietary issues; the program continues to this day. All Treasury issues of 10-year maturity or greater are eligible for stripping. Because STRIPS cannot be purchased directly from the Treasury, purchasers cannot avoid [[Bid/ask spread|bid/ask spread]]s.

===TIPS STRIPS===

The Treasury&lt;ref name="STRIPS" /&gt; does facilitate "stripping" [[Treasury Inflation Protected Securities | TIPS]], but no functioning market for TIPS STRIPS exists. Barclays Capital created a stripped TIPS known as iStrips, but they did not sell well and the product was discontinued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://seekingalpha.com/article/107144-tips-strips-redux| title=Barclays Capital created a stripped TIPS| publisher=Seeking Alpha| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222203849/http://seekingalpha.com/article/107144-tips-strips-redux| archive-date=December 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Zero-coupon corporate bonds==

Zero-coupon corporate bonds are most prevalent in the [[High_Yield_Bonds | high-yield market]], where their lack of coupon payments in the first several years provides liquidity in a key period for bonds used to finance acquisitions, restructuring, or other immediate cash flow needs. Many high-yield zero-coupon bonds have a structure which reflects this time series, and in fact begin making coupon payments after 3-7 years of couponless existence. 

Zero-coupon bonds, when combined with the call option prevalent in most high-yield securities, cannot be used to provide absolutely certain nominal returns at a given date that zeroes are often used to provide, as an increase in the credit rating of the issuer or a decrease in interest rates would prompt the issuer to call the bond prematurely. They also cannot be used to gain greater exposure to interest rate shifts (e.g. to protect against deflationary crises) as one part of a portfolio, because the negative [[Bonds: advanced topics#Convexity | convexity]] exhibited by bonds with call options alters the picture somewhat and in ways not favorable to the investor.

==Zero-coupon municipal bonds==

Municipal zero-coupon bonds exist, including bonds called "municipal multipliers," in which coupon payments are made but re-invested at the bond's yield. These variations are generally in place to avoid legal restrictions on the amount of liability that issuers were allowed to create.

Another variation of a municipal zero-coupon bond is the Convertible Zero Coupon Municipal Bond (varieties include GAINS (Growth and Income Securities): FIGS (Future Income and Growth Securities)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.allbusiness.com/glossaries/zero-coupon-security/4947891-1.html| title=Dictionary of Banking Terms for: zero-coupon security| publisher=allBusiness.com| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190118091916/https://www.allbusiness.com/barrons_dictionary/dictionary-zero-coupon-security-4947891-1.html| archive-date=January 18, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; and STAIRS (stepped tax-exempt appreciation on income realization securities).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalappreciation.asp| title=Capital Appreciation: Meaning, Types and Examples| publisher=Investopedia| accessdate=September 17, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt; These bonds start as zero coupon bonds and then, generally after eight to 15 years, convert to interest-paying bonds. These bonds appeal to retirement investors who like the tax exempt appreciation of the security up to a retirement date, followed by a conversion to a coupon paying security that provides an income stream during retirement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.investinginbonds.com/learnmore.asp?catid=5&amp;subcatid=27&amp;id=148| title=Variations of Zero Coupon Municipal Bonds| publisher=InvestinginBonds.com}}{{dead link}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tax aspects==

Zeroes do not return the accrued interest until the bond matures, but the IRS taxes the income as it is accumulates each year. Therefore, zeroes are best held in tax-advantaged accounts to escape this taxation on "phantom income." STRIPS, as issues of the Treasury, are exempt from state and local taxation. Zero-coupon bonds issued by municipalities may be exempt from Federal taxation as well.

==Zero-coupon bond funds==

As of 2025, American Century offers a target dated zero-coupon bond fund, set to mature and liquidate by a fixed maturity target date. Although it is convenient to purchase as a mutual fund, carefully compare the 0.57% [[Expense ratios | expense ratio]] (which is paid every year) to the commission and [[Bid/ask spread|bid/ask spread]] of purchasing a zero-coupon bond directly. In many cases (particularly long-dated bonds where you are planning to hold to maturity), purchasing the bond directly will likely cost less.

*[https://www.americancentury.com/funds/fund_facts.jsp?fund=968 American Century Zero Coupon 2025 (BTTRX)], expense ratio (0.57%) 

Vanguard offers an index fund, the [{{Vf | vedtx}} Extended Duration Treasury Index Fund], based on the Bloomberg U.S. Treasury STRIPS 20–30 Year Equal Par Bond Index. Unlike the American Century funds, this fund has no set maturity date, as the maturity is meant to remain at around 25 years. The fund is only available in institutional and ETF shares.

A '''stock''' share (also known as an equity share) represents ownership in a corporation.

The two familiar types of stock shares are "common stock" and "[[preferred stock]]." Owners of common stock typically have voting rights to elect board members of the corporation. In some cases, such as Ford Motors, there are two (or more) types of common stock. One class has the right to vote and the other does not. The Ford family created this dual-share class in such a way that they were able to maintain control of the company without being fully exposed to its risk as an actual majority shareholder.

Preferred stock typically has no voting rights but is legally entitled to dividends before other shareholders. Holding common stock in a corporation allows a shareholder the right to receive dividends from the company, and gives the shareholder a right to the company's assets during bankruptcy liquidation, though not before all creditors have been paid first. Holding stock may result in capital appreciation, as the demand for the stock goes up as the company grows its profits.

For a very basic introduction to stocks, start with the [[#Tutorial | tutorial]] at the bottom of this page.

==Buying and selling==

You can purchase individual stock through either direct investment with the company (through a dividend reinvestment plan, for example), or through a brokerage account. Buying and selling through a brokerage account usually involves a commission paid to the broker. Many discount brokerages offer commissions under $20, and some even offer free commissions for certain situations. Full service brokerages can charge anywhere from $50 to $200 a trade depending on their rates, the number of shares purchased, and how often you trade a stock.

When you place an [[Orders | order]] to buy or sell stock, you might not think about where or how your broker will execute the trade. But where and how your [[Orders | order]] is executed can impact the overall costs of the transaction, including the price you pay for the stock.&lt;ref name=SEC"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/tradexec.htm| title=Trade Execution| publisher=SEC| date=January 16, 2013| accessdate=August 13, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
While trade execution is usually seamless and quick, it does take time. And prices can change quickly, especially in fast-moving markets. Because price quotes are only for a specific number of shares, investors may not always receive the quoted price. By the time your order reaches the market, the price of the stock could be slightly – or very – different. No SEC regulations require a trade to be executed within a set period of time.

Just as you have a choice of brokers, your broker generally has a choice of markets to execute your trade such as: a specific stock exchange, a regional exchange, or a market maker.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;A "market maker" is a firm that stands ready to buy and sell a particular stock on a regular and continuous basis at a publicly quoted price. For more, see: [http://www.sec.gov/answers/mktmaker.htm Market Maker], from Investor.gov.&lt;/ref&gt; When deciding how to execute orders, your broker has a duty to seek the best execution that is reasonably available for its customers' orders.

==Classification of common stocks==

===Country===
One classification of stocks is the country where the corporation is headquartered. Knowing where a stock trades is important because international investments can provide a diversification benefit to a portfolio invested solely in the domestic market.

All else being equal, you should see a diversification benefit from investing internationally because the equity markets in other economies are less-than-perfectly correlated with your own domestic equity market. However, investing in foreign markets also exposes you to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. In the long term, currency movements should have no impact on the returns of a foreign portfolio, but in the short term these fluctuations can significantly impact both your portfolio volatility and your returns.

Stocks trade on stock exchanges all over the world, and trading stocks on an exchange in a different country from your own usually results in higher costs to buy and sell. This expense is greater if the company is located in a smaller or more underdeveloped country where the stock may not get traded frequently, resulting in even higher transaction costs.

In the U.S., an American Depository Receipt (more commonly known as ADR) is a type of stock traded on U.S. exchanges that represents ownership of a non-U.S. corporation. ADRs allow U.S. investors the ability to more easily and cheaply buy stock in corporations from many countries.

A representative global index such as the [[S&amp;P Global Broad Market Index]] illustrates the breakdown of the global equity market by country.

===Sector===
Stocks may also be classified by the sector of business or industry where the corporation makes its revenue and profits. MSCI and S&amp;P have created the widely used [https://www.msci.com/gics GICS global system of business sectors]. This divides companies into four levels: 11 sectors, 24 industry groups, 69 industries, and 158 sub-industries. The eleven sectors are:

===Size===
Stocks may be classified by the size of the corporation. This is most commonly done by [[market capitalization]]. This is simply a value calculated by taking a stock's current share price and multiplying it by the number of stock shares outstanding.

Exact market cap ranges will vary among different financial and rating institutions, but there are three different terms commonly used to describe stocks by their general size:

*'''Large capitalization stocks''': Large cap stocks have a market cap over $10 billion dollars.
*'''Mid capitalization stocks''': Mid cap stocks have a market cap between $2 billion and $10 billion dollars.
*'''Small capitalization stocks''': Small cap stocks have a market cap between $300 million and $2 billion dollars.

While these are the most common market cap references, there are also some less commonly used: mega cap, micro cap, and nano cap. Market cap terms are relative and change constantly as companies get bigger and smaller.

===Style===

Stocks may also be classified by "style," either value, blend, or growth. Growth stocks are companies that are growing their profits at a very fast rate and are expected to continue to grow at an increasing rate. Value stocks are stocks that tend to trade at a deep discount relative to their intrinsic value (as defined by profits, book value, and so on). Investors commonly perceive growth stocks as "high flying companies" and value stocks as "distressed companies."

Both growth and value stocks have taken turns leading and lagging one another during different markets and economic conditions.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The [[Callan periodic table of investment returns]] that visualises the performance of the different asset classes. In it, you can see the alternating performance of the growth and value stocks.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Risks==
[[File:Stock market risk.gif|thumb|right|Figure 1. Risk vs. return&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.duke.edu/~charvey/Classes/ba350/history/history.htm| title=Historical Behavior of Asset Returns| publisher=Duke University| accessdate=August 13, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Stocks are subject to the following risks: 
*'''Business risk''' -- A measure of risk associated with a particular security. It is also known as unsystematic risk and refers to the risk associated with a specific issuer of a security. A common way to avoid unsystematic risk is to diversify - that is, to buy mutual funds, which hold the securities of many different companies.
*'''Financial risk''' -- Risk due to the capital structure of a firm. Corporate debt magnifies financial risk.
*'''Liquidity risk''' -- The risk that an asset cannot be sold when desired due to a thin market.
*'''Market risk''' -- Systematic risk faced by all equity investors due to market volatility. This risk can not be diversified away. This is the type of risk most people are referring to when they casually use the term "risk" with respect to investments, without qualification.
*'''Political risk''' -- Risk to an investment due to changes in the law or political regime. Potential changes in tax law or changes in a country's structure of governance are sources of political risk.

In addition to these risks, international stocks are subject to currency risk.

As Figure 1 illustrates, these risks result in considerable volatility of returns.
&lt;br style="clear: both" /&gt;

==Role in a portfolio==
{{Main|Asset allocation}}
An investment in stocks gives you an ownership stake in the profitability of corporate business enterprise. By receiving the dividends and potential long term appreciation of equity value, you participate in the growth potential of capitalism. A diversified portfolio of stocks, invested for the long term, can provide a portfolio with an asset that has the potential to grow over time.

===Style boxes===
Style boxes are based on the [[Fama and French three-factor model#Categorizing portfolios | Fama and French three-factor model]]. They are 3&amp;nbsp;x&amp;nbsp;3 grids that categorize securities. Different investment styles have various levels of risk which leads to differences in returns. This visualization allows investors to compare securities using an easy-to-understand standardized format.
 
For equities (stocks and stock funds), securities are classified by [[Market capitalization | market capitalization]] ("market cap") on the vertical axis, and value and growth factors on the horizontal axis.

Morningstar introduced the Style Box&amp;trade; in 1992 to help investors determine the investment style of a fund.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://news.morningstar.com/pdfs/FactSheet_StyleBox_Final.pdf| title=Fact Sheet: The New Morningstar Style Box&amp;trade; Methodology| publisher=Morningstar| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220822012855/http://news.morningstar.com/pdfs/FactSheet_StyleBox_Final.pdf| archive-date=August 22, 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other fund providers, such as Vanguard, also use style boxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://personal.vanguard.com/us/FundsStyleBox| title=Vanguard Funds by Style Box| publisher=Vanguard| accessdate=August 13, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Do not compare Vanguard's style box to Morningstar, as they have very different criteria for box style composition. See {{Forum link| t=68058| title=9-style box - Vanguard vs M*}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Equity style boxes (stock funds) and [[Bond basics#Style boxes | fixed income style boxes]] (bond funds) represent two-dimensional (horizontal and vertical axis) views of risk versus return. However, the background behind these boxes is based on very different concepts. '''Only compare stocks-to-stocks and bonds-to-bonds.'''

Both equity and fixed income style boxes are a way to visualize how diversified your portfolio is with respect to the main characteristic of each asset class - size and value for equities; [[Bond basics#Credit risk | credit risk]] and [[Bond basics#Interest rate risk| term risk]] for fixed income.&lt;ref&gt;{{Forum link| p=757434| title=Style boxes - Why the differences? Some questions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, you are interested in [https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/tools/stylebox?View=Fund&amp;Cat=Domestic_Balanced_Balanced Vanguard's balanced funds], which contain both stock and bond funds. The style boxes show you a simple collection of colored boxes, and this can make asset allocation decisions easier.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' looks at how you might split your equity allocation between US and ex-US stocks.

According to Vanguard's [{{Vf | vtwax}} Total World Stock Index Fund], a market-capitalization-weighted index designed to measure the market performance of large-, mid-, and small-capitalization stocks of companies located around the world, as of mid-2023 around 40% of the world's stock investment opportunities, as measured by [[Market Capitalization | market capitalization]], are outside the United States.

== Domestic/international allocation ==

It makes sense to consider diversifying your portfolio by taking advantage of the large asset class of international stocks. Focusing solely on the U.S. means you could be missing many attractive investment opportunities.

Also, according to [[wikipedia:Modern portfolio theory|Modern portfolio theory]]:
{{blockquote|Systematic risk (a.k.a. portfolio risk or market risk) refers to the risk common to all securities—except for selling short ..., systematic risk cannot be diversified away (within one market). Within the market portfolio, asset specific risk will be diversified away to the extent possible. Systematic risk is therefore equated with the risk (standard deviation) of the market portfolio.}}
One consequence of this is that the market portfolio is a starting point for most portfolios, and you need to take any specific risk toward tilting to a home country with care, and make any choice to tilt a conscious one.

Consider that [http://individual.troweprice.com/public/Retail/Mutual-Funds/International-Funds/International-Investing-Explained?WTARank=13&amp;WTARankPhrase=benefits%20of%20international%20stocks in international markets you will find]...
* seven of the ten largest automobile companies
* seven of the ten largest diversified telecommunications companies
* eight of the ten largest metals and mining companies
* six of the ten largest electronic equipment and instruments companies
* five of the ten largest household durables companies

Despite the potential drawbacks of a perceived higher risk, the impact of currency fluctuations, higher investment costs, and an aversion to short-term underperformance relative to domestic markets, international stock investments give you more diversification than an all-U.S. equity allocation.

[[Image:US-International.png|thumb|Figure 2: Graph of U.S./International allocation 'efficient frontier' (1970-2008)]]
The graph in [[:File:US-International.png|Figure 2]] shows relative investment return and volatility (standard deviation of return) for a U.S. S&amp;P 500 index investment as well as an international EAFE (Europe, Australia, Far East) index investment. The graph shows the years from 1970 -- the first full year of the EAFE index -- to the end of 2008; a 39-year investment period.
During the full period, the S&amp;P 500 index had both a higher return and a lower standard deviation than the EAFE index. However, notice the non-linear curve of the graph. This graph shows what is known as an efficient frontier and shows that adding the diversifying effect of the EAFE portfolio (in 10% increments as denoted by the squares) to an all-U.S. S&amp;P 500 portfolio actually increased return while also decreasing standard deviation. The 'most efficient' point being around a 70% S&amp;P 500/30% EAFE combination. But notice that adding anywhere from  1-40% EAFE resulted in an increased return with either a similar or lower standard deviation. However, it must be noted that this data is limited in time period and entirely backward-looking - it is unknown what the proper mix may be in the future based only on the past.

[[Image:World.png|thumb|left|Figure 5: Graph of S&amp;P 500, EAFE, and MSCI World indexes]]
[[Image:US-International-by-decade.png|thumb|Figure 3: Graph of U.S./International allocation 'efficient frontier' (by decades)]]
Of course, these returns are based on historical numbers for a nearly 40-year period. Looking at [[:File:US-International-by-decade.png|Figure 3]], which shows the efficient frontier by decade, it is obvious that the optimal U.S./International allocation differs depending on the period. However, one thing is clear, and that is that combining both U.S. and International stocks has historically increased your return, decreased your volatility of returns, or both.

[[Image:US-International-Emerging.png|thumb|Figure 4: Graph of U.S./International allocation 'efficient frontier' (including emerging markets)]]
[[:File:US-International-Emerging.png|Figure 4]] is similar to [[:File:US-International.png|Figure 2]]. However, instead of using just the EAFE developed market international index, it combines that with international emerging market figures when they became available from 1988 onward. Figure 4 shows the even greater diversification effect of both developed and emerging markets stocks when added to an all-U.S. stock portfolio.

Another way to visualize the diversification benefits of holding both U.S. and international equities is shown in [[:File:World.png|Figure 5]]. This graph shows the growth of an initial $100,000 investment over the period of 1972 to 2007. The S&amp;P 500 index is representative of United States stocks, while the EAFE (Europe, Australia, and Far East) index is representative of developed international markets. The MSCI World index is comprised of all developed market countries. Their percentage in the index is weighted by their global market-capitalization, and so fluctuates in size as each country increases or decreases its world market presence.

Unlike the previous graphs mentioned, which held a static U.S. to international weighting, the MSCI World index shown in [[:File:World.png|Figure 5]] has fluctuated quite a bit with the U.S. comprising the majority of the index during the early periods, Japan dominating during the 1980s, and Europe gaining an increasing share more recently as the U.S. percentage has declined to about 45%. So while this graph may not be directly comparable to one showing a static U.S. to international allocation, what it does show is that, historically, holding a global-market weighted index has included a diversification benefit in that the investment return was higher than an all U.S. allocation, while its volatility (or standard deviation) was significantly tempered from that of an all international allocation.

The increased number of globally oriented equity funds such as Vanguard's Total World Stock Index Fund may reflect a shift in thinking regarding domestic/international equity allocations. Both because markets tend to move in different cycles and because you want to diversify your currency exposure, the need for both U.S. and international allocations is a common recommendation. With U.S.-based companies now deriving a significant portion of their revenue from overseas, and conversely, international companies making large portions of their sales in the U.S., the idea that you need to treat U.S. and international stocks as distinct assets has been somewhat blurred.

== Main types of international funds ==

Some international funds select stocks from many countries, while others focus on a particular region or country. Still others select investments from countries with similar economic conditions, including the two major distinctive types of either developed markets or emerging markets.

*A developed market exists in a country that is a fully modern industrial nation with a well-established stock market, such as most Western European nations, Canada, Japan, and Australia.
*Emerging markets are nations evolving from an agricultural to an industrial economy or from a government-controlled economy to a free market, such as Argentina, Indonesia, Hungary, and India.

Not surprisingly, the risks are generally higher in the emerging markets, where governments and financial markets may be less certain. On the other hand, emerging markets may offer the potential for faster economic growth as well as market cycles that are less synchronized with the developed markets.

== Risks of international investing ==

'''Currency risk'''. Investments denominated in foreign currencies decline in value for U.S. investors when the U.S. dollar rises in value against those currencies. Conversely, the investments rise in value when the U.S. dollar weakens. There have been prolonged periods when the dollar has weakened against foreign currencies and others when it has strengthened.

'''Country risk'''. Events in a specific country—such as political upheaval, financial troubles, or a natural disaster—can drive down the stock prices of companies in that country. You can reduce but not eliminate this risk by choosing an international fund that invests in many countries and has a strong focus on developed nations.

'''Liquidity risk'''. Sometimes foreign stocks can be difficult to buy or sell, in part because trading volume on foreign stock exchanges tends to be much lower than on U.S. exchanges. Liquidity risk means the fund manager may have trouble buying or selling stocks without causing their prices to rise or fall substantially. You can reduce this risk by focusing on funds that invest in many countries and on those with well-established financial markets.

== Risks of home country investing ==

'''Currency risk'''. Currency risk can cut both ways. While we earn and spend most of our money in home-country currency, we also have many assets in that currency not accounted for within investing portfolios - future earnings (human capital), homes and other goods - so the need to minimize foreign-currency exposure may not be as great as it first appears from a portfolio-only perspective.

Consider two common cases: a young investor who is mostly in stocks is also heavy on human capital in general, while an older investor who has moved toward more (home-country) bonds has less human capital but also less equity exposure in general. In either instance, currency risk is mitigated by elements seen and unseen. Thus, many if not most glide paths provide less currency risk upon closer inspection, once an individual's entire financial situation is accounted for.

There is no expected return to currency diversification in itself. However, some degree of zero-expected-return diversification (for example, currencies and commodities) can be beneficial to a portfolio's total risk/return profile. Finally, some people plan to spend money abroad at points in their life, making other-currency holdings potentially advantageous.

'''Country risk'''. Again, this is a risk that cuts both ways. As illustrated in the previous section, country-specific risk is a concern for portfolios. This is not, however, limited to foreign countries. No matter how strong and developed a single market may seem, there are cases (like Japan) in which the market has underperformed for decades. In the early 2000s, the United States underperformed the global market for a lengthy period.

'''Liquidity risk'''. In an effectively efficient market, you should presume that liquidity risk is a factor in returns - or to put it another way: the market has priced in such risks and provides expected rewards in return for them. The best way to control equity risk is, in general, not to avoid a subset of equities, but to hold more assets in bonds or cash-like instruments for diversification.

== Suggested allocations ==
Determining an appropriate domestic/international allocation is a subject of much debate. See: [[Three-fund portfolio#Combining domestic and international stocks | Combining domestic and international stocks]].

      <text bytes="18279" sha1="httwr7no224sfzmzkd6e443v0ci3pvh" xml:space="preserve">Emerging market debt has a long history in the international debt markets, going back to the early nineteenth century. Beginning in 1993, contemporary U.S investors have had access to the '''emerging market bond''' sector through the medium of mutual funds. Historically, most emerging market debt was in the form of external sovereign debt, denominated in an external currency (dollar, pound, euro). Today a majority (3/4) of emerging market debt is issued in local currency.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.investinginbondseurope.org/Pages/BondMarketsAndPrices.aspx?folder_id=510 Bond Markets Defined], investinginbondseurope. 
&lt;/ref&gt; Thus investors have access to funds holding bonds in U.S dollars; funds holding bonds in local currencies; and funds that hold both. Emerging market bond mutual funds are actively managed. Recently the ETF marketplace has offered investors indexed portfolios of emerging market bonds.

==Returns and risks==

Prior to the Mexican default in the early 1980's, most sovereign emerging market debt was a product of bank financing. The establishment of so-called "Brady bonds"&lt;ref&gt;Named after the [http://www.emta.org/template.aspx?id=35 Brady Plan], the principles of which were first articulated by U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady in March 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; during the ensuing Mexican debt restructuring transferred emerging market debt to the public bond markets. The data history of emerging market bond investment is therefore brief. Available data begins in 1991 with the creation of the JP Morgan EMBI index,&lt;ref&gt; Refer to [http://lexicon.ft.com/Term?term=EMBI FT Lexicon] for a succinct description of JP Morgan emerging market bond indexes. &lt;/ref&gt; an index of U.S. dollar emerging market bonds. 

As Erb, Harvey, and Visconti&lt;ref&gt; Erb, Claude B.,[[:Campbell R. Harvey | Harvey, Campbell R.]], and Viscanta, Tadas E., [http://faculty.fuqua.duke.edu/~charvey/Research/Working_Papers/W48_Understanding_emerging_market.pdf Understanding Emerging Market Bonds], Oct. 21, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; noted in 1997, emerging market bond returns from 1991-1997 outperformed the performance of the S&amp;P 500 index. They also noted that this short initial return sequence showed high volatility and negative skewness, suggesting that downside risk was high, although not realized in the short term returns data. This insight was proved correct, as the "Asian Contagion" financial crisis in 1998 produced negative returns in 1998. Returns from 2000-2010 have been somewhat less volatile, but the asset class has retained its quality of negative skewness. Erb, Harvey, and Visconti state:
{{blockquote|One difficulty with measuring skewness is that it likely changes through time. Therefore looking at past data may give no indication of future expected skewness. This is the so called “peso problem” in economic theory. Looking at past currency movements, you may see little variation in rates during a managed float regime. However, there is a probability of a devaluation that you cannot detect from looking at past data. This is just the definition of negative skewness.}}

Emerging market bonds are subject to three major risks:
*'''Interest rate risk'''. Most emerging market bond portfolios hold intermediate to long term bonds. Thus the portfolios have high durations and high interest rate risk: bond principal will fluctuate with changes in interest rates.
*'''Currency risk'''. The marketplace is now dominated by local currency bond issues. These bonds bear currency risk, the risk that changes in exchange rates can result in gains or losses.
*'''Sovereign risk'''. The risk that a country will default on its external non-local currency debt. Closely associated with this risk is inflation risk affecting local currency bonds, where a bond's principal value can effectively be destroyed by high inflation.

===Yields===
[[File:Emerging market bond yields.jpg|right|300px]]
In accordance with the high historical risks associated with emerging market bonds, investors have historically demanded high yields as compensation for bearing risk. Yields, of course, fluctuate with economic fundamentals, as well as with investor sentiment. Emerging market bond interest rates are often measured against risk free debt instruments, resulting in what is known as a "yield spread". The adjacent figure shows yield spreads for the period 1993-2010 between the US dollar denominated JP Morgan EMBI Index and comparable US treasury bonds. The figure also traces the level of credit quality within the EMBI index.

===Correlation===
The Vanguard Institutional white paper, ''Global fixed income: Considerations for U.S. investors'', provides correlation data between emerging market bonds and major asset classes for the period between 2002-2010. Over this period, dollar based emerging market debt had higher correlations (between 0.55 and 0.65) with US stocks, developed market stocks, and emerging market stocks, as well as with US bonds; and lower correlations (between 0.30 and 0.45) with hedged and unhedged international bonds. Local currency bonds had lower correlations (0.30) with US stocks, developed market stocks, and emerging market stocks; and higher correlations (between 0.45 and 0.60) with US bonds, hedged international bonds, and unhedged international bonds.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Joseph H. Ph.D., Patterson, Andrew J.; Philips, Christopher B. CFA, and Thomas, Charles J., [https://institutional.vanguard.com/iam/pdf/ICRIFI.pdf Global fixed income: Considerations for U.S. investors], Vanguard Research and Commentary, January 2011, p.11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Erb, Harvey and Visconti note that emerging market bond correlations with other asset classes are subject to shifts, depending on the state of the economy and markets. Thus during the 1998 "Asian Contagion" currency crisis, emerging market bonds were highly correlated with US stocks, emerging market stocks, and high yield bonds, all of which fell in price, and were negatively correlated with US treasuries, which rose in price.&lt;ref&gt;Erb, Claude B.,[[:Campbell R. Harvey | Harvey, Campbell R.]], and Viscanta, Tadas E., [http://faculty.fuqua.duke.edu/~charvey/Research/Working_Papers/W48_Understanding_emerging_market.pdf Understanding Emerging Market Bonds], Oct. 21, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Default risk===
Bond defaults and restructurings have a long history. Prior to the nineteenth century, defaults were common among European nation states. With national independence movements beginning in the early nineteenth century and continuing to this day, bond defaults and restructurings became prevalent among these new "emerging markets."

Defaults and restructurings tend to occur in clusters. Historical clusters include:&lt;ref&gt;[http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/chapters/0262195534chapm1.pdf Sovereign Defaults and Debt Restructurings:Historical Overview], Chapter 1, p 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Arguments for holding emerging market bond funds==
In the Vanguard Institutional white paper, ''Global fixed income: Considerations for U.S. investors'', conditional recommendation for the emerging market bond asset class is enlisted in two main instances:
#'''Investors seeking total market international bond exposure'''. The Bloomberg Aggregate Global Bond Indexes do not include emerging market bonds.
#'''Potential for added diversification'''. The return properties of emerging market bonds: higher expected returns, higher volatility, and expected low correlations to other asset classes, may appeal to certain investors who wish to include it as a portion of a broadly diversified international bond investment. 

==Arguments against holding emerging market bond funds==
[[:Larry Swedroe]] et al., in their book, ''The Only Guide You'll Ever Need for the Right Financial Plan: Managing Your Wealth, Risk, and Investments''&lt;ref&gt;[[Special:BookSources/1576603660|The Only Guide You'll Ever Need for the Right Financial Plan: Managing Your Wealth, Risk, and Investments]]&lt;/ref&gt; argue against including emerging market bonds in investment portfolios. The authors cite the higher default risk and extreme volatility associated with emerging market bonds as negative features of this asset. They make the following clarifying arguments about the negative features:

*They are illiquid.&lt;ref&gt;A security that cannot easily be sold or exchanged for cash without a substantial loss in value. [http://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/illiquid.asp illiquid], from Investopedia&lt;/ref&gt;
*There is the potential for large losses. They exhibit negative [[:skewness]] and high [[:Excess kurtosis|kurtosis]].
*While having low correlation to other asset classes, the correlation of risk to equities tends to turn high at the wrong time: when equities are in distress and investors look to their bond portfolios to provide stability.
*Returns are earned in a tax inefficient manner.
*Implementation costs are high. Mutual funds are needed and they are expensive.&lt;ref&gt;[[Special:BookSources/1576603660|The Only Guide You'll Ever Need for the Right Financial Plan: Managing Your Wealth, Risk, and Investments]], pp.52-53.&lt;/ref&gt;

The authors advise seeking emerging market exposure by investing in emerging market stocks; and state that emerging market bonds should be considered an allocation to the equity asset class (i.e. drawn from the portfolio allocation to equities, and not the portfolio allocation to bonds).&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=1175372#1175372 Is Larry Swedroe saying NOT to own Emerging Markets?] for a discussion regarding ownership of EM stocks.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second edition of ''All About Asset Allocation'' (2010), [[Rick Ferri]] does not include emerging market bonds in his fixed income allocations, citing the high costs (0.50% to over 1.00%) incurred in implementing emerging market bond portfolios.&lt;ref&gt; [[Rick Ferri]], ''[[All About Asset Allocation]]'' (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

In a Bogleheads forum post, Rick Ferri states that having an allocation to international bonds ''might'' provide a diversification benefit, but it may not be worth the extra cost and complexity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Forum post|p=3892907|title=Re: I’m still not a fan of international bond funds|author=Rick Ferri|date=April 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He recommends the following fixed income allocation:

==Index funds and ETFs==
As of 2013, the only indexed mutual fund portfolio of emerging market bonds available to U.S. investors is the Vanguard Emerging Markets Government Bond Index Fund tracking the Bloomberg USD Emerging Markets Government RIC Capped Index. All other available options are ETF portfolios. Five broad market ETFs, all introduced within the past four years, are included in the table below. Three ETF portfolios, the iShares JPMorgan USD Emerging Markets Bond Fund; the PowerShares Emerging Markets Sovereign Debt Portfolio ETF, and the Vanguard Emerging Markets Government Bond ETF invest in U.S dollar denominated securities. The ishares and Powershare funds hold less than 100 bonds; the Vanguard ETF is expected to hold over 500 bonds. Two of the ETFs listed below, Market Vectors Emerging Markets Local Currency Bond ETF and the SPDR Bloomberg Emerging Markets Local Bond ETF, invest in local currency bonds. These two ETFs hold between 100-500 bonds. All five ETFs invest in a wide number of emerging market countries, which is prudent, given the long history of sovereign default risk among emerging market countries. To further diversify against default risk, make sure that portfolios are not concentrated among a small selection of countries.

The ETFs have lower expense ratios than emerging market bond mutual funds or closed end funds, although ETF transaction costs (commissions, spreads, discount/premium) can significantly add to investment costs.

==Active funds and closed end funds==
There are a large assortment of actively managed emerging market bond funds.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://news.morningstar.com/fund-category-returns/emerging-markets-bond/$FOCA$EB.aspx Morningstar] for active emerging market bond funds.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these funds are load funds. No-load funds are available at lower costs with the lowest cost funds registering expense ratios running between 0.88% and 0.99% per annum.

Emerging market bond funds are also available as [[:Closed End Funds | closed-end funds]]. These funds are traded on stock exchanges, often trade at discount or premium to net asset value, often employ leverage, and often use managed distribution policies. Most have higher than average expense ratios.

Active funds add to the risks inherent in emerging market bonds by introducing '''manager risk''', the chance that poor security selection or focus on securities in a particular sector or category will cause the fund to underperform relevant benchmarks or other funds with a similar investment objective.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' are bonds that can be converted into common stock at the option of the bondholder. The conversion provision of a convertible bond grants the bondholder the right to convert the bond into a predetermined number of shares of common stock of the issuer. A convertible bond is, therefore, a bond with an embedded call option to buy the common stock of the issuer.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;An exchangeable security grants the bondholder the right to exchange the bond for the common stock of a firm other than the issuer of the bond. (Ref: Finance: Capital Markets, Financial Management, and Investment Management)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frank J. Fabozzi, Pamela Peterson Drake, ''Finance: Capital Markets, Financial Management, and Investment Management'', ISBN 978-0-470-40735-6, [https://techbus.safaribooksonline.com/book/finance/9780470407356 Safari Books Online], accessed September 10, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first convertible bonds were sold by US railroad companies in the mid nineteenth century. The contemporary convertible bond market is global, with securities being issued in the US, Canada, Europe, Asia Pacific ex Japan, and Japan.&lt;ref name ="Credit Suisse"&gt; [https://publications.credit-suisse.com/index.cfm/publikationen-shop/white-papers/convertible-bonds/  Convertible Bonds, Fundamentals Asset Allocation Solvency], Credit Suisse whitepaper, 2014. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Institutional issuers and purchasers of convertible bonds==
Issuers of convertible bonds often do so in order to reduce the interest coupon payable upon the bond issue, or to delay dilution of stock equity holders.&lt;ref&gt;[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wonders-convertible-bonds-160000020.html The Wonders Of Convertible Bonds] &lt;/ref&gt; The option of stock conversion is a value that investors pay a premium for, so the bond issuer can demand a higher price for the bond, which results in a lower interest coupon on the bond.

Historically, major large financial institutions such as insurance companies, banks, and hedge funds have been major participants in the convertible bond market. Insurance companies have purchased convertibles to gain stock market exposure from bond portfolios; banks have issued convertible bonds to meet regulatory capital requirements, and hedge funds have specialized in convertible bond arbitrage strategies. However, many arbitrage hedge funds closed due to heavy losses in 2007 and 2008,&lt;ref&gt; [https://online.wsj.com/article/SB122688700899932417.html Convertible-Bond Arbitrage Loses Its Shirt], WSJ, November 17, 2008 &lt;/ref&gt; and in June 2011 bank regulators  placed restrictions on the use of some types of convertible bonds used to meet capital requirements by very large, systemically important banks.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-07-19/basel-regulators-force-banks-to-cut-contingent-convertible-plans.html Basel Regulators Force Banks to Cut Plans for Contingent Convertible Bonds], Bloomberg, July 19, 2011 &lt;/ref&gt;

==Convertible bond fundamentals==

Convertible bonds possess a number of complex features. The specific terms of a bond's maturity, coupon, and conversion options can be different for each bond and are detailed in the bond indenture,&lt;ref group="note"&gt; An indenture is "a contract between an issuer of bonds and the bondholder stating the time period before repayment, amount of interest paid, if the bond is convertible (and if so, at what price or what ratio), if the bond is callable and the amount of money that is to be repaid." [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/indenture.asp Indenture], investopedia definition. &lt;/ref&gt; that entitles the investor to convert the bonds into a predetermined number of stock shares.&lt;ref name ="Credit Suisse" /&gt; 

Valuing a convertible bond can be complex due to the hybrid nature of the instrument, as it contains both fixed income and stock market factors. Professional institutional investors tend to use the mathematics of options (colloquially known as "the Greeks")&lt;ref group="note"&gt; See [[Wikipedia:Greeks (finance)|Greeks (finance)]] for a listing of the mathematical functions used in valuing options.&lt;/ref&gt; to model the non-linear interplay of these factors. 

The basic elements in valuing a convertible bond are graphically illustrated in Figure 1. The graph models bond valuation (the base price); the stock conversion value (conversion price x number of shares), and the premium for the conversion option. 

===Base price===
[[File:Convertiblebondconversion.gif|thumb|right| 390px| Figure 1: Convertible Bonds&lt;ref group="note"&gt; The graph is based on the following inputs. &lt;br&gt; ''Assume that a new issue convertible has come to market. It has a 5 percent coupon and 10 years to maturity. The issuing company has other 10 year debt that carries an 8 percent yield, and the company's stock is currently trading at $42.'' &lt;br&gt; ''The bond indenture specifies a conversion price of $50. Since we know that the conversion price is the effective price for conversion into stock with the bond at par, we divide the par value of the bond ($1,000) by $50, resulting in a conversion ratio of 20 shares. To calculate the current conversion value, we know that the stock price is currently $42. Multiplying $42 by 20 shares, we get a current conversion value of $840. If the issue is sold at par, then the conversion premium would be 19 percent ([$1,000 - 840]/840). The investment value of the convertible at issuance would be the security with the 5 percent coupon discounted at a yield to maturity of 8 percent. The result, according to standard bond calculations, is 79.87, or a dollar value of $798.70. The investment premium would be 25.20 percent ([$1,000 - 798]/798).''&lt;br&gt;-- from [https://www.calamos.com/en/FundInvestor/EducationPlanning/PublishedBookExcerpts/CvtSec-Example.aspx Calamos Investments - Convertible Bond Example]

A convertible bond's maturity and fixed interest rate (along with other bond qualifications) are laid out in the bond's indenture.  Assuming the underlying stock price of a convertible bond fails to reach the conversion price, and the bond does not default, an investor will receive, at maturity, the defined bond interest and principal repayment. In the graph, the base price is represented by the horizontal yield to maturity investment value line.

===Conversion price===
The conversion price is established by the bond's indenture. The issuer will declare the number of stock shares (known as the conversion ratio) to be received upon conversion. For example, if the bond is issued at a $1,000 price and is convertible into 20 shares of common stock, the conversion price for the shares will be $50 per share (price divided by convertible shares).

===Conversion premium===
The conversion premium is calculated as follows:

:Conversion Premium = Bond Price - (Stock Price x Conversion Ratio)

Thus, if a bond, with a conversion ratio of 20, was issued at a $1,000 price and the common stock is selling for $42, the conversion  premium would be determined as:

:$160 = $1,000 - $840 = $1,000 - ($42 x 20)

If the issue is sold at par, then the conversion premium would be 19 percent ([$1,000 - 840]/840).

When the value of a convertible bond's underlying stock is far below the price of the bond, the convertible bond will usually behave more like a conventional bond. [[Bonds: advanced topics#Yield to maturity| Yield to maturity]] and conversion premiums will generally be high.  As the value of the underlying stock moves toward parity with the bond price, the convertible bond will become more sensitive to movements in the stock price, and generally provide lower yields to maturity and lower conversion premiums.&lt;ref name="Invesco"&gt; [https://invescopowershares.com/pdf/P-CVRT-WP-1-E.pdf P-CVRT-WP-1-E. Convertible Bond Primer], Invesco Powershares &lt;/ref&gt; Over longer holding periods, convertible bonds have typically realized higher correlations with stock market returns than with bond market returns.

==Risks==

Convertible bonds are subject to the following risks.

* '''Credit risk''': Convertible bonds, like all corporate bonds, are subject to credit risk, the risk that an issuer may default on the debt,&lt;ref group="note"&gt; A Moody's Research report, ''[https://www.moodys.com/sites/products/DefaultResearch/2001200000349053.pdf Default and Recovery Rates of Convertible Bond Issuers: 1970-2000]'', July 2001, provides the following default statistics for US convertible bonds over the 1970 - 2000 period:
* '''Historical loss rates''': The one-year average loss rate for convertible bonds is 1.05%, compared with 0.63% for all non-convertible bonds. "The fact that most convertible bonds are contractually or effectively subordinated seems to underlie this result."
*  '''Recovery rates''': recovering on average $29 per $100 par for defaulted convertible bonds compared with $43 per $100 par for straight bonds. &lt;/ref&gt; or that the bond will be subject to downgraded status due to deteriorating corporate finances and/or deteriorating economic conditions. Many convertible bonds are not investment grade bonds. On a fundamental level, convertible bonds are subordinated debt, meaning that, in default an issuer's conventional bonds must be paid before convertible bonds can be redeemed.
*'''Interest rate risk''': When the value of a convertible bond's underlying stock is far below the price of the bond, the bond will be more subject to price fluctuation caused by changing market interest rates. These changes will be tied to the bond's [[Bonds: advanced topics#Duration |duration]]. Movements in the  bond's value towards the price of conversion is marked by an increasing positive [[Bonds: advanced topics#Convexity |convexity]] in the duration.&lt;ref name="Credit Suisse" /&gt; 
*'''Equity risk''': As the convertible bond moves towards or surpasses conversion parity, the bond becomes more influenced by the movement of the underlying stock price, usually with an increase in volatility. While the interest earned by convertible bonds helps cushion downside risk, convertible bonds can experience considerable declines in market value, as shown in the market performance of US convertible bonds during bear markets in stocks:&lt;ref name="Invesco"/&gt;

*'''Call risk''': Convertible bonds are frequently issued with call provisions which give the issuing company the right to redeem the bonds prior to the scheduled maturity date. Called bonds can experience shifting duration, convexity, and yield to maturity depending on interest rate movements. In addition to call provisions, some convertible bonds stipulate a mandatory conversion.&lt;ref&gt; [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mandatoryconvertible.asp Mandatory Convertible], definition, investopedia &lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Sector concentration risk''': Convertible bonds tend to be retired at higher rates than conventional bonds of the same maturity due to maturation, being called, or being converted to stock. The resulting higher turnover can result in rapid changes in the convertible bond market. If newly issued convertibles are offered in just a few economic sectors, the concentration can result in increased volatility.&lt;ref&gt; [https://www.vanguard.com/pub/Pdf/sai1690.pdf Vanguard prospectus], Statement of Additional Information, p. B-6.  &lt;/ref&gt;

==Convertible bond indexes==
Suites of convertible bond [[Indexing|indexes]] are available from the following index providers: 

* '''Bloomberg Convertibles''': Bloomberg's aggregate index for convertible securities is the Bloomberg US Convertible Liquid Bond Index, which includes all four major classes of USD equity-linked securities including: convertible cash coupon bonds, zero-coupon bonds, preferred convertibles with fixed par amounts and mandatory equity-linked securities.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/BCS5TRUU:IND Bloomberg U.S. Convertibles Liquid Bond Index]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''EXANE Convertible Securities''': ECI refers to a range of European Convertible Indexes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rimes.com/exane-convertibles EXANE Convertibles |RIMES]{{broken link}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Jefferies Active Convertible Index''' : The core JACI indexes are a normalized price-weighted composition and the flagship index is the JACI Global - a blend of four major regions in pre-specified blending ratios.&lt;ref&gt; [https://www.rimes.com/jefferies-active-convertible-index Jefferies Active Convertible Index | RIMES]{{broken link}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Merrill Lynch Convertible Bond Indexes''': There are three groups of indexes; the first two, the G300 Global Convertible Master Index and the Global Investment Grade Convertible Master Index, concentrate the larger more liquid issues, and tend to be the most appropriate for benchmarking.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rimes.com/merrill-lynch-convertibles Merrill Lynch Convertibles | RIMES]{{broken link}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''UBS Convertible Indexes''': UBS Convertible Indexes measure the size and performance of the convertibles asset class, and are the most widely used convertible bond benchmark internationally.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rimes.com/ubs-convertibles UBS Convertibles | RIMES]{{broken link}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role in a portfolio==
For individual investors, the credit risk and complex features of convertible bonds suggest that professionally managed [[Mutual fund|mutual funds]] are the best vehicles for investing in this asset class.

Advocates for including convertible bonds in the [[Asset allocation|asset allocation]] of a [[Lazy Portfolios|portfolio]] cite these reasons:

* Convertible bonds have low correlation with high grade bonds and cash, and imperfect correlation with equities, which adds to the diversification of a portfolio.
* Convertible bonds often outperform conventional bonds during periods of rising interest rates.
* Convertible bonds at times provide returns that exceed direct stock market returns, with lower volatility than stock market volatility.&lt;ref&gt; See the mutual fund company Invesco's rationale for including convertibles in a portfolio [https://www.invesco.com/pdf/CLCSEC-BRO-1.pdf Convertible Bond Investing]{{broken link}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Larry Swedroe]] and Jared Kizer argue against including convertible bonds in portfolios in  ''The Only Guide to Alternative Investments You'll Ever Need: The Good, the Flawed, the Bad, and the Ugly''. Among the reasons cited&lt;ref&gt; [[Larry Swedroe | Larry E. Swedroe]], Jared Kizer (2008), ''The Only Guide to Alternative Investments You'll Ever Need: The Good, the Flawed, the Bad, and the Ugly'', Chapter 13, ISBN 978-1576603109 &lt;/ref&gt;:

*  A convertible bond's performance shifts from being bond-like to being stock-like. This results in a shifting asset allocation which makes it impossible to accurately determine a fixed stock/bond asset allocation.
* The hybrid bond/stock character of convertible bonds presents an [[Principles of Tax-Efficient Fund Placement|asset location]] dilemma, since equity investments are often best held in taxable accounts, while higher yielding income investments are best held in [[Employer Retirement Plans Overview|tax preferred accounts]].
* If the convertible bond is callable, it is usually called at a time more advantageous to the issuer than to the investor. 

==Exchange traded funds==
State Street offers the SPDR® Barclays Convertible Securities [[ETF]] (CWB), tracking the, Barclays U.S. Convertible Bond &gt; $500MM Index. The fund has an [[Expense ratio|expense ratio]] of 0.40%.&lt;ref&gt; [https://www.spdrs.com/product/fund.seam?ticker=CWB SPDR® Barclays Convertible Securities ETF (CWB)] &lt;/ref&gt;

iShares offers the iShares Convertible Bond [[ETF]] (ICVT) tracking the same index. The fund has an [[Expense ratio|expense ratio]] of 0.20%.&lt;ref&gt; [https://www.ishares.com/us/products/272819/ishares-convertible-bond-etf iShares Convertible Bond ETF (ICVT))] &lt;/ref&gt;

==Mutual funds==
The mutual fund universe contains a large number of convertible bond funds, most of which are [[Mutual Funds and Fees#Sales fees|broker-distributed load funds]]. Morningstar tracks performance of these funds, categorizing them as "convertibles".&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.morningstar.com/fund-category-returns/convertibles/$FOCA$CV.aspx Convertibles],{{broken link}} from Morningstar.&lt;/ref&gt; The average expense ratio for convertible bond funds, as reported by Morningstar, is 1.13% per annum.

Convertible bond funds are also available as [[:Closed End Funds | closed-end funds]]. These funds are traded on stock exchanges, often trade at discount or premium to [[Net asset value|net asset value]], often employ [[Leverage|leverage]], and often use managed distribution policies. Most have higher than average expense ratios.

Active funds add to the risks inherent in investing in bond funds by introducing '''manager risk'''; the chance that poor security selection or focus on securities in a particular sector or category will cause the fund to underperform relevant benchmarks or other funds with a similar investment objective.

In addition, active convertible bond funds usually contain additional securities other than convertible bonds such as convertible preferred stock. They may also hold  a shifting mix of US and international convertible securities.

      <text bytes="12327" sha1="95dkba75vzd22jv1pticaj08pzehuv1" xml:space="preserve">'''{{PAGENAMEBASE}}''' discusses topics that are intended for experienced investors.

==Pricing a bond==
Bond prices are influenced by the credit quality of the issuer as well as marketplace changes in required yield. There is a third factor- the price change of the bond itself over time. Please refer to the [[Bond pricing | bond pricing]] article for details. [[Bond pricing | Bond pricing]] also discusses:
*Basics of the Price/Yield curve
*Selling at discount or premium
*Dirty and clean prices

More in depth discussions can be found at [http://www.investopedia.com/university/advancedbond/advancedbond2.asp investopedia] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_valuation Wikipedia].

==Yield to maturity==
The '''yield to maturity''' of a bond is the interest rate that would be required on an investment of the current price of the bond in order to receive all future scheduled payment (held to maturity).  This is the yield which is quoted in bond pricing reports, and the average yield of all a bond fund's holdings, minus expenses, is the quoted yield of the bond fund.  When a bond price falls, its yield rises, since you can get the same future payments by investing a lower amount at a higher interest rate. 

For example, consider a bond which has a $10,000 face value and pays $500 annually until maturity, then pays back the $10,000 principal.  If the bond price remains $10,000, the yield to maturity remains 5%.  But if the bond price drops to $9,653 four years before maturity, the yield to maturity rises to 6%, as you could get $500, $500, $500, and $10,500 over the next four years by investing $9,653 at 6% interest.

When a bond is downgraded, its price falls because the future payments are less likely to be made, and its yield rises to compensate.  This is why [[High yield bonds |high yield bonds]] have their high yields.

Calculation of [[Bond yield | bond yield]] can be done with a spreadsheet or calculator. Please refer to the [[Bond yield | bond yield]] article to calculate ''yield to maturity'' for:
*Dirty and clean prices
*Zero coupon bonds
*Settlement dates in-between coupon dates
Also in the [[Bond yield | bond yield]] article:
*Current Yield
*Bond Equivalent Yield (BEY)

==Yield curves==
The '''yield curve''' is a plot of bond yields (usually Treasury yields) against years to maturity.  Usually, the curve has an upward slope; long-term bonds have higher yields than short-term bonds as compensation for the increased interest-rate and inflation risk.  

When the curve is steep, investors receive a large premium for taking the greater interest-rate and inflation risks associated with long-term bonds.  When the curve is flat, long-term bonds and short-term bonds have the same current yields.  Sometimes, the curve may even be inverted, with higher yields on short-term bonds than on long-term bonds; this means that the market expects short-term rates to fall, so that a two-year bond reinvested five times is still expected to earn less in ten years than a ten-year bond.

Yield curve examples:
*[http://www.stockcharts.com/charts/YieldCurve.html Dynamic Yield Curve]- 8 years of the Treasury Yield curve, from [http://www.stockcharts.com/charts/ Stockcharts.com]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=51072 bond fund duration, yield curve], forum discussion&lt;/ref&gt;
**Watch the yield curve change over time.
*[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DGS10 Market Yield on U.S. Treasury Securities at 10-Year Constant Maturity] - Yield curve for 10-year US Treasury Bonds, from the St. Louis Fed.

A more in-depth discussion can be found at [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yield_curve Wikipedia].

==Duration==
Bond prices [[Bond basics#Interest rate risk | fluctuate]] in [[Bond basics#Bonds on the secondary market | response to]] market interest rate changes.  The '''duration''' of a bond, or a bond fund, is a measure of its sensitivity to interest rates.  The duration is '''approximately the amount by which the price of the bond will fall for every 1% rise in interest rates'''. For example, a bond with a duration value of 5 years would be expected to lose 5% of its market value if interest rates rose by 1%.

This is only approximately correct because of convexity (see below).  A bond fund with a ten-year duration is twice as sensitive to interest-rate risk as a bond fund with a five-year duration.  (In practice, the relative risk is somewhat reduced because long-term rates are usually less volatile than short-term rates.)

The '''formal definition of duration''' is the average value of the time to each future payment, weighted by the proportion of the present value of the bond made up by the present value of each future payment.  A [[zero-coupon bond]] is a promise to make a single payment at a future time, so its duration is equal to its maturity--the time until that payment is made.  A conventional bond, or bond portfolio, or bond fund, makes multiple payments; each payment has a present value and a duration as if it were a zero-coupon bond, and the average of all durations is weighted by the present value of the payments divided by the present value of the whole bond.  A bond which pays coupons will always have duration less than its maturity.  High interest rates make the duration much shorter than the maturity, since a greater proportion of the bond's total value comes sooner.  In low interest rate environments, coupon-paying bonds more closely resemble zero-coupon bonds (duration is closer to the maturity), since the present value of the principal returned at maturity is generally much larger than the coupon payments.

Duration has another useful summary property, which is that if the yield curve shifts in parallel&lt;ref group="note"&gt;A parallel shift is when the long-term and short-term rates increase/decrease by the same amount. In other words, the yield curve moves uniformly across the whole range. Imagine you have a 10-year bond, with a yield curve that pays out 5% for bonds &gt;8 years and 4% for bonds &lt;8 years, and 3% for money market rates. Now, all of a sudden the interest rates rise to (6% &gt;8 years, 5% &lt;8 years, 3% money market rate is unchanged). This is a non-parallel shift of the yield curve, since everything didn't go up by the same amount.&lt;/ref&gt;, then duration is the '''point of indifference to interest rate changes'''.  For example, if a bond/portfolio/fund with a duration of 5 years experiences a market interest rate increase of 1%, its value will drop by approximately 5%; however, since the same coupon payment now represents a higher percentage of the bond's value, its yield is higher (it will match the market rate), and the higher yield plus higher market interest on coupon payments compensate for the NAV loss.  Thus duration represents the length of time it would take for the total value of the fund, with dividends reinvested, to be worth exactly what it would have been worth had interest rates not risen.  To be absolutely assured of receiving a given sum on a future date (assuming parallel shifts of the yield curve), therefore, you should gradually reduce the duration as the date approaches.  A zero-coupon bond reduces duration by exactly the amount of time that passes, and is therefore the risk-less choice for meeting a future obligation.  However, few investors have such exact demands on their capital.  For most purposes, shifting from intermediate- or longer-term bonds to shorter-term bonds as the need for capital approaches will cause little risk; also, in practice non-parallel shifts of the yield curve are not likely to cause very large changes in returns.

Bonds and bond funds also compute an '''effective duration''' which takes into account the possibility that the bond will be called (paid back early).  

A graphical tutorial can be found at [http://www.investopedia.com/university/advancedbond/advancedbond5.asp Investopedia's article on bond duration]. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_duration Wikipedia] also has more information.

:''And: The [[Individual_Bonds_vs_a_Bond_Fund#Duration | Duration]] section of [[Individual bonds vs a bond fund]]''

==Convexity==
Duration is just one number, and cannot completely describe the relationship between bond prices and interest rates, as they are not a straight line; a bond which rises in price by 0.5% for a 0.1% fall in interest rates may not rise by 5% for a 1% fall in interest rates.  '''Convexity''' is a description of how the price moves away from the linear relation; a bond with ''positive convexity'' will be worth more than given by the linear relation if interest rates change significantly (in either direction), while a bond with ''negative convexity'' will be worth less.  Effectively, a bond with positive convexity increases in duration when interest rates fall (and thus the price rises more from the rate fall than would be indicated by the duration) and decreases in duration when interest rates rise (and thus the price falls less from the rate rise).  A bond with negative convexity increases in duration when interest rates rise and decreases in duration when interest rates fall.

Simple bonds, with no call or prepayment features, have positive convexity.  If a bond is likely to be called, it has negative convexity, because the issuer will redeem it at the call price if interest rates have fallen enough to make it worth more than that price.  Callable [[High yield bonds |high yield bonds]] often have considerable negative convexity; if the bonds improve to investment grade, the interest rates will fall considerably but the issuer will call them and investors will not get the full benefit of the rate decrease.

[[Mortgage-backed security | Mortgage-backed securities]] have considerable negative convexity because homeowners can refinance their mortgages.  If interest rates fall, more homeowners will refinance, and the mortgage-backed securities will pay back the principal on the refinanced loans, which did not rise with the fall in interest rates.  Bondholders can reinvest the returned principal, but they reinvest it at the current (lower) rate and do not benefit from the fall in interest rates.  

Given two bonds with the same duration, credit risk, and yield, the bond with higher convexity will always be worth at least as much and may be worth more.  Therefore, investors demand higher yields for bonds with negative convexity; this is why yields on GNMA mortgage-backed securities are higher than on Treasury bonds  even though GNMAs are also backed by the full faith and credit of the US government.  Vanguard even warns about this risk when it quotes the yield on the [{{Vf | 0036}} Vanguard GNMA Fund].

[http://www.investopedia.com/university/advancedbond/advancedbond6.asp Investopedia's article on bond convexity] gives a more complete illustration, as does [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_convexity wikipedia].

'''Corporate bonds''' are bonds issued by corporations of sufficient credit quality to be considered investment-grade (i.e. excludes [[High yield bonds | High Yield/"Junk" bonds]]).

==Risks==

===Interest rate risk===
The most common model for thinking about corporate bonds is that they pay a premium on top of the risk-free rate (represented by ultra-short-term default-risk-free assets like Treasury Bills) for assuming other risks.  One of those risks is shared with Treasuries of similar duration: [[Bond basics#Interest rate risk | interest rate risk]].

===Credit risk===
Although legally bondholders must be paid before stockholders, there is nevertheless the risk that a company could default on its loans, triggering bankruptcy proceedings.  This risk varies with the [[Bond basics#Credit risk | credit rating of the bond]].

===Call risk===
Many corporate bonds include [[Bond basics#Call risk | call options]] which allow the issuer to buy back the bond at face value under certain conditions.  This is most likely to occur if market rates fall or if the issuer's credit rating improves substantially, limiting the extent to which the investor can profit from these otherwise favorable occurrences. This [[Bonds: advanced topics#Convexity | negative convexity]] is generally far smaller than the negative convexity experienced by [[Mortgage-backed security | mortgage-backed bonds]].

==Corporate bond types==

Corporate bonds are often broadly classified into 5 groups:&lt;ref&gt;Thau, Annette (2012). The Bond Book. The McGraw Hill Companies. pp. 173.&lt;/ref&gt;

# ''Utilities:'' Bonds issued by companies which provide a public utility such as power or water.
# ''Transportation:'' Bonds issued by companies such as railroads and airlines.  
# ''Industrials:'' This is the group where companies which do not fit cleanly into the other 5 groups are categorized and is therefore the largest and most diverse group.  It includes bonds ranging from those issued by GE to IBM.
# ''Finance:'' Bonds issued by companies such as banks and insurance companies.  
# ''Yankee Bonds:'' Bonds issued by foreign companies which are denominated in US Dollars. Foreign companies issue Yankee bonds in order to attract US buyers.

==Taxation==

Interest and capital gains from corporate bonds are taxable at both the state and federal level.  This is in contrast to treasury bonds, which are taxable at the federal but not state level, and municipal bonds which can often be exempt from both state and federal taxes.  Investors should therefore take their individual tax situation into account when evaluating corporate bonds vs. other types of bonds.

==Corporate bond prices==

Brokers are required to report their corporate bond trades to FINRA within 15 minutes of the trade.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.finra.org/Industry/Compliance/MarketTransparency/TRACE/FAQ/P125244 Reporting of Corporate and Agencies Debt Frequently Asked Questions], FINRA &lt;/ref&gt;  TRACE  (Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine) is  FINRA’s system for collecting and distributing bond price data. Access to TRACE is freely available to individual investors and can be found [http://finra-markets.morningstar.com/BondCenter/TRACEMarketAggregateStats.jsp here] (enable browser cookies to view).  Many online brokers now offer real time electronic access to executable bond prices as well.  

==Role in a portfolio==

According to Boglehead and financial guru Larry Swedroe, "the evidence shows that corporate bonds have provided very similar returns to Treasuries (credit risk has not been rewarded appropriately)." &lt;ref&gt; Source: [http://moneywatch.bnet.com/investing/blog/irrational-investor/bonds-or-bond-funds-an-easy-choice/873/?tag=col1;blog-river first comment of Alan Roth's article] &lt;/ref&gt;.  Swensen also argues for only including Treasuries in a portfolio.

Other experts, including the authors of the Bogleheads' guides, routinely recommend Vanguard's Total Bond Market fund, which includes a hefty portion of investment-grade corporate bonds.  In a September 2012 interview&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.indexuniverse.com/sections/interviews/14500-bogle-buy-corporate-bonds-with-rates-low.html Bogle: Buy Corporate Bonds With Rates Low], indexuniverse.com &lt;/ref&gt; John Bogle also commented on the attractiveness of corporate bonds at that time.  

As with many situations, there is probably no right answer to the question of whether or not to include corporate bonds in your allocation.  Including them is certainly a perfectly reasonable thing to do, and can add higher yield, albeit at the cost of increased correlation with the equity component of your portfolio.

Unless you have an extremely large portfolio the preferred way to invest in corporate bonds is via a bond fund.  While some investors [[Individual_Bonds_vs_a_Bond_Fund | prefer to hold bonds directly]], for corporate bonds the loss in diversification as compared to a fund makes that choice ill-advised.  A bond fund typically holds thousands of bonds, which diversifies away the un-systematic risk of individual issuers defaulting.  It would be difficult to hold even a tenth as many bonds in all but the largest individual portfolios, leaving bondholders exposed to risk they are not rewarded for taking.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' are bonds issued by states and local governments. There are several types:

*'''General Obligation Bonds''' are municipal bonds secured by the taxing and borrowing power of the municipality issuing it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.investorwords.com/2165/General_Obligation_Bond.html General Obligation Bond definition at ''Investor Words'']&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Revenue Bonds''' are municipal bonds supported by the revenue from a specific project, such as a toll bridge, highway, or local stadium.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/revenuebond.asp Revenue Bond definition at ''Investopedia'']&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Assessment Bonds''' are special types of municipal bonds used to fund a development project. Interest owed to lenders is paid by taxes levied on the community benefiting from the particular bond-funded project.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/specialassessmentbond.asp Assessment Bond definition at ''Investopedia'']&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Build America Bonds''' are municipal bonds issued under a program started in 2008.  Through the BAB program, the Federal government directly subsidizes taxable municipal bonds instead of subsidizing municipal bonds via a tax break for their purchasers.  This opens the market up to a wider range of participants, including tax-exempt institutions and individuals with sufficient tax-exempt space.

==Taxation==
===Interest===
Interest from municipal bonds is generally exempt from federal income tax and the issuing state's income tax.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;States with no income tax do not impose taxes on municipal bonds.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are a few exceptions. 

* Interest from some municipal bonds is subject to [http://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc556.html Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT)] although whether you actually have to pay AMT depends on your individual circumstances.  Such bonds are commonly referred to as AMT bonds.
* Some states charge income tax on interest from their own municipal bonds.

Areas of note:
* '''Puerto Rico, Guam, and US Virgin Islands:''' No state can tax bond interest issued by US territories.&lt;ref name="muni"&gt;[http://www.municipalbonds.com/education/read/113/tax-exemption-from-state-income-taxes Tax-Exemption from State Income Taxes], from [http://www.municipalbonds.com/about/ MunicipalBonds.com]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''New York City:''' Bonds issued in NY may be triple tax-exempt from city, state, and federal income taxes.&lt;ref name="muni" /&gt;
* '''Utah:''' Utah reciprocates taxation. Utah does not tax its own bonds, but also does not tax bonds issued in states that do not tax Utah bonds.&lt;ref name="muni" /&gt;
* '''Washington D.C.:''' Does not tax in-state or out-of-state municipal bonds.&lt;ref name="muni" /&gt;

===Capital gains/losses===

Capital gains and losses are subject to taxation.  One notable point is the treatment of capital losses for a holding period of less than six months.  For an [[ETF]] holding bonds (but not for a traditional mutual fund if the fund accrues dividends daily and pays them at least monthly, as most bond funds do), if you received exempt-interest dividends, at least part of your loss is disallowed. You can deduct only the amount of loss that is more than the exempt-interest dividends. Report the loss as a short-term capital loss. See [http://www.irs.gov/publications/p550/ch04.html#en_US_2024_publink100010561 Publication 550 (2024), Investment Income and Expenses] and [http://www.fairmark.com/mutual/stcl.htm Short-Term Capital Losses] for more details.

{{Notice|''Example''&lt;br&gt; Assume that an investor purchases $10,000 of a tax-exempt bond ETF. Five months after purchase, the net asset value of the fund has dropped and the investor has a $200 short-term loss. Over this five month period, the investor has received $125 dollars of tax-exempt income. The investor must increase the sales price ($9,800) by the the dividends received. The adjusted basis of $9,925 results in a deductible $75 short term loss.}}

===Social Security===
Municipal bond interest is included in modified adjusted gross income to determine how much of a taxpayer's Social Security is taxed. See: [https://www.irs.gov/publications/p915 Publication 915, Social Security and Equivalent Railroad Retirement Benefits]

==Risks==

===Call risk===
Many bonds are issued with provisions which allow the issuer to repay the bond before the bond reaches maturity. This is termed "calling" the bond. Since issuers call bonds when interest rates fall and the the cost of financing the debt is cheaper in the new lower rate environment, a called bond is disadvantageous to the investor, who now must reinvest the returned capital at lower interest rates. An additional risk with a bond with a call feature is the tendency of the bond to have shifting durations as the likelihood of a call rises and falls with the fluctuation of market interest rates. The bond will sometimes be priced to the call date (when interest rates are falling); at other times to the maturity date (when interest rates are rising).&lt;ref&gt;This tendency is known as negative convexity. See [[Bonds: advanced topics#Convexity|Bonds:advanced topics]]&lt;/ref&gt; Bonds with a call feature usually pay a higher interest rate than non-callable bonds as partial compensation for the increased risk.

===Credit risk===

Credit risk is generally much less than that for corporate bonds.  Nonetheless, it exists.(Refer to [http://www.moodys.com/cust/content/content.ashx?source=StaticContent/Free+pages/Credit+Policy+Research/documents/current/2001700000407258.pdf Moody’s US Municipal Bond Rating Scale] for data on defaults). While only 5 corporations have a AAA credit rating, 16 states are rated AAA.  Furthermore over 90% of municipal bonds are rated A or better by Fitch, while the average corporate bond is rated in the B range&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.learnbonds.com/municipal-bond-defaults/ Municipal Bond Defaults: Don’t Believe the Hype], LearnBonds&lt;/ref&gt;.  The default rates reflect those higher ratings.  According to a report by Moody’s&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moodys.com/researchdocumentcontentpage.aspx?docid=PBC_140114 Moody's], registration required.&lt;/ref&gt; which covers the default rates of municipal bonds from 1970 to 2011, the average default rate of rated municipal bonds was .13% during that time.  That compares to an average default rate of 11.17% for rated corporate bonds over that same time period.  

Some municipal bonds are insured by private insurance companies. ([http://www.afgi.org/who-fact.htm AFGI - The Basics]}

Some investors seek to  mitigate the credit risk by diversifying their municipal bonds beyond the state of residence.  The caveat is that they may have to pay state income tax on the interest from out-of-state municipal bonds.

===Liquidity risk===

Municipal bonds are generally illiquid,&lt;ref&gt;A security that cannot easily be sold or exchanged for cash without a substantial loss in value. [http://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/illiquid.asp illiquid], from Investopedia&lt;/ref&gt; especially at the retail level.  To mitigate the risk, you may consider holding them to maturity or holding them through a low-cost mutual fund, which can trade on the wholesale market.

==Meredith Whitney==

In 2010 analyst Meredith Whitney was interviewed on 60 Minutes and predicted that there would be 50 to 100 sizable defaults&lt;ref&gt;http://youtu.be/hI-rIGyLri4{{Dead link}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Whitney came to fame by being one of the first analysts to predict the banking crisis in 2008, so many investors took that statement to heart.  According to a Vanguard article on the topic&lt;ref&gt;https://personal.vanguard.com/us/insights/article/muni-non-crisis-112012{{Dead link}}&lt;/ref&gt;, from November of 2010 to November of 2011 investors withdrew $35 Billion from municipal bond funds.  Unfortunately for those investors her prediction did not come true this time and the municipal bond market rallied over 12% during that time.

==Role in a portfolio==

* If you have filled up your tax-advantaged accounts with tax-inefficient assets (taxable bonds, [[Real estate investment trust | REITs]], [[Commodities | commodities]], etc), and you still need bonds to meet your desired stock/bond asset allocation, you might consider placing municipal bonds (or a mutual fund thereof) in your taxable account.
* If you are in high tax brackets, and you are saving for short-term cash needs (such as car, home down payment, etc), then you might consider short-term municipal bonds or tax-exempt money market funds.  (Note that [https://personal.vanguard.com/ Vanguard]'s tax-exempt money market funds contain AMT bonds.  [https://www.fidelity.com/homeframe_cp.shtml Fidelity] offers some AMT-free tax-exempt money market funds as well as those with AMT bonds in them.)

==Taxable equivalent yield==

[[Taxable equivalent yield]] of a municipal bond is one that a taxable bond would have to pay to deliver the same amount of income as the municipal bond.  The taxable equivalent yield depends on the investor's tax brackets.  The following calculators allow you to calculate the taxable equivalent yield.

*[http://files.thefinancebuff.com/calculators/Bond-Funds-Yield-Calculator.html Boglehead tfb's Bond Fund Yield Calculator]
*[http://screen.morningstar.com/BondCalc/BondCalculator_TaxEquivalent.html Bond Calculator] (login required)

It's important to calculate the taxable equivalent yield before purchasing municipal bonds because taxable bonds with comparable credit ratings may have greater yields.

      <text bytes="10260" sha1="2q28kx47v2ei5pn0tvnv4a47301qn3z" xml:space="preserve">'''{{PAGENAME}}''' brings a [[portfolio]] that has deviated away from its target [[asset allocation]] back into line. The idea is that maintaining a consistent mix of [[asset class]]es (most commonly [[equities]] and [[fixed income]]) will help to keep risk at the desired level.

You do this by transferring funds from higher-performing classes to lower-performing classes. Although this may seem counterintuitive, rebalancing ensures that investors "Buy Low" and "Sell High".

==Example==
* You own two funds (Fund A and Fund B). The funds could be either [[mutual fund]]s, [[index fund]]s or [[exchange-traded fund]]s (ETFs).
* You have a $10,000 portfolio and have selected an asset allocation such that each fund represents 50% of the total ($5,000 each)
* Over time, Fund A rises in value to $6000 while Fund B declines in value to $4,000 - you now have a 60/40 split instead of 50/50
* To maintain your asset allocation, you would rebalance your portfolio by taking $1,000 from Fund A and transferring it to Fund B
* After this, your asset allocation is once again 50/50

==Different rebalancing approaches==
There are several ways you can determine when it is time to rebalance:
* At a certain point in the calendar (for example, the beginning of the year, a specific day of the year, every other year, and so on). For example, you might systematically rebalance your portfolio once a year, on your birthday.
* When asset classes deviate from their target by a specific ''absolute percentage''. For example, if your target asset allocation is 60% equities and 40% fixed income and your (absolute) rebalancing threshold is +/-&amp;nbsp;5%, you would rebalance your portfolio when your portfolio reaches (65% equities / 35% fixed income) or (55% equities / 45% fixed income).&lt;ref group="note" name="5/25"&gt;[[Larry Swedroe]] uses a "5/25 rule" which works like this:
*'''Absolute percentage of 5% for allocations 20% or greater:''' When asset classes deviate from their target by an ''absolute'' percentage of 5%. For example, if your target asset allocation is 60% equities and 40% fixed income, you would rebalance your portfolio when your portfolio reaches (65% equities / 35% fixed income) or (55% equities / 45% fixed income).
*'''Relative percentage of 25% for allocations less than 20%:''' When asset classes deviate from their target by a ''relative'' percentage of 25%. For example, if your target equities asset allocation is 60%, composed of 45% Total Stock Market and 15% Total International, you would rebalance Total International if it changes by more than +/-&amp;nbsp;3.75% (25% of 15%).

* When asset classes deviate from their target by a certain ''relative percentage''. For example, if your target equities asset allocation is 60%, composed of 40% Total Stock Market and 20% Total International, and your (relative) rebalancing threshold is +/-&amp;nbsp;25%, you would rebalance International if it changes by more than +/- 5% (25% of 20%).&lt;ref group="note" name="5/25" /&gt;
* When asset classes deviate from their target by a certain dollar amount. For example, if you hold $6,000 in equities and $4,000 in fixed income and your rebalancing threshold is +/-&amp;nbsp;$1,000, you would rebalance your portfolio when either of your holdings deviates from their target asset allocation of 60% equities / 40% fixed income by at least $1,000.
* When contributing to or withdrawing from your portfolio. For example, if your target allocation is 60% equities and 40% fixed income, you hold $7,000 of equities and $3,000 of fixed income, and you wish to contribute $1,000 to your portfolio, you would simply buy $1,000 worth of fixed income assets. This would bring you to an allocation of 64% equities / 36% fixed income. This approach minimizes transaction costs, effort, and taxes. This [https://optimalrebalancing.info portfolio rebalancing calculator] can help in cases where it is not obvious how much of a new contribution or withdrawal to allocate to each asset.

==Other considerations==
* Think about transaction costs when deciding whether or not to rebalance. Because transactions often have costs associated with them, many investors choose to wait for their portfolio to pass a significant threshold of deviation (whether defined by percentage or dollars) before rebalancing.
* Investors often find it difficult "selling winners" to "buy losers". To help remove emotions from the decision, you might choose a specific date to rebalance (for example, birthday, tax day, and so on). Investors who find the prospect daunting may want to consider [[Vanguard target retirement funds]], which automatically rebalance as necessary to maintain a consistent asset allocation.
* The frequency with which you check your portfolio for deviations from its target has some influence on the returns gains (or losses) that rebalancing generates.&lt;ref group="note" name="frequency"&gt;Research seems to indicate that checking weekly (while actually rebalancing very infrequently, for example by using large deviation thresholds) could provide the best rebalancing bonus. Conversely, rebalancing too frequently and using low thresholds would be detrimental. See: [https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/57f8/766d83249e5be740c6cdacc8b30f8a5277cd.pdf Opportunistic Rebalancing: A New Paradigm For Wealth Managers], Gobind Daryanani.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modified approaches==
If you worry about rebalancing into a sustained bear market, one of these modifications to standard rebalancing methods might be useful:
* Keep a floor level of bonds, that is, once the total amount of bonds has dropped to a fixed amount, stop rebalancing into stocks.
* Only rebalance out of stocks, never into stocks.

==Estimating changes in asset allocation==
Normal market fluctuations do not frequently trigger rebalancing. For example, shifting the balance of a 50/50 portfolio by 1% requires a 4% change in the price of stocks relative to bonds.

All other portfolios are less sensitive, with 70/30 or 30/70 requiring a 5% change, 80/20 or 20/80 a 6% change, and 90/10 or 10/90 an 11% change. For example, a $10,000 60/40 portfolio will, after a 10% stock market drop, have $6,000 * 0.9 = $5,400 in stocks and $4,000 in bonds, for a stock allocation of $5,400 / ($5,400 + $4,000) = 57.45%, a 2.55% shift.

'''Mortgage backed securities''', which include Ginnie Mae Securities (GNMA) and Collateralized Debt Instruments (CDO), are among the most complex fixed income securities. Vanguard provides a basic description of mortgage backed securities in the prospectus to its bond funds:
{{blockquote|
Mortgage-backed securities represent interests in underlying pools of mortgages. Unlike ordinary bonds, which generally pay a fixed rate of interest at regular intervals and then repay principal upon maturity, mortgage-backed securities pass through both interest and principal from underlying mortgages as part of their regular payments. Because the mortgages underlying the securities can be prepaid at any time by homeowners or by corporate borrowers, mortgage-backed securities are subject to [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/prepaymentrisk.asp prepayment risk]. These types of securities are issued by a number of government agencies, including the GNMA, the FHLMC, and the FNMA, [as well as by private issuers].
As a rule, when interest rates rise, bond prices fall. The opposite is also true: Bond prices go up when interest rates fall. Mortgage-backed securities are different. In general, declining interest rates will not lift the prices of mortgage-backed securities—such as GNMAs—as much as the prices of comparable bonds. Why? Because when interest rates fall, the bond market tends to discount the prices of mortgage-backed securities for prepayment risk—the possibility that homeowners will refinance their mortgages at lower rates and cause the bonds to be paid off prior to maturity. In part to compensate for this prepayment possibility, mortgage-backed securities tend to offer higher yields than other bonds of comparable credit quality and maturity.}}

==Risks==
In addition to the [[Bond basics#Risks | normal risks of bonds]], mortgage-backed securities exhibit negative [[Bonds: advanced topics#Convexity|convexity]]. This negative convexity results from [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/contractionrisk.asp contraction risk], when homeowners refinance as interest rates fall, and from [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/extensionrisk.asp extension risk], when homeowners delay pre-payments as interest rates rise.

Determining the exact extent of this negative convexity is impossible, as it depends on how mortgagors behave. In general, this behavior is non-linear: small changes make little difference in homeowner behavior but large changes cause homeowners to overcome inconvenience and refinance in larger numbers. Statistical modeling can approximate the extent of negative convexity, but behavior with large interest rate changes is relatively hard to predict. Bondholders are compensated for this risk by the "option-adjusted spread," which can be interpreted as the market's assessment of the size of prepayment risk. 

== Role in a portfolio ==
While there is some question as to whether the option-adjusted spread has historically been enough to compensate investors for the increased risk of MBSs, the general consensus is that the market prices these securities efficiently. However, in [[Special:BookSources/978-0-312-35363-6|''The Only Guide to a Winning Bond Strategy You'll Ever Need'']], [[Larry Swedroe]] argues that these bonds do not properly diversify the risks of stocks in the portfolio as a whole due to their negative convexity: "In a rising rate environment ... MBS will have increasing correlation with equities, and this is not a good thing."

Other Bogleheads hold large allocations of their portfolio in MBS, either by holding Total Bond Market (since a large portion of that fund is in MBS) or directly through the [[GNMA]] fund. [[John Bogle]] has expressed some skepticism of these bonds, calling them "non-bonds."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://johncbogle.com/wordpress/2007/06/15/john-bogle-responds-to-ask-jack-questions-2/| title=John Bogle responds to “Ask Jack” questions| publisher=The Bogle eBlog| date=June 15, 2007| accessdate=October 3, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Holding MBSs as a part of a diversified bond portfolio is unlikely to lead to ruin, and over time you are likely to be compensated for the increased risk of negative convexity with higher yield. Therefore, it can make sense to invest in MBSs, either directly or through a total bond market fund (which typically are about one-third MBS), provided you understand that you are taking a moderate amount of additional risk. If you do not want the added risk of negative convexity, or you are interested in lowering the correlation between the bond component of your portfolio and the equity component, you would be fine sticking to bonds that lack embedded options.

== Types of mortgage-backed security ==

; Government and quasi-governmental agencies
: [[GNMA]] obligations are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government, just as [[Treasury Bonds | Treasuries]] are. [[Fannie Mae]] and [[Freddie Mac]] are public companies but are assumed to have the backing of the U.S. Government. This was borne out in the 2008 crisis, when the Federal Government did just that. They are therefore considered quasi-governmental agencies.
; Corporate
:Non-government-backed MBSs are a very small part of the market. GNMA, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac hold the bulk of all MBSs.

      <text bytes="22577" sha1="l0vx2jsfzxzou3nw0lbgv6r2htwgh6f" xml:space="preserve">When it comes time to start taking withdrawals from your retirement portfolio, there are several '''withdrawal methods''' you can use.  What is most important to you?  Is it having a constant withdrawal amount?  Do you need the amount adjusted for inflation each year? Is protection of your principal more important, or do you want to spend it all and be flat broke just in time for the grim reaper?  Maybe you want something in-between. Here we will explain some complicated-sounding strategies, such as “constant-dollar” and “constant-percentage.” But don’t worry - it won't be as difficult as it sounds.

==Constant-dollar==
A constant-dollar withdrawal is the most commonly discussed method.   The famous [[Safe withdrawal rates#Trinity Study:|Trinity Study]] considered  what annual rate of retirement withdrawals retirees can sustain. In other words, what is the rate at which the retiree is not likely to run out of money?  

When you apply this method, you take your first yearly withdrawal based on a percentage of your investment portfolio value (Trinity says 4%). In the second year your withdrawal amount will not be based on your portfolio’s value. Instead, you return to the first year withdrawal amount and adjust it upward at the rate of inflation. For the third and each subsequent year, you go back to the previous year’s withdrawal amount and then adjust it upward using the current rate of inflation.

The advantage of this method is that your withdrawals are predictable and constant in “real dollars.”  This means your annual withdrawal amount maintains the same real spending power after inflation.  The disadvantage is if the market starts a prolonged downturn just before or during your first few years of retirement, your assets could be substantially or entirely depleted as you continue to take a larger inflation-adjusted withdrawal each year.

You might prefer this method if you have relatively high fixed expenses, and you want the predictability of a constant 'paycheck.'

|-

|}

==Constant-percentage==
Let’s consider a constant-percentage withdrawal. Do you need to ensure you always have some savings left?  If so, withdraw the same percentage annually based on your current portfolio balance. Because the value of your portfolio will change annually with the ups and downs of the financial markets, keep in mind the dollar amount you withdraw will also fluctuate from year-to-year.

Annual withdrawals are not automatically increased for inflation; instead, this method counts on long-term portfolio growth to take care of inflation.

The advantage of this method is its simplicity -  just multiply your portfolio balance each year by your withdrawal percentage. Your portfolio still might decrease in value, depending on market conditions and the rate of withdrawal you choose, but you will never run out of money. The disadvantage is your withdrawal amounts will always fluctuate with your portfolio’s value. You'll have to spend less in years when your portfolio value drops, and unless portfolio returns are good, you may not have enough in later years to keep up with inflation.
You might prefer this method if you have lower fixed expenses - that is, year-to-year flexibility in spending.

:{| style = "width:500px;"
|+'''Figure 2: Graph of constant-percentage yearly withdrawals and remaining portfolio value.'''
|-
|align = "center"|[[File:Constantpercentage.jpg|450px]]
|}


==Variable-percentage==
You would like to spend more but without fear of running out of money? Have a look at [[Variable percentage withdrawal]] (VPW). This method lets you withdraw an increasing percentage annually based on your current portfolio balance. Because the value of your portfolio will change annually with the ups and downs of the financial markets, keep in mind the dollar amount you withdraw will also fluctuate from year-to-year.

The [[Variable percentage withdrawal]] spreadsheet takes into account the projected maximal length of your retirement and your portfolio's asset allocation (division between stocks and bonds) to compute a table of increasing withdrawal percentages for each projected year of retirement. Each year, multiply your portfolio balance by that year's percentage to get the actual withdrawal dollar amount.

The advantage of this method is its ability to let you spend most of your portfolio, but with the assurance of never running out of money before the end of the selected depletion period. It is also very simple to use: just multiply your portfolio balance each year by that year's withdrawal percentage. The disadvantage is your withdrawal amounts will always fluctuate with your portfolio’s value. You'll have to spend less in years when your portfolio value drops. But, as you are spending an increasing percentage of your portfolio each year, you'll have more than if you had selected a constant-percentage withdrawal. You might prefer this method if you have year-to-year flexibility in spending, and you have no bequest motives.

|}

==Spend only the dividends==
If you wish to keep your principal investment amount intact, you might consider using a method where you only spend the dividend and interest income from your investments.

The advantage is clear, but like the constant percentage method, it may result in fluctuating income amounts as dividend and interest income rates for your investments change. Also, while having a large bond percentage will increase your interest income with this method, having too few growth investments exposes you to the risk of not keeping up with inflation over the long term.
You might prefer this method if your expenses are small in relation to your portfolio size, and if you wish to leave a large amount to your heirs.

==Asset allocation during withdrawal==
When you take money out of your portfolio, you should consider more than just the method of withdrawal.  Consider your current asset allocation between stocks and bonds, and decide if your allocation will be changed during the withdrawal phase.
Most withdrawal method studies, including the famous [[Safe withdrawal rates#Trinity Study|Trinity Study]], assume annual rebalancing of the portfolio using a constant ratio between stocks and bonds. 

However, the reality is many retirees prefer not to keep a static stock/bond allocation throughout retirement.  They gradually reduce their stock allocation and increase their bond allocation – they move toward a more conservative allocation.  One popular method Bogleheads use is to adjust the stock/bond allocation each year so that the bond percentage is equal to the owner’s age. This means you would make a 1% portfolio allocation adjustment every year.

===Constant-dollar (age in bonds)===
Let’s look at how changing your allocation each year would work, and particularly what happens when you combine age-in-bonds with the [[#Constant-dollar | constant-dollar method detailed before]]. First, let’s quickly review constant-dollar. Your first yearly withdrawal will be based on a percentage of your investment portfolio (say 4%). In subsequent years, the withdrawal is no longer based on your portfolio value, but is your first year’s withdrawal amount, adjusted for inflation each year thereafter.

Look at the Figure 5 below and compare it to the first constant-dollar graph, Figure 1 above. You can see the effect from changing the stock/bond allocation each year to be equal to the person's age. The graph shows this change for ages 55-90.

:{| style = "width:500px;"
|+'''Figure 5: Graph of constant-dollar yearly withdrawals and remaining portfolio value. Bond percentage adjusted each year to equal age.'''
|-
|align = "center"|[[File:ConstantDollarAgeInBonds.jpg|450px]]

|}

Again, the advantage is that your withdrawals are predictable and constant in real dollar terms - always equal to your first withdrawal, and then adjusted each year for inflation. But a new disadvantage is that your overall portfolio value will decline at a faster rate, especially during the later years.  The reason is because each year you are increasing your withdrawals at the same time you are reducing the growth part of the portfolio - stocks.  Therefore, you have to use a greater portion of your principal in the later years to keep up with inflation.  On average, the more in bonds you hold each year the lower will be your overall returns.  If you do not intend to leave a lot on the table for your heirs and you would rather not deal with market volatility in your final years, this might be a good approach.

===Constant-percentage (age in bonds)===
Next, let’s use the same age-in-bonds approach just demonstrated for the Constant-Dollar method and apply it to the [[#Constant-percentage|constant-percentage method]]. First, let’s review constant-percentage.  You withdraw the same percentage annually from your current portfolio balance. Recall that the value of your portfolio will change based on the ups and downs of the financial markets, so the dollar amount you withdraw will fluctuate from year-to-year.

Look at the Figure 6 below and compare it to the first constant-percentage graph, Figure 2 above. You can see the effect from changing the stock/bond allocation each year to be equal to the person's age. The graph shows this change for ages 55-90. 

:{| style = "width:500px;"
|+ '''Figure 6: Graph of constant-percentage yearly withdrawals and remaining portfolio value. Bond percentage adjusted each year to equal age.'''
|-
|align = "center"|[[File:ConstantPercentageAgeInBonds.jpg|450px]]
|}

Again, your annual withdrawals aren't automatically increased for inflation; instead, this method counts on long-term portfolio growth to take care of inflation. Since the portfolio allocation becomes more conservative each year, its growth in total value will be less since you have a higher bond allocation each year based on age. However, the year-to-year portfolio withdrawal differences are also minimized because the increased bond allocation improved the stability of returns. Look at the down market of 2000-2002. In this chart example, the person was older and had a larger allocation to bonds.  When you combine Constant-Percentage with age-in-bonds, changes in your annual withdrawal amounts are more smoothed than if you use Constant-Percentage alone. 

==Alternative withdrawal methods==
===Combination===
There are many alternative withdrawal methods. The following method is based on the Galeno Strategy and is intended to be representative of many of the alternative methods which are generally designed to overcome one or more disadvantages of the constant-dollar or constant-percentage withdrawal methods.

:'''Constant-dollar'''
::&lt;u&gt;Disadvantage&lt;/u&gt;: Does not take into account the fluctuations of overall portfolio value. Many people would like to be able to take out a bit more during a big bull market when their portfolio value is climbing. Those same people would also likely feel uncomfortable taking an ever-increasing inflation-adjusted withdrawal during a multi-year bear market.
::&lt;u&gt;Alternative&lt;/u&gt;: Take the market value of your portfolio into account by moving a fixed percentage of your stock allocation over to your bond allocation every year.

:'''Constant-percentage'''
::&lt;u&gt;Disadvantage&lt;/u&gt;: Withdrawal amount may have considerable year-to-year fluctuations.
::&lt;u&gt;Alternative&lt;/u&gt;: Smooth fluctuations by having yearly withdrawals be an average of 7½ years of bond allocation value.

Using this particular example alternative withdrawal method, 7½ years worth of withdrawals are held in bonds, the rest of the portfolio in stocks. Refer to Figure 6. As an example, to match up initial withdrawals and initial portfolio allocations with the graphs relating to the other methods, we will start with a $1,000,000 portfolio. The initial allocation being 70% stocks and 30% bonds. The initial yearly withdrawal being $40,000 (or 4% of initial portfolio value). The 30% in bonds would equate to $300,000 of the portfolio, which would be 7½ years worth of withdrawals, assuming $40,000 being withdrawn each year ($300,000 divided by $40,000 = 7½).

:{| style = "width:500px;"
|+ '''Figure 7: Graph of the alternative combination method Galeno Strategy yearly withdrawals and remaining portfolio value.'''
|-
|align = "center"|[[File:Galeno.jpg|450px]]
|}

In subsequent years, 6% of the stock allocation of the remaining portfolio is sold and moved to the bond allocation. This is done each and every year, and will result in a differing amount being moved each year depending on stock market performance. This is the part of the method that is an alternative to the constant-dollar method not taking into fluctuating account value.

The 6% of the stock allocation that is sold each year is added to the bond allocation. The new yearly withdrawal amount is then figured by dividing the total bond amount by 7½. The fluctuating amount that is moved from stocks to bonds each year is smoothed by having the bond allocation contain 7½ years worth of withdrawals. As stocks go up, the bond allocation will gradually be increased and allow higher yearly withdrawals. Conversely, as stocks go down, the bond allocation will gradually be decreased and slowly result in lower yearly withdrawals. However, since there is a 7½ year buffer of withdrawals in bonds, year-to-year withdrawal amounts are smoothed and do not fluctuate greatly. This is the part of the method that is an alternative to the constant-percentage method having considerable year-to-year fluctuations of withdrawal amounts.

Overall, an alternative method is usually preferred by someone who would like to keep relatively smooth year-to-year withdrawals while also taking into account fluctuations in their overall portfolio value.

===Glide-path allocation===
As mentioned above in the [[#Asset allocation during withdrawal|asset allocation during withdrawal]] section, many people prefer not to keep a static stock/bond allocation throughout their retirement, but to gradually have their portfolio become more conservative by reducing the stock allocation and increasing the bond allocation as they age. However, the rule-of-thumb method where your bond percentage is equal to your age is sometimes seen as a bit too conservative. Another method, similar to the allocations used by some retirement-date funds is to follow a ''glide-path'' allocation change that isn't necessarily directly linear, as is the bonds=age method. Often, a glide-path method will add bonds to the portfolio mix more slowly in the early years before retirement, thus allowing the portfolio more possibility for growth before retirement. Then, after retirement, the glide-path may transition more quickly to a bond-heavy allocation, thus shielding the portfolio from stock market volatility during later retirement years.

Figure 8 below shows a graph comparing the ''(100-age)'' stock allocation and the ''Log(100-age)-1'' glide-path allocation. The blue (100-age) line is linear, changing the allocation by 1% each year. The glide-path allocation changes more slowly in the earlier years, presumably allowing for more portfolio growth during the accumulation years, and then turns quicker towards a more conservative allocation during the retirement years, eventually becoming more conservative and following a 100% bond allocation for age 90 and later.

:{| style = "width:500px;"

|-
|align = "center"|[[File:Logglidepath.jpg|450px]]
|}

As with the similar ''bonds equal age'' method in Figure 5 [[#Constant-percentage (age in bonds |above]], following a glide-path stock/bond allocation allows the overall portfolio to become more conservative each year. The results, shown in Figure 9 below, are similar to the bonds equal age method, but in the time-period shown in the graph, the slower transition to bonds allowed the overall portfolio to grow a bit more, resulting in slightly more money being withdrawn from the portfolio, while retaining a similar volatility.

|}

===1/N withdrawal amounts===
A common issue when using a typical retirement withdrawal method is that the percentage withdrawn usually assumes the worst-case scenario. That is, the recommended percentage is one that, in the past, would have allowed you to weather the storm of the worst bear market, should it have occurred during your period of retirement. While it is generally considered safe and prudent to assume the worst, what often happens during a retirement period is that the markets perform better than the worst-case scenario, thus increasing your portfolio more than may have been forecast in that worst-case scenario - sometimes much more. If one continues to follow a withdrawal method based on their initial portfolio value at retirement, this unexpected growth may result in their leaving a significant amount of money unspent during their retirement. And while it is often a goal to leave some money to children or relatives, people may also wish that they had spent a bit more money while they had the chance.

One method to allow spending more money from the portfolio during the years you expect to draw from it is to not spend a percentage based on the portfolio's value, but rather spend a percentage based on how long you expect the portfolio to last. A simplistic example which assumes no portfolio growth or inflation concerns would be to imagine that you happen to have a million dollars under your mattress that you wish to make last for 10 years. A 'safe' withdrawal rate would then logically be that you could spend 1/10th of the portfolio each year, giving you a steady withdrawal amount of $100,000 each year for the next 10 years.

A 1/N withdrawal method is similar to this. 'N' being equal to the number of years you need to draw on the portfolio. Each year the 'N' number is readjusted, resulting in a higher percentage being withdrawn from the portfolio. Normally, withdrawing a higher percentage is considered possibly unsafe, as it may result in the portfolio being eventually depleted. However, using a 1/N withdrawal method typically assumes spending the entire portfolio, so large withdrawal percentages aren't a concern. Suppose you had one year to live, then what would a 'safe' withdrawal percentage be? A typical 4%? No, since you know the portfolio only has to last one year, then that means you can, over the course of that year, withdraw 100% of the portfolio.

The N number is readjusted each year, meaning that for a portfolio that you wish to draw from for 20 years would allow a 1/20th of the total portfolio value to be withdrawn the first year, 1/19th the second, and so on. Figure 9 shows a graph of withdrawals over a 37-year period that is the same as shown in the other graphs in this article. One big difference you may notice in this graph is that while the amounts withdrawn are similar to other methods in the early years, the amounts grow rapidly and huge as time goes on. This is due to the fact that with a know expiration date of the portfolio, larger and larger percentages are withdrawn. In order to keep the same Y-axis size as the other graphs in this article, Figure 9 also shows yearly withdrawals only up to $400,000, but in actuality, over the time period in Figure 9, the last eight years all allowed for withdrawals over $400,000, and, in fact, ended in the last year with a withdrawal amount of nearly $600,000, clearly the highest of any method, albeit at the expense of leaving no remaining portfolio.

:{| style = "width:500px;"
|+'''Figure 10: Graph of ''1/N'' of portfolio value yearly withdrawals and remaining portfolio value. Stock percentage decreased each year according to a ''Log(100-age)-1'' glide-path.'''
|-
|align = "center"|[[File:Logoneovern.jpg|450px]]
|}

Now you may have noticed in the last paragraph the one potential monkey-wrench in a 1/N withdrawal method - the N number (i.e. how long you will live) can't be forecast with perfect accuracy. It's all well and good to plan on needing to withdraw from your portfolio for 27 years, but if you spend it all down in that time and then happen to live 28 years, that's certainly going to be a problem! This problem can be solved by considering the 1/N withdrawal amount to be a maximum for the particular year, as in "I can withdraw ''up to'' 1/N this year". Since the withdrawal amounts using this method, or any similar method which uses up the portfolio, can become so large, it is quite easy to spend less than the full amount, thus preserving a portion of the portfolio for potential years beyond 'N'. So while this method, like the others, still involves making some assumptions about the future, it can result in your being able to withdraw much more from your portfolio during retirement, as long as you don't plan on leaving a large legacy.

A '''bond''' is a debt investment. Investors loan money to corporations or governments for a set term and interest rate. After they have been issued, bonds trade on the over-the-counter market, where their principal value fluctuates according to changes in interest rates and any changes in the bond's credit quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.investinginbonds.com/learnmore.asp?catid=3&amp;id=383| publisher=Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association| title=Risks of Investing in Bonds| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220331004748/https://www.investinginbonds.com/learnmore.asp?catid=3&amp;id=383| archive-date=March 31, 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newly issued [[Corporate bonds | corporate bonds]] are syndicated by investment banks who initially buy an offering for resale to investors. Government bonds are offered by auction, where investors tender bids for the issue.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikipedia:Bond (finance)| Bond (finance)]], from Wikipedia&lt;/ref&gt; Investors typically use bonds to stabilize the value of a portfolio, or to produce a stream of income, or both.

For a very basic introduction to stocks, start with the [[#Tutorial | tutorial]] at the bottom of this page.

==Features==

[[File:Bonddiagram.gif|frame|400px|right| Advanced Bond Concepts:Bond Type Specifics, Investopedia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/022516/understanding-different-types-bond-yields.asp| title=Understanding the Different Types of Bond Yields| publisher=Investopedia| date=September 30, 2022| accessdate=August 13, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Bonds have some distinctive features. These include:
*'''Coupon rate''': the interest rate paid by the bond. The rate may be fixed, floating, or inflation indexed, depending on the specific issue. The coupon date gives the frequency of interest payments, usually biannually for US bonds. Bonds which pay a fixed coupon rate based upon the principal (face amount) are called [[Nominal bond |''nominal'' bonds]].
*'''Maturity date''': the date at which the bond principal will be repaid. Bonds are usually issued with maturities [[Money markets | ranging from 1 year]] to thirty years.
*'''Options''': the most common option involving bonds is a '''call feature'''. This gives the issuer the right to repay the bond before the maturity date. Because an issuer will call bonds when the interest rate is lower than the coupon rate, it is not advantageous to the buyer of the bond, who must then reinvest the proceeds of the redeemed bond in a lower interest rate environment. Because of this, a callable bond usually offers a higher coupon than an uncallable bond, to compensate for the risk of early redemption. Some callable bonds also add a small sum to the par value of a redeemed bond. Alternatively, some bonds are issued with a '''put feature''' which gives the bond holder the right to force the issuer to repay the bond before the maturity date, usually on predefined put dates.
*'''Sinking funds''' provide a means of repaying a bond issue. The issuer makes periodic payments to a trustee who retires part of the issue by purchasing the bonds in the open market. Sinking funds tend to reduce the risk of default, which lets the issuer of a bond to pay a lower interest rate on the bond. 
*'''Senior debt''' and '''Subordinated debt''': [[Wikipedia:Senior debt|Senior debt]] has priority over other debt in case of default; [[Wikipedia:Subordinated debt|Subordinated debt]] is unsecured and, in a default, is [[Wikipedia:Bond (finance)| repayable]] after other debts have been paid.

==Types of bonds==

There are three main issuers of bonds in the U.S.: the Treasury; corporations; and municipalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Annette Thau| title=The Bond Book| publisher=McGraw-Hill| date=2001| pages=29-36| isbn=0-07-135862-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Treasury bonds===
'''[[Treasury Bonds]]''' are issued by the US treasury in groups of three maturity ranges
*Bills have a range up to one year;
*Notes have a range between one year and ten years;
*Bonds have a range greater than ten years. 

Treasury bonds are usually not callable. Treasuries also carry the full faith and credit backing of the U.S. government. The interest income is exempt from state tax. You can purchase Treasuries through brokerages and banks as well as through an individual account at [https://www.treasurydirect.gov/marketable-securities/treasury-bills/ Treasury Direct]. Government agencies also issue debt, some of which is backed by the full faith and credit of the government, and some which is not.

'''[[Treasury Inflation Protected Securities]]''' (TIPS) give you both inflation indexed income and inflation protection for the bond's principal. The bond pays a fixed real interest rate based on a principal value indexed to the CPI-U inflation measure. Like all treasury bonds, inflation indexed treasuries have the "full faith and credit" backing of the Treasury and interest income and inflation adjusted accruals are exempt from state taxation. However, you must pay federal tax annually on the inflation adjusted accruals. This tax on "phantom income" means that you should try to hold these bonds in tax-advantaged accounts.

===Corporate bonds===
'''[[Corporate bonds]]''' are issued by corporations and are often callable. Because a corporation can default on its debts, corporate bonds have credit risk, and so usually pay higher coupon interest rates over comparable term treasury maturities as compensation for this risk. Corporate bonds are taxable, both for federal and for state income tax. 

===Municipal bonds===
'''[[Municipal bonds]]''' are issued by states and localities. These bonds have credit risk. Many municipal bonds are also callable. The bonds are generally exempt from federal tax, although some private revenue municipal bonds are subject to the federal alternative minimum tax. A tax exempt bond is also usually state tax exempt for residents of the state issuing the bond. Because of these tax preferences, municipal bonds usually offer lower coupon interest rates than do comparable term treasuries and corporate bonds. 

===Other types of bonds===

====Zero-coupon bonds====
'''[[Zero-coupon bond |Zero Coupon bonds]]''' are accrual bonds and do not pay current coupon interest. They are issued at a deep discount from par value and compound continuously at the coupon rate. Holders receive the full principal amount as well as the value that has accrued from interest on the redemption date. Financial institutions can create zero coupon bonds from fixed rate bonds by "stripping off" the coupons. In other words, the coupons and the final principal payment of the bond are separate, and trade independently. Holders pay tax on the annual accrual of income, although they receive no current interest payment.

====Asset-backed securities====
'''[[Asset-backed securities]]''' are bonds whose interest and principal payments are backed by underlying cash flows from other assets. Examples of asset-backed securities are [[Mortgage-backed security|mortgage-backed securities]] (MBSs), which include GNMA securities backed by the full faith and credit of the US treasury, collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs) and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), whose underlying securities are often assets such as auto loans or credit card receivables.

====High yield bonds====
'''[[High yield bonds]]''' are corporate bonds with lower credit quality than top credits. These companies are at much greater risk of default than higher quality credits and, as a result, pay higher coupon interest rates than comparable high quality corporate bonds.

==Sources of return==

There are three sources of return for a bond:
# Return of principal
# Interest (coupon payments)
# Interest-on-interest (reinvested coupon payments)

According to [[Frank J. Fabozzi]] in the ''The Handbook of Fixed Income Securities'' (1991, page 97):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Frank J. Fabozzi| author-link=Frank J. Fabozzi| title=The Handbook of Fixed Income Securities| date=2005| publisher=McGraw-Hill| isbn=978-0071440998}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{blockquote|In high interest rate environments, the interest-on-interest component for long-term bonds may be as high as 70 percent of the bond's potential total dollar return.}}
In low interest rate environments, the principal is likely the largest source of value of all but the longest bonds. The figure below illustrates the three sources of bond return:

[[File:Sources_of_bond_return.png|800px]]

==Risks==

Each of the following risks of bonds carries some premium as compensation for bearing these risks. The amount of that premium varies according to the market's assessment of the likelihood of the adverse event occurring.

===Interest rate risk===

Interest rate risk, also called price risk, is that the value of a bond fluctuates depending on the interest rate. Also known as "market risk." The amount of interest rate risk assumed is measured primarily by the [[Bonds: advanced topics#Duration | duration]], and secondarily by [[Bonds: advanced topics#Convexity | convexity]]. See [[#Bonds on the secondary_market | below]] for more information on how bond prices react to interest rate changes.

Interest rate risk is in some sense an artifact of the traditional framework which looks at short-term returns. Over longer periods, longer duration bonds will have a more certain return than short-term bonds, as a quote from John Campbell and Luis Viceira's academic text, ''Strategic Asset Allocation'' (pages 86-87), makes clear:
{{blockquote|If one uses conventional mean-variance analysis, it is hard to explain why any investors hold large positions in bonds. Mean-variance analysis treats cash as the riskless asset and bonds as merely another risky asset like stocks. Bonds are valued only for their potential contribution to the short-run excess return, relative to risk, of a diversified risky portfolio. ... A long-horizon analysis treats bonds very differently, and assigns them a much more important role in the optimal portfolio. For long-term investors, money market investments are not riskless because they must be rolled over at uncertain future interest rates.}}

Because unexpected inflation changes that picture somewhat, the reduced risk of longer-term bonds is primarily true when discussing inflation-protected bonds in real dollars (or nominal bonds with nominal liabilities).

===Credit risk===

Credit risk is a risk that the issuer of a bond may default. Also known as "default risk." 

The major ratings agencies (Moody's, S&amp;P, and Fitch) assess credit risk.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Moody's Investors Service, Fitch, and Standard &amp; Poor's Ratings Services are three of several credit rating agencies the SEC categorizes as a [http://www.sec.gov/answers/nrsro.htm Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (NRSRO)]. The SEC's Office of Credit Ratings maintains a list here: [http://www.sec.gov/ocr/ratingagency.html Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations ("NRSROs")]&lt;/ref&gt; Each [[#Credit ratings | credit rating]] has an expected rate of default, which increases substantially in lower tiers. For a given credit rating, the default rate has historically been lower for municipal bonds than for corporate bonds. Wikipedia has [[wikipedia:Bond credit rating | tables]]] of how the ratings compare between ratings firms and of historical default rates.

===Call risk===

Call risk is a risk that the issuer may call the bond, terminating a stream of income for investors. This risk is often called prepayment risk for [[Mortgage Backed Securities | mortgage backed securities]]. Call options embedded in a bond lead to negative [[convexity]].

===Reinvestment risk===

Reinvestment risk is a risk that when a bond matures or is called, an investor may have to reinvest the proceeds in a bond yielding a lower interest.

===Inflation risk===

Inflation risk is a risk that the interest from a bond may not keep up with inflation. [[Treasury_Inflation_Protected_Securities|TIPS]] are inflation-adjusted and therefore largely immune to inflation risk. Also known as "purchasing power risk."

===Liquidity risk===

Liquidity risk is the risk that you may not be able to extract the remaining value from your bond in the timeframe needed without losing a disproportionate amount of value. Thinly-traded issues (such as most corporate, municipal, and TIPS issues) have liquidity risk. The liquidity premium is expected to rise in times of crisis. Also known as "marketability risk."

Liquidity risk can be seen most clearly in "off-the-run" Treasury bonds, where an older but otherwise identical bond trades at a reduced price (or higher yield) simply because it is less liquid.

=== Other risks ===

These risks are either not important for individual investors or are generally wrapped into the risks above (for example, credit risk commonly encompasses event risk). They are included here for completeness.

* '''Yield curve or maturity risk''': Generally only important in hedging situations.
* '''Exchange rate or currency risk''': Only relevant for non-dollar-denominated bonds. [[John Bogle]] does not recommend these.
* '''Volatility risk''': Volatility affects bonds with embedded options (commonly a corporate bond with a call option), because an option's value depends on volatility. If the price of an issue is highly volatile, the likelihood of a random fluctuation straying above the strike price is much greater.
* '''Political or legal risk''': Tax-code changes and regulatory decisions can all affect the value of a bond. 
* '''Event risk''': A type of credit risk which affects many firms due to a single event (and therefore event risk cannot be fully diversified away).
* '''Sector risk''': A type of credit risk which affects all or many firms in a single sector.

==Credit ratings==

Three major ratings agencies assess the likelihood of a bond defaulting and assign that bond ratings according to a standardized scale.

|+ Bond ratings&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.investopedia.com/articles/03/102203.asp| title=Understanding Bond Ratings| publisher=Investopedia| date=August 6, 2023| accessdate=August 13, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|}

For a given credit rating, the default rate has historically been lower for municipal bonds than for corporate bonds.

==Factors affecting bond prices==
{{main|Bond pricing}}
See [[Bond pricing]] for definitions of bond pricing terminology. (This is an advanced topic.)

===New issues===
Two major factors primarily set the coupon of a newly issued bond: the credit quality of the bond, and the maturity of the bond. Investors taking on higher risks expect higher return. Because of this, the US Treasury can pay a lower coupon on its debt than corporate borrowers, who are subject to default risk. Three credit rating agencies trade non treasury debt. The table above describes the ratings.

The longer the maturity of a bond, the greater the risk to the bondholder. Longer time horizons increase the likelihood that a bond issuer will become a greater credit risk through bad management decisions, the deterioration of economic conditions, or the company engaging in future merger and acquisition activity which changes the leverage of a company's balance sheet. Longer horizons also increase the likelihood that a bond's coupon income will be eroded by higher than expected inflation.

Finance economics defines a bond's expected return as comprising three basic building blocks:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author1=Elroy Dimson| author1-link=Elroy Dimson| author2=Paul R. Marsh| author3=Mike Staunton| title=Triumph of the Optimists: 101 Years of Global Investment Return| publisher=Princeton University Press| date=2002| pages=89-90| isbn=0-691-09194-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Default risk premium''': the risk-free rate as defined by the current yield of a treasury bill
* '''Time horizon premium''': a time horizon premium to compensate investors for the risks of longer maturities
* '''T-bill rate''': and a default risk premium to compensate investors for bearing credit risk.

===Bonds on the secondary market===

Once a bond is issued, it trades on the secondary market, and fluctuates in price until it matures. A bond will change in price for two main reasons:
* The bond's credit rating has changed (either upgraded or downgraded).
* Interest rates have changed.

Unless a bond is falling into or out of default, price movements associated with changes in credit rating are usually infrequent, although during periods of economic distress and economic recovery credit rating changes can be significant price factors. The ever present driver of changes in a bond's market value comes from fluctuations in current market interest rates.

An example can illustrate how bond pricing works. Suppose you purchase, at issue, a $1,000 ten year bond yielding a 5% coupon. This entitles you to $50 of annual income. Then, suppose that one year later, interest rates have risen to 6% and you wish to liquidate the bond. No rational investor will pay you $1,000 for $50 of income, when they can receive $60 annually for the same $1,000 dollar investment. In this scenario, your 5% bond will have to decrease in market value until its current yield approximately produces a 6% return.

A similar, yet opposite price movement occurs if interest rates fall. Suppose instead that interest rates fall to 4 percent during the year after your purchase. Your $1,000 bond produces $50 of annual income in an environment where investors can only receive $40 of annual income from a newly issued bond. Your bond will therefore rise in price until it provides a purchaser with a 4% return.

This is the basic rule of bond price movements in the open market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Annette Thau| title=The Bond Book| publisher=McGraw-Hill| date=2001| page=30| isbn=0-07-135862-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{| class=wikitable style="text-align:center" width=400px
| align="center" style="background:#f0f0f0;"|'''When'''
| align="center" style="background:#f0f0f0;"|'''Then'''
|-
| interest rates rise||bond prices fall
|-
| interest rates fall||bond prices rise
|}

To calculate how much prices will rise or fall, please see [[Bonds:_Advanced_Topics#Duration | Duration]].

A corollary to this is that, all other things being equal, price fluctuations are greater for long maturities than for shorter maturities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Annette Thau| title=The Bond Book| publisher=McGraw-Hill| date=2001| page=73| isbn=0-07-135862-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; At any given time in the secondary market you are likely to find any number of bonds selling at a discount over par value, or at a premium to par value.

==Role in a portfolio==
Investors typically use bonds to stabilize the value of a portfolio, or to produce a stream of income, or both. For more see [[Asking bond questions]] for tips on how to ask about bonds on the [http://www.bogleheads.org/forum/index.php Forum].

===Long- vs. short-term===

Boglehead and financial expert [[William Bernstein]] recommends limiting bond holdings to short-term funds,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=William Bernstein| date=December 30, 2009| url=https://archive.nytimes.com/bucks.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/12/30/pascal-and-the-long-term-bond-dilemma/ |title=Pascal and the long-term bond dilemma| publisher=New York Times| accessdate=August 13, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; because of their relative immunity to the risk of unexpected inflation.

However, an article by Vanguard&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://personal.vanguard.com/us/insights/article/duration-diversification-052015| title=The long and short of finding bond balance| date=June 12, 2015| publisher=Vanguard| accessdate=March 21, 2016}}{{dead link}}&lt;/ref&gt; argues that when the yield curve is particularly steep, running to short-term bonds for safety can result in losses if the yield curve flattens.

A common recommendation of other experts is intermediate-term funds. Long-term bonds have historically returned no more than intermediate-term bonds, but with far greater volatility--in other words, their risk has not been rewarded. Yale endowment manager David Swensen recommends long-term Treasuries, however, as part of a portfolio dominated by equities, as they will provide the biggest counterweight to the collapse of other asset classes during a deflationary crisis.

Even proponents of short-term bonds such as Dr. Bernstein are comfortable with longer-term holdings in inflation-protected securities such as [[Treasury_Inflation_Protected_Securities | TIPS]], as they no longer carry any risk of unexpected inflation, leaving them vulnerable only to a real rate rise (which if held to the duration incurs only an opportunity cost).

While you should always keep the [[Bonds:_Advanced_Topics#Duration | duration]] less than or equal to your investment horizon, unless you have a specific funding need to be met at a specific date (in which case a [[Zero-coupon bond]] is the risk-free solution), you should choose between short-term and intermediate-term funds. The former is lower risk but the latter has historically given investors higher overall returns.

===Credit quality===

The ''[[Bogleheads' Guide To Investing]]'' authors recommend Vanguard's Total Bond Market, which contains investment-grade [[Corporate bonds |corporate bonds]]. [[John Bogle]] also recommends Total Bond Market, although he seems to prefer Vanguard's Intermediate-Term Index Fund for its lack of [[MBS]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| date=June 15, 2007| url=https://johncbogle.com/wordpress/2007/06/15/john-bogle-responds-to-ask-jack-questions-2/| title=John Bogle responds to "Ask Jack" questions| publisher= The Bogle Eblog}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, Boglehead and bond expert [[Larry Swedroe]] recommends only the very highest quality investments for bonds (and specifically recommends against Total Bond Market because of its negative [[Bonds:_Advanced_Topics#Convexity | convexity]]), citing evidence in which the risk of corporate bonds has not historically rewarded investors. Yale endowment manager David Swensen also recommends only Treasuries.

Finally, Boglehead and financial expert Rick Ferri advocates for not only the inclusion of investment-grade corporate bonds but also [[High yield bonds | high yield bonds]], on the basis of their diversification benefits.

Perhaps the best conclusion that can be drawn from the highly respected but conflicting advice is to:
* Ensure that your bond holdings are built around a core of Treasuries.
* If you choose to include corporate bonds, understand the risks you are taking (moderate in relation to stock investing but nevertheless quite real), and do not include too high a proportion. A good benchmark would be the market portfolio represented by Vanguard's Total Bond Market fund.
* If you choose to include high-yield bonds which incorporate considerable default and call risk, you take the funds from the equity portion of your asset allocation rather than the bond portion.

===Taxes===

Almost all of the return on a bond or bond fund comes from the dividend yield, which is fully taxed; in contrast, stocks get most of their return from price appreciation, which is not taxed until the stocks are sold and is taxed at the capital-gains tax rate. Therefore, when bond interest rates are relatively high, bonds are widely regarded as being [[Principles_of_Tax-Efficient_Fund_Placement | less tax-efficient than stock index funds]] (which rarely sell stock) and should be held in tax-deferred accounts when possible.

If you are in a high tax bracket and without sufficient taxable space, [[Municipal bonds]] are likely the preferred solution; these bonds are not taxed but there is a cost in lower yield. If you are in low tax brackets, you should calculate your after-tax return on taxable bonds in taxable accounts to determine whether or not to use municipal bonds.

==Style boxes==
"Style boxes" are 3&amp;nbsp;x&amp;nbsp;3 grids that categorize securities. Different investment styles have various levels of risk which leads to differences in returns. This visualization allows investors to compare securities using an easy-to-understand standardized format.

Fixed income funds (bonds) classify risk as levels of [[#Credit risk | credit risk]] (credit quality) on the vertical axis, and [[#Interest rate risk | interest rate risk]] (term risk) on the horizontal axis.

There are a number of ways to characterize interest rate risk, such as [[:Bonds: Advanced Topics#Duration | duration]] (sensitivity to changes in interest rates) and various maturity measures. In either case, the objective is to categorize interest rate risk into short-term, intermediate-term, and long-term periods of time.

Morningstar (interest rate sensitivity) and Vanguard (maturity) provide fixed income fund ''style boxes''. Either format can be used to compare funds, but compare using the same methodology. When comparing ''only'' Vanguard funds, Vanguard's style box is valid. Otherwise, if no Vanguard style box is available, use Morningstar's style box for all funds. Vanguard funds will be shown on Morningstar's site using the Morningstar style box.&lt;ref&gt;{{Forum link| p=948589| title=9-style box - Vanguard vs M*t}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stock Basics#Style Boxes | Equity style boxes]] (stock funds) and fixed income style boxes (bond funds) represent two-dimensional (horizontal and vertical axis) views of risk versus return. However, the background behind these boxes is based on very different concepts. '''Only compare stocks-to-stocks and bonds-to-bonds.'''

Both equity and fixed income style boxes are a way to visualize how diversified your portfolio is with respect to the main characteristic of each asset class - size and value for equities; credit risk and term risk for fixed income.&lt;ref&gt;{{Forum link| p=757434| title=Style boxes - Why the differences? Some questions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, you are interested in Vanguard's balanced funds&lt;ref&gt;[https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/tools/stylebox?View=Fund&amp;Cat=Domestic_Balanced_Balanced Vanguard balanced funds], Vanguard, style boxes&lt;/ref&gt; which contain both stock and bond funds. The style boxes show you a simple collection of colored boxes, and this can make asset allocation decisions easier.

Portfolio ''slice and dice'' is intended for &lt;u&gt;experienced investors only&lt;/u&gt;.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' means dividing your allocation within a given single [[Asset class | asset class]], such as [[Stock basics |stocks]]. Adding asset classes to a portfolio ([[Bond basics |bonds]],&lt;ref group="note"&gt;A bond is not a unitary asset class, because the segments of the bond market (that is, [[Treasury bonds|treasuries]], [[Corporate bonds|corporates]], [[Municipal bonds|municipals]], [[Asset-backed securities|asset-backed]], [[Mortgage-backed securities|mortgage securities]], [[Treasury Inflation Protected Securities|inflation indexed securities]], [[Zero-coupon bond|zero coupon]]) are all discrete. However, this restriction has been dropped over time (refer to the "[[#Usage|Usage]]" section).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gold |gold]], [[Commodities|commodities]]) is [[Asset allocation|asset allocation]], not slicing and dicing. ''Slice and dice'' portfolios are essentially diversified portfolios that aim to beat the broad market index by systematically overweighting various sectors.&lt;ref name="telltale"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://johncbogle.com/speeches/JCB_Morningstar_6-02.pdf| title=The Telltale Chart| author=John Bogle| author-link=John Bogle| date=June 26, 2002| accessdate=January 5, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its simplest form, the idea is to obtain excess returns by holding a portfolio that:&lt;ref name="telltale"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Paraphrased from the original text, as suggested by Barry Barnitz. See the [[Talk:Slice and dice | discussion tab]] above.&lt;/ref&gt;
:a) splits the market portfolio among sub-asset classes that are deemed likely to deliver superior returns;
:b) holds higher weightings of size and value sub-asset classes that have lower correlations with the market; and
:c) periodically rebalances each sub-asset class to its original weight. 

This contrasts with ''total stock market'' investing, which approximates the entire market as a single asset class.

The theoretical justification for ''slice and dice'' rests on the benefits of what is often called "diversification". However, in this context the word is used with a specific technical meaning. It refers to asset classes with low correlation coefficients. The benefit comes from the fact that a mixture of assets with low correlation will have better risk-adjusted returns than either of them taken by itself. A well-known example is that even though [[Domestic/International |international stocks]] are riskier than domestic stocks, adding a moderate amount of international stocks to domestic stocks slightly reduces the risk of the domestic stocks.&lt;ref name="nisi"&gt;{{forum link| p=853767| title=What is "Slice and Dice"?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
''Slice and dice'' is based on research by [[Eugene F. Fama]] and [[Kenneth R. French]] in their 1992 paper, ''The Cross Section of Expected Stock Returns'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.ivey.uwo.ca/media/3775518/the_cross-section_of_expected_stock_returns.pdf| title=The Cross Section of Expected Stock Returns| author1=Eugene F. Fama| author1-link=Eugene F. Fama| author2-link=Kenneth R. French| author2=Kenneth R. French| publisher=The Journal of Finance| date=June 1992| accessdate=January 5, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt; which introduced the [[Fama and French three-factor model | three factor model]]. By the mid and latter part of the nineties, investment advisors and some individuals began considering, and then implementing, portfolios based on the market, size, and value factors, compared to holding a "market cap" US stock index portfolio, such as the [[S&amp;P 500 index]] or a Total Market index.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;This section is based on an email from Barry Barnitz.&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally, the portfolio most widely used for theoretical discussion was the 4x25 ''slice and dice'', based on the "four corners" (quadrants) of the Fama and French three factor world: large growth, large value, [[Small caps | small growth, and small value]]. These quadrants are created by splitting the stocks as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.efficientfrontier.com/ef/702/3FM-10.htm| title=The Cross-Section of Expected Stock Returns| author=William Bernstein| author1-link=William Bernstein| publisher=Efficient Frontier| accessdate=January 5, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Split vertically: "Large" is size deciles one through five of the CRSP (Center for Research in Security Prices) database,&lt;ref group="note" name="crsp" /&gt; and "Small," deciles six through ten.
*Split horizontally: "Value" and "Growth" are defined as the bottom and top 30% of stocks sorted by price/book.

Advisors and portfolio theorists arguing for ''slice and dice'' (including [[William Bernstein]], [[Larry Swedroe]], and Jeff Troutner) considered market cap indexes as dominated by growth stocks and were used as the growth proxies in ''slice and dice'' portfolios.

As an example, a four quadrant ''slice and dice'' portfolio consisting of S&amp;P indexes (available in the late 1990s or early 2000s) would have consisted of the following:

*S&amp;P 500 (25%)
*S&amp;P 500 Value (25%)
*S&amp;P 600 (25%)
*S&amp;P 600 Value (25%)

This 4x25 allocation is the scheme [[John Bogle]] analysed in his "Telltale Chart" address to the [[Bogleheads® convention meetings#Diehards III - Chicago | Bogleheads reunion]] in 2002 (Morningstar Investment Forum at that time).&lt;ref name="telltale"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In practice, this original 4x25 allocation scheme shifted over time to allow more value tilted allocations, and allocations more closely tied to an individual's risk profile. The [[Talk:Slice and dice | discussion tab (above)]] contains a brief summary of ''slice and dice'' portfolios from several [[:Category:Bogleheads authors |bogleheads authors]], beginning in 1999.

The 4x25 allocation template shows up in some of the "expert" [[Lazy Portfolios | lazy portfolios]]. The following three portfolios all follow the 4x25 pattern, although one shows an increased value tilt.

*[[Lazy portfolios#Bill Schultheis's "Coffeehouse" portfolio | William Schulteis's "Coffeehouse" portfolio]]
*[[Lazy portfolios#William Bernstein's "Coward's" portfolio | William Bernstein's "Coward's" portfolio]] - note: Total Stock Market approximates 10% large, 5% mid/small
*[[Lazy portfolios#Frank Armstrong's "Ideal Index" portfolio | Frank Armstrong's "Ideal Index" portfolio]] - employs a modest value tilt

==Approach==
As mentioned previously, ''slice and dice'' breaks the total stock market into four segments defined as large growth, large value, small growth and small value stocks. Similar to the [[Stock Basics#Style Boxes | equity style boxes]], the vertical segments (large and small) are based on the decile rankings by the Chicago Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP) which breaks down the market into 10 slices containing equal numbers of companies.From &lt;ref group="note" name="crsp"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.crsp.com/products/capbased.html| title=CRSP Cap-Based Portfolio Indices| publisher=CRSP}}:{{dead link}}
# Ranks all NYSE companies by market capitalization and divides them into ten equally populated portfolios.
# Places Amex and NASDAQ stocks into the deciles determined by the NYSE breakpoints, based on market capitalization
# The series of 10 indices are identified as CRSP 1 through CRSP 10, where CRSP 10 has the largest population and smallest market-capitalization.
# CRSP portfolios 1-2 represent large cap stocks, portfolios 3-5 represent mid-caps, portfolios 6-8 represent small caps, and portfolios 9-10 represent micro-caps.
# The portfolios are rebalanced quarterly and total return, capital appreciation return, and income return are calculated on a monthly basis. 

[http://www.crsp.com/crsp/about/history.html About CRSP]:{{dead link}} The Chicago Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP), part of the University of Chicago’s Booth School of Business, maintains a database giving a strong foundation for economic forecasting, stock market research, and financial analyses to academic institutions, investment banks, brokerage firms, corporations, banks, and government agencies. Eighty percent of academic research in stock market and investment analysis uses CRSP data as a source due to the completeness and accuracy of the information.&lt;/ref&gt; To determine whether they are "growth" or "value" (horizontal segments), companies are divided according to their risk or volatility levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ifa.com/articles/Slice_and_Dice_Primer.aspx| title=Slice and Dice Primer| publisher=Index Fund Advisors| date=August 10, 2000| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190117214718/https://www.ifa.com/articles/Slice_and_Dice_Primer/| archive-date=January 17, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Slice and dice'' is based on the approach that small cap stocks and value stocks are associated with risk premiums. Weighting a portfolio in favor of small cap stocks and value stocks increases its volatility and therefore return over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.indexfunds.com/articles/20000403_slice_com_veh_JT.htm| title=In Defense of "Slice and Dice"| author=Jeff Troutner| publisher=Index Funds Advisors| date=2004| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040803114618/http://www.indexfunds.com/articles/20000403_slice_com_veh_JT.htm| archive-date=August 3, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those advocating the ''total stock market'' approach emphasize tax efficiency, simplicity, and the advantages of owning the total market.&lt;ref&gt;{{forum link| p=853494| title=Dreman Criticizes Fama/French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, a "total market" investor might be satisfied with a two-fund portfolio that approximates the entire market; that is, Total Stock Market Index and Total Bond Market Index.

A ''slice and dice'' investor would use more than one stock fund, such as [[Lazy Portfolios#Bill Schultheis's "Coffeehouse" portfolio | William Schulteis's "Coffeehouse portfolio"]], which allocates stocks with six equal "slices": Small-Cap Value Index, REIT Index, Total International Stock Index, Index (S&amp;P) 500, Value Index, and Small-Cap Index.&lt;ref name="nisi" /&gt;

''Slice and dice'' is more complex than a "total market" approach, because ''slice and dice'' portfolios need more attention and more frequent rebalancing than simpler portfolios. The debate boils down to how large the benefit is, whether it is possible to prove unequivocally that there really is a benefit, and, even if so, whether it is worth the effort.&lt;ref name="nisi" /&gt;

==Usage==
The definitions above have evolved over time to include additional asset classes, such as commodities or non-investment-grade [[High yield bonds |("high-yield") bonds]]. The definition of "asset class" is flexible and varies from authority to authority.&lt;ref name="nisi" /&gt;

''Slicing'' is used to divide an asset class or portfolio in one dimension.&lt;ref&gt;{{forum link| p=854113| title=What is "Slice and Dice"?}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*A sliced portfolio: stocks, bonds, cash

''Slice and dice'' divides an asset in two or more dimensions.
*A diced portfolio: stocks (domestic and international); bonds (domestic and foreign); cash ([[CD]]s denominated in US and other currencies).

Stocks are divided into two dimensions in a manner similar to the [[Stock Basics#Style Boxes | equity style boxes]]. The vertical ''slice'' splits the asset into value and growth, the horizontal ''dice'' (second cut) splits the asset into size (market cap).

International stocks can be divided according to regions. For splitting allocations along regional axes see: [[Slice and dice international]]. International stocks can also be ''sliced and diced'' along the four quadrants of the Fama and French three factor model using exchange traded funds. iShares offers developed market funds based on MSCI international indexes with large blend, large value, small blend and small value splits.

On the bond side, investors can ''slice and dice'' a bond portfolio into different "term" and "credit" exposures relative to a total bond index (or hold them in the same percentages, but still hold them separately to better control their allocation to each dimension).&lt;ref group="note"&gt;From email send by member SmallHi.&lt;/ref&gt; (Refer to the [[Bond basics#Style boxes | fixed income style boxes]], which ''slice'' vertically as "credit risk" and ''dice'' horizontally as "term" or duration.)

What ''slice and dice'' is not: if you slice the total world market into pieces and hold each piece in the proportion it represents of the total world market, then you still hold the total world market. There is no tilt and no slice.&lt;ref&gt;{{forum link| p=854188| title=What is "Slice and Dice"?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tilt===
[[Value tilting - stock | Tilting]] is sometimes associated with ''slice and dice'', as both approaches overweight small cap and/or value stocks compared to the total stock market.&lt;ref&gt;{{forum link| p=853682| title=What is "Slice and Dice"?}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, tilting and ''slice and dice'' are completely different concepts.

Tilting does require allocation according to a ''slice and dice'' model. However, tilting alters the allocation across asset classes, while ''slice and dice'' only specifies that the asset classes are managed explicitly and are fixed.

Tilting means a preference for some asset classes or for some factor loading that is different from the total market of a particular asset class, usually US equities.&lt;ref&gt;{{forum link| p=853647| title=What is "Slice and Dice"?}}&lt;/ref&gt; Multifactor (multi-factor) investing uses this approach.

==John Bogle's own view==
[[John Bogle]] gives an interesting, nuanced, and skeptical view in "The Telltale Chart",&lt;ref name="telltale" /&gt; based on a 2002 speech, and included in his 2010 book ''Don't Count On It!'' The main point of the essay is that many popular investment approaches that are often believed to have superior performance, only do so for a while before succumbing to "reversion to the mean" (RTM). His examples include small-cap stocks, value stocks, and "slice and dice" portfolios. (It is commendable that he updated all the charts to 2009 for inclusion in the book, even though many of the assets and portfolios he charts did well recently, undercutting his point).

As an alternative to investing in a foreign total market fund, it is possible to '''slice and dice international''' allocations by holding separate regional funds: [[Emerging market stocks|emerging markets]] plus either a developed markets fund or separate Pacific rim and European funds.

==Characteristics of slice and dice==
The primary advantage of a total market fund is simplicity: a single fund whose market weights are maintained automatically. A secondary benefit for a Vanguard investor is possible inclusion of Canadian stocks, which represent about 6% of Vanguard Total International Index Fund.

Possible advantages and disadvantages of [[Slice and dice |slicing and dicing]] internationally involve costs, taxes, and diversification. 

The relative cost advantage of using [[ETF]]s or [[mutual fund]]s depends on many factors, including size and frequency of the investment, expected holding period, the level of commission and trading costs, and realized return. To determine the relative costs between an ETF and a mutual fund, you can use Vanguard's [https://personal.vanguard.com/us/faces/JSP/Funds/Tools/FundsToolsEtfCostSelectionContent.jsp?etfId=0 cost comparison calculator].

===Currency diversification===
According to [[Rick Ferri]] in ''[[All About Asset Allocation]]'', having fixed allocations between Europe, Pacific, and emerging market diversifies currencies better than one fund.

===Possible rebalancing bonus===
Also according to [[Rick Ferri]], rebalancing across those currencies "could provide a diversification benefit, as it has in the past". [[William Bernstein]] suggests a rebalancing bonus may be obtainable with emerging markets (see [[#External links|External links]] below). Rebalancing in a taxable account may incur capital gains taxes.

===Overweighting pacific or emerging markets===
Historically, Europe has been more correlated with the U.S. market than pacific and emerging markets, so you may want to overweight pacific or emerging markets. The market weight as of January 31, 2010 was approximately 50.1% Europe, 26.2% pacific and 23.7% emerging markets according to the allocation of the [{{Vf | 0113}} Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund], which follows [[Market capitalization | market capitalization]].

===Avoiding regional bubbles===
Total market funds will change as the underlying market weights change. With Japan as an example, maintaining a fixed weight to Japan and Pacific in the 1980s might have avoided an overallocation to Japan. More recently, in 2010 emerging markets increased to 23% of the world market (according to composition of Vanguard Total International Market fund, January 2010), from about 4% in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=John Bogle| author-link=John Bogle| title=Common Sense on Mutual Funds| date=1999| isbn=978-0-471-39228-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is one of the main reasons that Bogleheads favor total market index funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Forum post|p=4107872|title=Re: Playing with Callan's periodic tables of investment returns|author=LadyGeek|date=September 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is patterned after Mendeleev's [[w:periodic table|periodic table]] of the elements, and features well-known, industry-standard market indices as proxies for each asset class.&lt;ref name="Callan"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.callan.com/periodic-table/| title=Periodic Table - Callan| publisher=Callan Institute| accessdate=July 5, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The table shows returns for ten asset classes, ranked from best to worst, with each asset class color-coded for easy tracking. Jay Kloepfer created the table in 1999.&lt;ref name=Callan /&gt;

==Overview==
The chart aims to show the importance of diversification across asset classes ([[stock]]s versus [[bond]]s), investment styles (growth versus value), capitalizations (large versus small) and equity markets (U.S. versus international).

The table is shown below.

The rankings change every year, which demonstrates two key principles of investing:

*Diversification: owning the entire market (all of the asset classes) minimizes susceptibility to changes in market returns.
*Past performance does not predict future performance.

==History and changes==
The composition of the table has changed over the years.

==Putting the table into perspective==
Periodic tables provide a great visual about diversification benefits, but tend to be more qualitative than quantitative. The simple ranking from best to worst does not allow you to easily appreciate the scaling of annual returns.&lt;ref name="siamond"&gt;{{Forum post|p=4107929|title=Re: Playing with Callan's periodic tables of investment returns|author=siamond|date=Sep 07,2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following dispersion graph (distribution spread of returns over time) helps to put such a periodic table in perspective. Notice how the difference between the highest return (blue) and lowest return (red) changes over time.

In addition, it can be difficult to get a sense of returns averaged over a period of time with a periodic table. The following table shows those averages.

One statistic that is sometimes informative is the "[[w:Coefficient of variation|Coefficient of variation]]" (CV), which is simply the standard deviation divided by the mean. This is sometimes called the "coefficient of relative variation." It is the inverse of a signal-to-noise ratio, that is, a noise to signal ratio. The lower the ratio of standard deviation to mean return, the better your risk-return tradeoff.&lt;ref&gt;{{Forum post|p=1596490|title= &lt;nowiki&gt;[Wiki]&lt;/nowiki&gt; Callan periodic table of investment returns|date=Jan 27, 2013|author=Garco}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Treasury securities are backed by the full faith and credit of the US government, and are available in two types: marketable and nonmarketable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.treasurydirect.gov/marketable-securities/| title=About Treasury Marketable Securities| publisher=TreasuryDirect| accessdate=July 5, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt; Treasury security interest income is exempt from state tax. You can buy Treasury securities in an individual or entity account at [https://www.treasurydirect.gov/ TreasuryDirect].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.treasurydirect.gov/marketable-securities/treasury-bonds/| title=Treasury Bonds| publisher=TreasuryDirect| accessdate=July 5, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Government agencies also issue debt, some of which is backed by the full faith and credit of the government, and some of which is not.&lt;/ref&gt; You can also buy marketable Treasury securities in accounts at some banks and brokerages.

You cannot use TreasuryDirect to purchase bonds intended for IRAs.

==Marketable Treasury securities==

There are four types of marketable Treasury securities:&lt;ref name=TD&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.treasurydirect.gov/savings-bonds/| title=Savings Bonds: About| publisher=TreasuryDirect| accessdate=July 5, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Treasury bill]]s, which have maturities ranging from a few days to 52 weeks.
*[[Wikipedia:United States Treasury security#Treasury note |Treasury notes]], which have maturities ranging from one year to ten years.
*[[Treasury bond |Treasury bonds]], which have maturities of greater than ten years. 
*[[Treasury Inflation Protected Securities]] (TIPS), which are securities whose principal is adjusted by changes in the [[consumer price index]]. TIPS pay interest every six months and are issued with maturities of 5, 10, and 30 years.

In addition to being backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government, another benefit of marketable Treasury securities currently being issued is that they are not [[Wikipedia:Callable bond | callable]]. Some older issues available on the secondary market are callable.

See the linked articles for details on each type of marketable Treasury security.

==Nonmarketable Treasury securities==

There are several types of nonmarketable Treasury securities. The types that are of most interest to individual investors are U.S. Savings Bonds, which currently are issued in two series: [[EE savings bonds |Series EE]] and [[I savings bonds |Series I]].&lt;ref name=TD /&gt; See the linked articles for details on each type of savings bond.

The other types of nonmarketable Treasury securities are [[Wikipedia:Zero-Percent Certificate of Indebtedness#Zero-Percent Certificate of Indebtedness |Zero-Percent Certificate of Indebtedness]] and [[Wikipedia:United States Treasury security#Government Account Series |Government Account Series]]. The first of these may be of interest if you have a TreasuryDirect account.

== Role in a portfolio ==

Treasury securities are candidates for the fixed-income part of a portfolio. The primary risks of fixed-income securities are credit risk and interest-rate risk. However, because treasuries are widely considered to have no credit risk, this leaves only interest-rate risk as a primary consideration. Nominal Treasury securities (that is, Treasuries other than TIPS) also have inflation risk, and Treasury securities other than Treasury bills have reinvestment risk.

Because there is no credit risk, you do not need to diversify by holding a large number of Treasury securities. Nevertheless, you can find mutual funds that invest only in treasuries, and some investors use these funds for convenience.

Because of their short-term maturities, Treasury bills have very little interest-rate risk, and so are generally considered the safest type of fixed-income security. Treasury bills also have no reinvestment risk, so the nominal return of a T-Bill held to maturity is certain. See [[Treasury bill]] for more details on the role of T-Bills in a portfolio. FDIC-insured bank accounts and short-term [[Certificate of Deposit | Certificates of Deposit]] (CDs) are similarly safe alternatives for retail investors.

The interest-rate risk, inflation risk, and reinvestment risk of Treasury notes and bonds is proportional to their maturities (that is, longer maturity means higher risk). Most [[:Category:Bogleheads authors |Bogleheads authors]] recommend holding shorter-term fixed-income securities, including Treasuries, typically with maturities no greater than five years.

In conversation, you might hear "take your risk in stocks". This is suggesting moderation in bond investing. The potential reward for taking on risk with newly issued bonds held to maturity is limited by the coupon rate, whereas with stocks the investor shares fully in the up-side when risks are rewarded.

Some authors recommend holding longer-term nominal Treasury securities, especially if the investor has a high allocation to equities. A recent paper co-authored by [[Larry Swedroe]] presented evidence that this was an effective strategy. David Swensen advocates the use of long-term Treasuries held in small amounts as the perfect diversifier for equities; see: {{forum link| t=2409| title=Diversifying Power of Longer Term US Treasuries| date=May 9, 2007}}. Also, see [[Treasury bond]] for more on the role of longer-term Treasury bonds in a portfolio.

Others advocate including other types of bonds in the bond portion of the portfolio, giving higher yield and higher ''expected'' total return, but also higher credit risk. Advocates of this approach, including the ''[[Bogleheads' Guide To Investing]]'' authors, often include [[Mortgage-backed security | mortgage-backed securities]] (MBS) and [[Corporate bonds| corporate bonds]]. The popular Vanguard Total Bond Market Index fund holds corporate bonds and MBS as well as Treasury securities.

A common recommendation for the fixed-income portion of the portfolio is to hold some nominal bonds, including Treasury securities, and some real return bonds such as TIPS. Larry Swedroe suggests primarily holding TIPS and short-term nominal Treasury securities as the fixed-income portion of a portfolio. Maturities of TIPS can be extended because of the inflation protection feature. See [[Treasury Inflation Protected Security]] for more on the role of TIPS in a portfolio. 

Bogleheads author and investment manager [[Rick Ferri]] advocates the inclusion of a small portion of [[High yield bonds |high-yield bonds]] as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.rickferri.com/blog/investments/total-bond-index-funds-are-not-the-total-bond-market/| title=Total Bond Index Funds are Not the Total Bond Market| author=Rick Ferri| author-link=Rick Ferri| date=October 24, 2011| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141228234706/https://rickferri.com/blog/investments/total-bond-index-funds-are-not-the-total-bond-market/| archive-date=December 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Be sure to understand the rationale for, and the risks of, such a strategy before adopting it, because higher yield almost always comes with higher risk.

      <text bytes="33430" sha1="ppvr6cxnh715fau4pema6ureupfefs7" xml:space="preserve">The [[#Major Factors | major factors]]  in deciding between owning a bond fund versus individual bonds are: [[#Diversification | diversification]], [[#Convenience | convenience]], [[#Costs | costs]], and [[#Control over maturity | control over maturity]].  There is a common belief (promoted by Suze Orman, among others) that [[#Why Thinking of a Rolling Ladder's Return as "Safe" is Misleading | owning individual bonds is less risky]] than a bond fund, but this is not necessarily true if an appropriate bond fund or collection of funds is chosen. [[#Duration | Duration]] is an essential concept for understanding the riskiness of a fund or ladder over time.  There's also an important distinction between owning individual bonds (declining duration) and holding a rolling bond ladder. Rolling bond ladders are a constant duration investment, whereas an individual bond's duration decreases as it approaches maturity.

== Declining versus constant duration ==

=== Methods of achieving declining versus constant duration ===

What kinds of financial instruments produce a declining duration?
* An individual bond, with coupons reinvested in some form that is liquid on the bond's date of maturity (e.g. a bank account, bonds with shorter and shorter maturities as described above, or CDs with put options)
* A [[Zero-coupon bond]], which doesn't pay out a coupon so that no reinvesting of coupons is required.
* A portfolio of individual bonds, purchased with shorter and shorter maturities. A.k.a. a [[#Rolling versus Non-Rolling Bond Ladders | non-rolling bond ladder]]
* A target-date bond fund.  These are rare funds and tend to have very high expense ratios.  We will therefore not consider them further.

What kinds of financial instruments produce a constant duration?
* A portfolio of individual bonds, set up such that when one bond matures another bond of equal maturity is purchased.  A.k.a. a [[#Rolling versus Non-Rolling Bond Ladders | rolling bond ladder]].
* A bond fund, where a manager maintains the portfolio to have a fairly constant duration.

=== Reasons for choosing declining or constant duration ===

Assuming the complexities and expenses associated with each were about the same...

Why would you choose a declining duration portfolio/fund?
* You have a known expense at a future date that you want to set money aside for.  Examples include saving for a car, or for some investors, college.

Why would you choose a constant duration portfolio/fund?
* You are saving for expenses with unknown amounts and/or unknown time horizons.  Examples include retirement, saving for a house down payment, or for some investors, college.

== A framework for comparing portfolios of individual bonds to bond funds ==

* Many, if not most, Bogleheads and other investors use bonds as part of a larger portfolio because of their stabilizing properties on the whole portfolio (in this context, the proper framework for analysis is its historical long-term returns as an asset class, its risks, and its relation to the rest of the portfolio).  
* What matters is total return, not the return of any one component such as the principal which is often focused on in isolation.  Total return has three components:
** Principal
** Interest (coupon payments)
** Interest-on-interest (reinvested coupon payments)
* We will discuss what happens to the fund or bond after a single interest-rate change.  However, as long as the duration of the portfolio is kept approximately equal to the remaining time horizon, then this single interest rate change generalizes to all interest rate changes.  For instance, suppose a portfolio of bonds or funds is purchased with 5-year duration to meet a goal 5 years in the future, and is properly rebalanced to keep the duration equal to the investment horizon.  With 4 years remaining, a parallel shift of the yield curve occurs&lt;ref&gt;Refer to [[:Bonds: Advanced Topics#References | Bonds: Advanced Topics, References]] for a definition of yield curve shift&lt;/ref&gt;.  The investor would be indifferent to that interest rate change because of duration matching.  If six months later interest rates change again, the investor similarly does not care, because their duration is now 3.5 years and so they are similarly indifferent.
** This makes clear a key fact often omitted in the financial advice literature.  The recommendation to "keep your duration equal to your need for the money" cannot be applied once and forgotten, but must be updated continuously (or more realistically, by rebalancing every 3-12 months into shorter-term funds).  The only way to achieve duration matching automatically is to purchase a zero-coupon bond.  Neither individual bonds nor funds will do this perfectly, although individual bonds come closer (particularly in low-interest rate environments).  
** Note that the scenario of rebalancing bond funds or portfolios of individual bonds to meet a known, fixed, future obligation is a bit silly.  If you have such an obligation, the safest course of action is to purchase neither a fund nor an individual coupon-paying bond, but instead to purchase a zero-coupon bond maturing on the date needed.  Nevertheless, it illustrates the point that your money is safe, as will be elaborated in the rest of this page.

=== Rolling versus non-rolling bond ladders ===

If you need to satisfy date-certain future liabilities, a non-rolling ladder of individual bonds is superior to a bond fund.  For example, if you commit to make a $10,000 a year payment to a charity for five years, the most effective way to invest for that is to buy 5 zero-coupon bonds, one maturing each year.  A non-rolling bond ladder matches cash flows to liabilities, which immunizes a portfolio against interest rate shifts.

However, most bond ladders are "rolling", because they are not designed to deal with date-certain future liabilities.  They are created with a specific average duration, and when the oldest bond comes due, a new long-dated bond is purchased to replace it.  A rolling ladder of this kind can and should be directly compared with a bond fund using the [[#Major Factors | criteria]] below.  According to Vanguard in their [[Individual_Bonds_vs_a_Bond_Fund#Links | paper]] ''Taxable bond investing: Bond funds or individual bonds?'', "The total return of a laddered account with characteristics identical to those of an open-end bond fund will deviate from the fund’s return only by the transaction and operational cost differentials."

As advocated by [[Zvi Bodie]], some people aim to fund their retirement by purchasing a ladder of individual TIPS with durations of 1 to 30 years.  The idea is to avoid the volatility of the underlying bonds by always holding them to maturity, so as to avoid having to sell the fund at moments when high yields have caused the NAV to drop.

If you are planning to reinvest (i.e, rollover) some of the annual redemption into new individual TIPS bonds, then you have gained nothing by using a rolling ladder over a fund. Because not rolling over the whole bond at the (hypothetically) very high yield has an identical opportunity cost to selling a portion of your fund at the (hypothetically) very low NAV. Another issue with this approach is how to deal with the longevity risk if you outlive your ladder.

Thus, the distinction between a non-rolling ladder (designed to meet date-certain future liabilities) and a rolling ladder (which essentially represents a personal bond fund) is much more important than the difference between a rolling ladder and a bond fund.

== Rolling ladders and funds are similar ==

It has been regularly argued on the [http://www.bogleheads.org Bogleheads forum] that a bond fund is risky because of [[NAV]] fluctuations. For example, the [[NAV]] for [{{Vf | 0119}} Vanguard Inflation Protected Securities] fell 20.4% from peak to trough in 2008.  Instead, it is said, investors should hold individual bonds, which can always be redeemed at face value by holding until maturity. However, the value of individual bonds held in a personal portfolio fluctuates just as the NAV of a bond fund fluctuates. You can see this by looking at the daily price changes of individual bonds online at [http://fixedincome.fidelity.com/fi/FISearchIndividualBonds Fidelity's fixed income site]. Bond prices can also be obtained online through [https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/bonds/bonddesk Vanguard's Bond Desk]. The daily fluctuation of the price of an individual bond will be similar to a bond fund ''if their duration is the same''.

== Non-rolling ladders versus funds ==

A non-rolling ladder (or a single bond) will behave differently than a bond fund over time. This is because a bond fund (usually) maintains a relatively constant duration. On the other hand, a non-rolling ladder has a duration that decreases over time. If you want to obtain the behavior of a non-rolling ladder using bond funds you must decrease the duration of the bond fund over time. This is done by mixing two funds so that their weighted average duration is the same as the ladder which you are trying to mimic. In some cases it may not be possible to find a fund with the duration that you want. For example, Vanguard only offers one TIPS fund so you will need to buy individual TIPS to achieve the duration that you are looking for.

== Duration ==

It's useful to focus on the [[:Bonds: Advanced Topics#Duration | duration]] of your bond fund, such as the Vanguard TIPS Fund, which currently has a duration of [{{Vf | 0119}} 5.0 years].  [[William Bernstein]] provides an insightful [http://www.efficientfrontier.com/ef/999/duration.htm definition of duration] as the "point of indifference" for the owner of a bond fund in dealing with interest rate changes.  If interest rates rise after purchasing a bond fund, the NAV of the fund falls, which hurts the investor.  However, the dividends that the bond fund throws off can now be reinvested at a higher rate.  The duration is the length of time that an investor needs to hold the fund for the increased yields to compensate for the decrease in NAV.  In that sense, duration represents the length of time it would take for the total value of the fund, with dividends reinvested, to be worth exactly what it would have been worth had interest rates not risen.  So, you should always hold bond funds with a duration equal to or shorter than the expected need for your money (note that holding the duration shorter than your need for the money leaves you exposed to the risk of lower returns if interest rates fall).

Of course, as discussed above, this definition of duration applies equally to bond funds and to an individual portfolio of bonds.  The relationship does not exactly hold if the [[Bonds:_Advanced_Topics#Yield_Curves | yield curve]] shifts in a non-parallel fashion, but the difference is expected to be small.

Interest rates change continuously, not just at a single point in time.  Therefore, as the time when you will need the money approaches, you must reduce your duration accordingly, to protect you against any further increases in prevailing rates.  The ways in which this can be done are discussed below.

=== Why thinking of a rolling ladder's return as "safe" is misleading ===

The common argument for individual bonds over a fund is that at maturity you are guaranteed to get your principal back.  While this is true, the principal is only one of the three sources of return for a bond:
# Principal
# Interest (coupon payments)
# Interest-on-interest (reinvested coupon payments)

According to [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_J._Fabozzi Fabozzi] in the ''Handbook of Fixed Income Securities'', 1991, p97:
"In high interest rate environments, the interest-on-interest component for long-term bonds may be as high as 70 percent of the bond's potential total dollar return."

Therefore, focusing on the principal as "safe" misses the point, since it is in many circumstances the smallest component of a bond's return.  If you are saving for a large goal, you therefore have to invest considerably more into the bond than you want guaranteed to ensure the need is met by the principal. 

To make sure the total value (all three components listed above) winds up being what you expected it to be, you should maintain a portfolio duration equal to your investment horizon and continually reduce the duration as your investment horizon nears (or more realistically, rebalance every 3-12 months, which Michael Granito in ''Bond Portfolio Immunization'' claims didn't cause any substantial deviations from target return vs. continuous rebalancing in a variety of simulated market conditions).  A zero-coupon bond does this automatically.  A coupon-paying bond does not (duration declines very slowly at first and then more rapidly once the bond nears its maturity; this is more pronounced in high-rate environments and less important in low-rate periods), nor does a bond fund (duration is relatively constant).   Stated differently, since the duration of a coupon-paying bond is less than its maturity, if you invest such that the bond matures when you need the money, you are by definition not investing such that the duration is equal to your investment horizon, leaving you vulnerable to interest rate declines.

In another text (''Fixed Income Mathematics'', 1993, p175), Fabozzi summarizes, "Therefore, investing in a coupon bond with a yield to maturity equal to the target yield and a maturity equal to the investment horizon does not assure that the target accumulated value will be achieved."

=== Zero-coupon example ===

If you have a sudden need to extract the principal from a bond fund (or portfolio of individually-held bonds, for that matter), you can do so as rapidly as possible by selling the fund and buying a [[zero-coupon bond]] with the face value of your principal. Such a bond will always be available, because if the fund's NAV is down, yields will have gone up a commensurate amount.  On average (with a typical yield curve), the bond will have a maturity equal to the duration of the TIPS fund.  (A regular TIPS bond would also serve the same purpose, but a zero coupon bond makes the calculation simpler, because the duration equals the maturity.)

The strategy of buying a zero-coupon bond works because the duration of a zero equals the maturity, and therefore declines steadily as time passes.  No other commonly-available type of bond instrument has this property (although it can be replicated with bond funds or with individual bonds, provided you rebalance regularly).  Therefore, if you have a fixed, known obligation at some future point in time, a zero-coupon bond is the obvious choice to satisfy it.

''For example:'' Fred buys a bond fund while Larry buys bond ladder, each with equal duration. Interest rates skyrocket just afterward. At that moment, Fred and Larry have an equal loss. Fred can log into Vanguard and see that his fund balance is, say, 70% of what he invested. Larry can log into Vanguard Brokerage Services and see that the total value of all of the bonds in his ladder are 70% of what he invested. Whether either decides to realize the loss or not, the loss has in fact occurred.

Now, the only difference between Fred and Larry is that Larry has two options for getting his money back and Fred has one.  Fred can sell his bond fund and buy a [[Zero-coupon bond|zero coupon bond]] with a maturity value equal to his initial capital investment.  Larry can likewise sell his bond ladder and buy a zero coupon bond.  Larry's additional option is to hold all of his bonds until maturity. However, this second option is unambiguously worse for Larry. He would need to hold his longest bonds twice as long as the zero coupon bond to get his money back. Due to the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost opportunity cost] of having his money unnecessarily locked up, this means he would actually be losing money versus the zero coupon option. In addition, for taxable accounts, selling their holdings to buy zero coupon bonds would let Larry and Fred take advantage of [[tax loss harvesting]].

Please note that this whole example is artificial, because it is extremely rare for a bond holder to decide that he needs to immediately liquidate all of his principal.  Instead, bond holders are generally interested in steady growth over the long term.  Some people suffered 15 or 20% losses in their bond holdings (both fund and ladders) in late 2008.  Very few sold their holdings to buy zero coupon bonds.  Instead, they continued making periodic contributions like they always do, ignoring the balance of the fund.  And this was certainly the right choice, as the funds have regained their previous value.

The whole argument for individual bonds being less risky is based on this completely artificial concept that you will one day decide you need all of your money back, and then happily wait 20 years to get it back (all in nominal terms, meaning the money has been eaten away by inflation in the meantime).  The point of using zero coupon bonds is that they are an equally arbitrary option.  But they show that Fred is never worse off than Larry: a bond fund is no riskier than a bond ladder.

In real life, people should hold bond funds (high grade, short or intermediate term, and a mix of nominal and inflation-adjusted), and just ignore the NAV.  All that matters is total return, and if you hold the fund longer than the duration, your total return will be just fine.  The zero coupon example is just an academic way of making that point.

== Convexity ==

Positive convexity, a characteristic possessed by bonds without options, is ignored in the above discussion but only strengthens the argument, since positive convexity lengthens duration when rates fall and shortens duration when rates rise.  The [[Bonds:_Advanced_Topics#Convexity|Advanced Bonds section]] contains more detail.

== Yield curve changes ==

Changes in the shape of the [[Bonds:_Advanced_Topics#Yield_Curves|yield curve]] may make a difference in the above comparison, but the effect is expected to be minor for a long term investment.

== Major factors ==

=== Diversification ===

Diversification is important for bonds, as it is for all asset classes. The argument against an investor ever owning individual [[Corporate bonds |corporate]] or [[Municipal Bonds |municipal bonds]] (even in a ladder) is that the effect of a single default (such as a corporation or city brought down by fraud), even if unlikely, could be devastating to the investor's portfolio. By contrast, bond funds allow extremely broad diversification at a very low cost.

A ladder of individual bonds generally includes between 10 and a couple dozen bonds.  That means that each bond represents 2.5% to 10% of a portfolio.  By contrast [{{Vf | 0084}} Total Bond] owns [{{Vf | 0084}} 3855 different bonds], and [{{Vf | 0042}} Intermediate Term Tax Exempt] owns [{{Vf | 0042}} 1971].  So, the failure (default) of any one bond has a minuscule effect on the fund.

The only exceptions are Treasury bonds (including [[TIPS]]). Because all Treasury bonds are explicitly backed by the US government, they have the highest possible credit rating. They also all have the same issuer. There is no diversification benefit from owning a Treasury bond fund instead of individual Treasury bonds.

=== Convenience ===

Investors in a bond fund can buy or sell additional shares at any time in any quantity. There is usually no transaction fee for buying or selling additional shares. With individual bonds, purchases on the primary market may only be made on the pre-set issuer schedule (e.g., every few months for TIPS). Purchases on the secondary market are generally subject to a commission and one always pays a [[bid/ask spread]], which can be substantial.  Also, individual bond purchases are only available in increments of $1,000 (and more often $5,000 or $10,000).

Bond funds offer automatic dividend reinvestment.  While you are in your accumulation phase, it is far more convenient to have dividends automatically reinvested.  Even after beginning to spend your holdings, it is generally simpler to have bond funds automatically reinvest dividends and then just sell a fixed amount of the fund monthly or quarterly.  By contrast, there is no simple way to reinvest small amounts into individual bonds.  It is also far more convenient to [[Rebalancing |rebalance]] between a bond fund and other assets in your portfolio.

Taxes are simpler for bond funds.  If you invest in a bond fund in a taxable account, you receive tax forms from the bond fund company. If you have a portfolio of individual bonds, you receive tax forms from TreasuryDirect or your brokerage account listing the tax-related items for each bond. It's easier to figure out the tax reporting for one bond fund versus many individual bonds.  Also, owners of individual TIPS owe a tax on [[TIPS#Tax_Considerations | phantom income]] that they do not receive.  This is not an issue with TIPS funds.

On the other hand, for investors who are accustomed to managing a portfolio of individual bonds, a rolling bond ladder can be fairly simple to manage and can be simpler to understand conceptually.  This is made somewhat more complicated when individual issues are discontinued, leaving a hole in the bond ladder.  For instance, there were no 20-year Treasuries issued from 1986-1993.  The solution is either to find equivalent combinations of bonds which keep the overall duration the same (in a 6% interest rate environment, to replace the 20-year you could use 36% 10-year and 64% 30-year bonds), or to buy a longer issue from which some time has elapsed on the secondary market (e.g. buy a 30-year bond issued 10 years ago) and bear the cost of the poor spread individuals receive when buying bonds in small lots.

=== Costs ===

The costs associated with owning bonds are commissions, [[bid/ask spread]]s, and management fees.  Primary purchases of bonds (such as at a TIPS auction) generally do not incur commissions or bid/ask spreads.  Purchases and sales on a secondary market can have substantial commissions and bid/ask spreads, particularly on less liquid bonds like [http://moneywatch.bnet.com/investing/blog/irrational-investor/municipal-bonds-and-the-industrys-dirty-little-secret/1621/ municipals] and corporates.  Spreads also tend to be wider for the smaller value transactions that individual investors make&lt;ref&gt;"The bid side will widen as the trade size gets
smaller (unlike that for stocks)." [http://moneywatch.bnet.com/investing/blog/wise-investing/the-truth-about-municipal-bond-costs/1502/?tag=col1;blog-river -Larry Swedroe]&lt;/ref&gt;.  With the exception of primary purchases of Treasury bonds and TIPS, bond funds pay much lower bid/ask spreads on their bond transactions, giving them a significant cost advantage over regular investors purchasing individual bonds.  Even for Treasuries bought at auction, the cost discrepancy is not clear-cut; off-the-run Treasuries generally pay higher yields than new issues of the same effective maturity, mitigating much of the advantage of buying new issues with no spread.  Swedroe points out (see [http://moneywatch.bnet.com/investing/blog/wise-investing/ginnie-maes-effect-on-portfolios/1229/#comments comment 20]) that the same phenomenon exists in the municipal bond market as well.

There is no management fee for holding a portfolio of individual bonds.  However, there is an opportunity cost associated with the time to do so.  If you enjoy purchasing TIPS in auction, than this time is really a consumption item rather than an expense.  If tracking auction dates and the shape of the yield curve doesn't seem like fun, than it should be treated as a real cost.  For example, holding $100,000 of VAIPX (Vanguard [{{Vf | 5119}} Inflation-Protected Securities Fund Admiral]) costs $110 per year (with an expense ratio of 0.11%).  If you value your time at $55 an hour, it is more cost effective to use this fund than hold your own portfolio of bonds if it takes you more than 2 hours a year to manage your portfolio.

=== Control over maturity and other bond characteristics ===

==== Control over maturity ====

By managing your own portfolio of bonds, you can either pick the average duration you want or "ride" the [[Bonds: Advanced Topics#Yield Curves | yield curve]] to pick up bonds that are "cheap" compared to the [[Laddering Bonds or CDs | ladder]] overall, and allow your [[Bonds: Advanced Topics#Duration|duration]] to fluctuate with your purchases.  In either case, you are in control.  With a bond fund, the duration is designed not to move more than a year or two and is managed by the fund.

However, investors need to consider who is in the best position to find bonds that are slightly under-priced, you or a dozen expert bond analysts at a fund company whose only job it is to follow the bond market? 

Also, if you'd like a shorter duration than offered by a bond fund, it is easy to shorten it by putting a portion of the money in a [[Money Markets | money market fund]].  For example, the Vanguard municipal bond fund for New York has an average maturity of [{{Vf | 0076}} 11.1 years].  You can approximately halve that by holding half of your money in that fund and half in the [{{Vf | 0163}} New York Tax Exempt Money Market].  Depending on the shape of the yield curve (concave vs. convex), this may cost you return. 

==== Control over convexity ====

While it is relatively easy to calculate the [[Bonds:_Advanced_Topics#Convexity | convexity]] of a portfolio of individual bonds, most bond funds ([http://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=655486&amp;sid=714d3b8675acf919898c29db3a8d4fe9 including Vanguard]) do not make the convexity of their funds available.  This opens the door for manager risk (where unscrupulous managers can "juice" their yield by buying bonds with lower convexity--investors will never know until it is too late).  However, while investors in a portfolio of individual bonds can calculate the convexity, few do, in part because taking advantage of this generally requires purchasing on the secondary market, which is expensive for small portfolios.  Therefore the real-world application of this difference may be limited.

==== Control over inflation factor ====

There is an additional factor to consider for [[Treasury_Inflation_Protected_Securities|TIPS]], in that buying individual issues gives you control over the "inflation factor" (also known as the "index ratio").  This allows you to manage deflation risk (generally at some premium which reflects the market's expectation of deflation).

==== Control over tax-efficient characteristics ====

Some managers may choose to purchase AMT bonds to increase yield, which disadvantages investors subject to this tax.  This is easily avoided by researching the fund's holdings.

==== Control over call risk ====

Managers may also choose to purchase bonds with higher call risk to boost the fund's yield, which disadvantages investors if the risk shows up at the wrong time or if they are not planning for this risk in their overall portfolio.  Careful research into long-term track records and holdings of funds will mitigate this problem.

==== Control over liquidity ====

Bond funds have to meet redemptions at any time.  They may handle this in at least two ways: by holding cash reserves or by investing in more liquid bonds (e.g. on-the-run Treasuries vs. off-the-run Treasuries).  Both approaches earn lower yields on the proportion of the fund held as liquidity reserves.

==== Availability of other fixed income types ====

CDs are not available in a bond fund. Often, CDs yield more than the equivalently risk-free Treasury of similar duration.

=== Manager risk and opacity === 

Bond funds should be selected carefully.  The experience of Schwab YieldPlus Investor [http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=swypx&amp;d=t (SWYPX)] demonstrates this risk--an UltraShort bond fund that was billed as a safe alternative to money market funds lost over 50% of its NAV.  Read the prospectus carefully for indications such as the use of complicated derivatives (options, futures, options on futures, swaps), leverage, short sales, junk bonds, foreign and emerging market bonds, convertible securities, mortgage dollar rolls, etc.  YieldPlus used all of these.  While it is possible to use these tools to reduce risk, it is also possible to greatly magnify the risk in exchange for only small gains in yield.  The rise of bond index funds holds the possibility of eliminating manager risk entirely, leaving only the much smaller risk of tracking error.

=== Tax-loss harvesting ===

Larry Swedroe [http://moneywatch.bnet.com/investing/blog/irrational-investor/bonds-or-bond-funds-an-easy-choice/873/?tag=col1;blog-river makes the interesting point] that holding a portfolio of individual bonds lets you [[Tax_loss_harvesting | tax-loss harvest]] at the single-bond level; with a fund you can only TLH when a whole fund incurs a loss.  The magnitude of this benefit is unclear and will depend on the investor's tax bracket.  Since bid-ask spreads tend to be large on the secondary market (particularly for non-Treasuries), this strategy is not viable for most individual investors.  Moreover, since Boglehead strategy is to [[Principles_of_Tax-Efficient_Fund_Placement | place bonds in tax-advantaged spaces whenever possible]], the ability to TLH is likely quite limited for most smaller investors (as he himself points out, "For typical smaller investor bond funds are the ONLY way to go.").  For larger portfolios involving Treasuries in taxable accounts, Mr. Swedroe's insight may tip the balance in favor of holding individual bonds.

== When to hold a rolling ladder or fund ==

As explained earlier, the value of a rolling bond ladder reacts the same to market changes as the NAV of a bond fund if their holdings are the same so daily price fluctuations should not be a consideration. However, there are other factors to consider when choosing between a bond fund and a rolling ladder of individual issues, as detailed below.  The principal tradeoff for a long-term investor is the diversification of bond funds and the low trading costs vs. the expense ratio of the fund.

For bond categories with high credit risk such as [[Corporate bonds|corporate bonds]], [[High yield bonds|high yield bonds]], or [[Emerging market bonds| emerging market bonds]], bond funds are the clear choice because the diversification benefit clearly exceeds the expense ratio.  For [[Municipal bonds|municipal bonds]] the picture is less clear, as default rates are quite low; nevertheless for small-to-medium-sized portfolios ([http://moneywatch.bnet.com/investing/blog/irrational-investor/bonds-or-bond-funds-an-easy-choice/873/?tag=col1;blog-river Swedroe suggests $500k minimum portfolio size whereas Alan Roth suggests $50m]) the diversification benefit still argues for a fund, as does the liquidity premium (bid/ask spreads are quite high for munis).

For [[Treasury bonds| treasury bonds]] (including [[Treasury_Inflation_Protected_Securities | TIPS]]), which are assumed to lack any credit risk, the diversification of a fund adds little benefit over a rolling bond ladder.  Therefore the expense ratio is merely a convenience fee (or perhaps a small liquidity premium).  For a low-cost Treasury fund, however, that fee may be reasonable and is a matter of personal preference.  If you are not interested in the greater liquidity and lower demands on investor time of a fund, the best way of investing in Treasuries is to purchase individual bonds at auction (which is generally free), assuming the spread over equivalent off-the-run issues is not too large.  This is particularly true if the investor is considering [[CDs_vs_Bonds | CDs as a substitute for treasuries]], as they often yield more and are unavailable in fund form.

{{Warning|Adjusting your asset allocation based on taxation may have significant unintended consequences. Tax rates change, tax brackets change, or your tax preferences may change. What was a logical tax location one year may turn out to be a poor choice a few years later. Consider the implications carefully.}}

If you have accounts with different tax treatment (taxable, [[IRA | traditional IRA]] or [[401(k)]], [[Roth IRA]] or 401(k)), equal dollar amounts in those accounts have different after-tax values.  Therefore, if you want to optimize the after-tax value of your portfolio, you should base your [[asset allocation]] on the after-tax value of the accounts.

==Why to adjust==
The purpose of asset allocation is to design a portfolio with the desired level of expected [[Risk and return: an introduction|return and risk]].  Returns and mathematical definitions of risk should be based on after-tax values, since the after-tax value is what you will be able to spend.  Emotional definitions of risk should be based on how you perceive the risk.

===Returns===
The goal of returns is to get the money you will spend to achieve your goal.  If you have $100K in stock in a Roth and the stock market doubles in value, you have $100K more to spend in retirement.  If you have $100K in stock in a traditional IRA, you have $100K more pre-tax but will lose some of the value to taxes upon withdrawal.  If you have $100K in stock in a taxable account, the account will be worth less than $200K after the stock market doubles in value, because of taxes on dividends, and you will have even less to spend because you will pay tax on your capital gains.

===Mathematical risk===
Mathematical risk is based on your need and ability to take risk.  Your need to take risk is determined by the returns you require; if you need your portfolio to double in order to provide an adequate standard of living, you actually need it to double in after-tax value.  Your ability to take risk is determined by the consequences of losses; losing $100K in your Roth IRA will reduce your standard of living (or require more additional savings to keep the same standard) by more than losing $100K in your traditional IRA or taxable account does.

===Emotional risk===
Emotional risk is determined by how you will react to losses.  If you pull out of the stock market after it falls, or you cannot sleep during a bear market, then your portfolio is too risky.  In theory, the best way to handle emotional risk is the same as any other risk; if your portfolio software is set up to only present the after-tax value of your portfolio, then a $100K loss in an account taxed at 24% is only a $76K decrease in your bottom line.  In practice, most investors will not be able to make these adjustments, particularly because the investment statements show dollar values.

==How much to adjust==
There are two reasonable formulas for adjustment, based on the marginal and overall tax rates.  The marginal rate is the correct rate to use for considering changes in the asset allocation (and thus for most tax-adjusted asset allocation), while the overall rate is correct for estimating the portfolio value or expected returns.

===Adjusting by the marginal rate=== 
You should value your Roth at its full value, and reduce the value of your traditional IRA or 401(k) by your expected tax bracket at retirement (including state taxes if your state taxes these withdrawals, which varies by state).  You should also reduce the value of your taxable account by a smaller percent, to account for future capital gains and dividend taxes; estimated values are necessary because the tax cost depends on how much you will have in actual capital gains.

If all of your IRA or 401(k) withdrawals will be in a 24% marginal rate when you retire, then 24% of your withdrawals from a traditional IRA or 401(k) will be lost to taxes.  Therefore, it makes sense to assume that the IRS owns 24% of the account; whatever the gain or loss in nominal dollars, 76% will go to you and 24% to the IRS.  In contrast, the IRS owns none of your Roth, which is tax-free.

If your IRA or 401(k) is large enough that the withdrawals will span multiple tax brackets each year, the marginal tax rate is the rate which affects the risk and return of any marginal decisions you might make, such as a change in your asset allocation.  For example, if you expect that half your withdrawals will be taxed at 12% and half at 22%, you will lose only 17% of the total to taxes.  However, if you increase the risk of your IRA investments and earn an extra $1,000, you will pay an extra $220 in taxes, not $170; if the risk works out badly and you lose $1,000, you will pay $220 less in taxes.  Thus, in this situation, the IRS owns 22% of the part of the IRA in which your decision will make a difference.

The IRS also owns part of your taxable account, representing the difference between what you earn on it and what you could have earned in a tax-free account.  If your taxable account is invested in stocks, you will lose some money every year you hold it to the tax on the dividends, and more to the capital gains tax when you sell.  If it is invested in municipal bonds, you effectively lose the difference between yields on municipal bonds and corporate bonds of comparable risk every year.  The calculation is more complicated (and depends on assumptions about future returns and tax rates), but the adjustment usually comes out about the same for a taxable account and an IRA; [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1E28C1YTb1jzi3hSKK3ABGvWgTmjSlO5W/edit?usp=sharing&amp;ouid=103809420707053067543&amp;rtpof=true&amp;sd=true this spreadsheet] can make an estimated calculation.  The spreadsheet calculates the marginal tax rate, for the same reason as above.

===Adjusting for the overall tax rate===
The overall tax rate, averaged over all your withdrawals, determines the actual after-tax value of your accounts, and thus affects the after-tax returns.  A 401(k) or traditional IRA loses less to tax adjustment from the overall tax rate; a taxable account loses about the same amount because its taxes are at a mostly-flat rate on capital gains and qualified dividends.

A natural assumption for the overall tax rate is that you will have some taxable income independent of your retirement accounts (such as 85% of [[Social Security]], which is taxable for higher-income retirees), and your IRA or 401(k) will be taxed on top of that.  Estimate your other income and deductions, and then compute the tax on the difference between that income and the retirement accounts.  This will be somewhat less than your marginal tax rate if your IRA or 401(k) spans multiple brackets.

If you have a taxable account, you will probably still need to adjust based on your marginal tax rate, because the tax on qualified dividends and long-term gains is effectively a flat 15% (plus state tax) in most tax brackets.  If your total taxable income in retirement is in a 15% tax bracket, you will not owe any federal tax on qualified dividends and capital gains in retirement.  If you hold munis, the tax cost is unaffected by your retirement tax bracket, since it is an effective cost equal to the difference between taxable and tax-exempt bonds of comparable risk.

==Why to make these adjustments==
It is easiest to see why the adjustment is necessary by comparing traditional and Roth accounts.  For example, suppose you have $4,000 in a 401(k) and $3,000 in a Roth IRA, and you will be in a hypothetical (for simplicity) 25% marginal rate when you retire.  You might choose to invest the entire 401(k) in stock and the entire Roth in bonds.  If you do this, and the stock market gains 10% while the bond market gains 5%, your 401(k) would be worth $4,400, and your Roth would be worth $3,150.  The IRS will take 25% of your 401(k) when you withdraw it, so you could now withdraw your investments for $6,450.  Similarly, if you invested the 401(k) in bonds and the Roth in stock, your 401(k) would be worth $4,200, and your Roth would be worth $3,300.  After taxes, you would have the same $6,450.  Since both portfolios give you the same 7.5% return that you would expect from a portfolio which was 50% stock and 50% bonds, it is reasonable to treat both portfolios as having a 50/50 asset allocation, rather than the 57/43 and 43/57 which would result from the nominal values.

The tax adjustment also adjusts for the effective difference in risk between the two accounts.  In the example above, suppose that the stock market loses half its value.  If your 401(k) was entirely in stock, it would drop from $4,000 to $2,000, which would cost you $1,500 in after-tax value; if your Roth was entirely in stock, it would drop from $3,000 to $1,500.  Either way, you lose 25% of the value of your portfolio, so your portfolio has the risk of a portfolio which is 50% stock.

==Consequences==
===Asset location===
Once you adjust for the after-tax value, it does not matter which assets you put in a traditional IRA or 401(k) and which you put in a Roth.  If you are in a hypothetical 25% marginal tax rate range, investing $4,000 in the 401(k) or $3,000 in the Roth in the same investment will give you the same after-tax value.

If all else is equal (and it often isn't because of limited 401(k) options), it is slightly better to put assets with higher expected returns in the Roth.  If your traditional account has lower than expected returns and you fall into a lower tax bracket, the IRS will not give back the same share of the losses; if your traditional account has higher than expected returns, the IRS will take a larger share of the gains.  In the Roth, you get the same percentage (100%) of all gains and losses.  In addition, the Roth is protected against potential changes in tax rates, has more flexible rules for [[Required Minimum Distribution vs annuitization | required minimum distributions]], and is not counted as income for making Social Security taxable.

It still does matter which assets you put in your taxable accounts; see [[Tax-efficient fund placement]] for details.

===Roth conversions===
You can evaluate a conversion of a traditional IRA to a Roth by its effect on your after-tax asset allocation.  If you are in the same tax bracket now that you expect to be in at retirement, and you pay taxes on the conversion with IRA money (or with money you would have otherwise contributed to a 401(k) or IRA), the conversion is break-even.  For example, if you are at a hypothetical 25% tax marginal rate and convert a $40,000 IRA, you will have $30,000 in the Roth after paying taxes.  Previously, you owned $30,000 of the IRA and the IRS owned the other $10,000; after conversion, you own the entire $30,000 in the Roth.

In contrast, if you pay the taxes with taxable money, you have a net gain, and it may even be worth making the conversion if you are going to be in a slightly lower tax bracket at retirement.  If you are in a hypothetical 28% marginal rate now but expect to retire at a 25% marginal rate, and have $11,200 in a taxable account and $40,000 in an IRA, you own 75% of the IRA and probably about 75% of the taxable account, a total of $38,400.  If you convert to a Roth, paying the taxes with the taxable $11,200, you will have a Roth worth $40,000.

===The advantage of a Roth===
If you can max out either a traditional or a Roth IRA or 401(k), you effectively get more tax-advantaged money with the Roth.  You can contribute the same number of dollars either way, but you own all of the Roth and not all of the traditional account.  See [[Traditional versus Roth#"Traditional plus taxable" vs. Roth|"Traditional plus taxable" vs. Roth]] for details.   

Investing in the Roth in this situation is equivalent to investing in a traditional IRA and immediately converting it to a Roth, paying the tax with after-tax dollars.  Therefore, if you are in a much higher tax bracket now than you will be in at retirement, the "traditional plus taxable"  accounts will be better, but if the brackets will be equal or close, you should prefer the Roth.  What constitutes "much higher" and "close" is situation-dependent, and the wiki section mentioned in the paragraph above suggests some tools to help evaluate that.

There is a common belief (promoted by Suze Orman, among others) that [[#Why thinking of individual bond principal return as "safe" is misleading | owning individual bonds is less risky]] than a bond fund, but this is not necessarily true if an appropriate bond fund or collection of funds is chosen.

[[#Duration | Duration]] is an essential attribute for understanding the riskiness of a fund or ladder over time. There is also an important distinction between owning a ladder of individual bonds designed to meet specific future liabilities, and [[#Rolling vs. non-rolling bond ladders | holding a rolling bond ladder]].

== An apparent contradiction ==
Annette Thau, Ph.D. is a former municipal bond analyst who has written about the differences between bond funds and individual bonds:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Annette Thau| title=The Bond Book| edition=2nd| pages=238-239| isbn=978-0-07-135862-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{blockquote|While you can invest in any sector of the bond market either through a bond fund or by buying individual bonds, the two are radically different investments.&lt;br&gt;
The main difference is that an individual bond has a definite maturity date and a fund does not. If you hold a bond to maturity, on that date it will be redeemed at par, regardless of the level of interest rates prevailing on the bond’s maturity date. Assuming a default has not occurred, you get back 100% of your principal. You have also earned a predictable income for the period that you have held the bond, consisting of coupon interest and, if coupons were reinvested, of interest-on-interest.}}

Annette Thau outlined the [[#Why thinking of individual bond principal return as "safe" is misleading | three sources of bond return]], and also outlined the framework for her comparison of individual bonds and bond funds: that of a [[#Rolling vs. non-rolling bond ladders | non-rolling ladder]] of individual bonds over a fixed time period.

While the principal and coupon interest are predictable, the interest-on-interest is not. 

=== The interest-on-interest dilemma ===

To see why interest-on-interest is not predictable, consider your situation as an individual investor who has just purchased a five-year bond. Six months in, your bond pays its first coupon. Excited, you run to the mailbox and pick up the check. But now you have a dilemma: what to do with your newfound riches?

You could buy that shiny new iPad you have been craving, but this was investment money; money that you either had socked away for 5 years from now when the bond matures or (more likely) for an indefinite period in the future, such as retirement. Moreover, if you do not reinvest the interest, you will not get the full annualized yield that made you so excited to buy the bond in the first place. So, you decide to reinvest the coupon payment.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;In theory, you may not get the full annualized yield back. See the [[Talk:Individual bonds vs a bond fund#interest-on-interest discussion a bit misleading?|Discussion tab]] for a detailed explanation.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Your next decision is where to put the money. You can place it in a bank account, but extremely liquid riskless investments like bank accounts generally pay considerably less than investments where you have committed to locking up the money for some time in the future, like bonds or [[certificate of deposit]]s (CDs).

If you buy a bond/CD, you have another decision to make. Do you want to buy another 5-year bond? In doing so you will have constructed not the non-rolling ladder of our current scenario but rather a rolling ladder which we will discuss further down the page. Or do you want to buy a 4.5-year bond (and, with the next coupon payment, a 4 year bond, then a 3.5, then a 3, etc. etc.)? Then you will have constructed a non-rolling ladder, with the bonds purchased with the coupon payments yielding less and less as time goes by because their maturities are shorter and shorter.

Whatever you decide to do with the coupon payment, the interest you receive on the coupon interest (the "interest-on-interest") is uncertain. If you put the coupon money in a bank account, the interest rate varies every day. If you put the coupon money in a bond, because the date you are buying a bond is not the same as the date you bought the main bond, you are subject to current market rates.

=== NAV fluctuations ===
Annette Thau continues:
{{blockquote|Bond funds are comprised of a great many issues. While a number of individual issues may remain in the portfolio until they mature, there is no single date at which the entire portfolio of the fund will mature. In fact, most bond funds maintain a "constant" maturity. For example, the maturity of a long-term bond fund will always remain long term, somewhere between 15 and 25 years. The maturity of a short term bond fund, on the other hand, will always be short, that is, somewhere between one and three years. Consequently, unlike an individual bond, the NAV of a fund does not automatically return to par on a specified date.&lt;br&gt;
As a result, the price at which you will be able to sell shares of a bond fund cannot be known ahead of time. It will be determined by conditions prevailing in that sector of the bond market when you sell your fund.}} 

She goes on to say:
{{blockquote|Another way of looking at this difference is that, if you own an individual bond, each year its market value (its price) moves one year closer to par. But because it has a constant maturity the NAV of a bond fund follows interest rates. For that reason, its future is not predictable.&lt;br&gt;
Because the price of a bond fund does not return to par at a specified maturity date, it cannot quote a yield-to-maturity. As a result, any comparison between the potential return of an individual bond and a bond fund is imprecise. You are comparing apples to oranges.}}

This is not to say that a proper bond fund cannot be used to achieve the same goal as a portfolio of individual bonds with approximately the same risk. The key is her statement that future returns, given constant maturity (more precisely, constant duration) are unknowable, whereas with a declining maturity they can be reasonably well-predicted.

=== Declining vs. constant duration ===

==== Methods of achieving declining vs. constant duration ====

What kinds of tools produce a declining duration?
* An individual bond, with coupons reinvested in some form that is liquid on the bond's date of maturity (for example, a bank account, bonds with shorter and shorter maturities as described above, or CDs with put options)
* A [[zero-coupon bond]], which does not pay out a coupon so that no reinvesting of coupons is required.
* A portfolio of individual bonds, purchased with shorter and shorter maturities. Also known as a [[#Rolling vs. non-rolling bond ladders | non-rolling bond ladder]]
* A target-date bond fund. These are rare funds and tend to have very high expense ratios. We will therefore not consider them further.

What kinds of tools produce a constant duration?
* A portfolio of individual bonds, set up such that when one bond matures another bond of equal maturity is purchased. Also known as a [[#Rolling vs. non-rolling bond ladders | rolling bond ladder]].
* A bond fund, where a manager maintains the portfolio to have a fairly constant duration.

==== Reasons for choosing declining or constant duration ====

Assuming the hassles and expenses associated with each were about the same...

Why would you choose a declining duration portfolio/fund?
* You have a known expense at a future date that you want to set money aside for. Examples include saving for a car, or for some investors, college.

Why would you choose a constant duration portfolio/fund?
* You are saving for expenses with unknown amounts and/or unknown time horizons. Examples include retirement, saving for a house down payment, or for some investors, college.

== A framework for comparing portfolios of individual bonds to bond funds ==

Many, if not most, Bogleheads and other investors use bonds as part of a larger portfolio because of their stabilizing properties on the whole portfolio (in this context, the proper framework for analysis is its historical long-term returns as an [[asset class]], its risks, and its relation to the rest of the portfolio). However, the comparison of bond funds to individual bonds seems less controversial in this context. Therefore this page focuses on the scenario where a fixed, known, future obligation needs to be satisfied.

It is unfortunate that this should be the comparison, as the proper instrument for satisfying such an obligation is a zero-coupon bond, as shall be seen. Nevertheless, it is the scenario which most often comes up in discussion about individual bonds vs. funds. Perhaps the most reasonable argument for using this scenario as the comparison is that, even with long-term investing as part of a diversified investment portfolio of stocks and bonds, at some point you will want to spend the portfolio on the goals for which it was accumulated, and at that point the scenario applies.

What matters is total return, not the return of any one component such as the principal which is often focused on in isolation. Total return has three components:
* Principal
* Interest (coupon payments)
* Interest-on-interest (reinvested coupon payments)

We will discuss what happens to the fund or bond after a single interest-rate change. However, as long as the duration of the portfolio is kept approximately equal to the remaining time horizon, then this single interest rate change generalizes to all interest rate changes. For instance, suppose you purchase a portfolio of bonds or funds with 5-year duration to meet a goal 5 years in the future, and properly rebalance it to keep the duration equal to the investment horizon. With 4 years remaining, a parallel shift of the yield curve occurs.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;For a definition of yield curve shift, see: {{forum link| t=51072| title=Bond fund duration, yield curve}}&lt;/ref&gt; You would be indifferent to that interest rate change because of duration matching. If six months later interest rates change again, you also do not care, because your duration is now 3.5 years and so you are similarly indifferent.

This makes clear a key fact often omitted in the financial advice literature. You cannot apply the recommendation to "keep your duration equal to your need for the money" once and then forget it, but must instead update it continuously (or more realistically, by rebalancing every 3-12 months into shorter-term funds). The only way to achieve duration matching automatically is to purchase a zero-coupon bond. Neither individual bonds nor funds will do this perfectly, although individual bonds come closer (particularly in low-interest rate environments). 

Note that the scenario of rebalancing bond funds or portfolios of individual bonds to meet a known, fixed, future obligation is a bit silly. If you have such an obligation, the safest course of action is to purchase neither a fund nor an individual coupon-paying bond, but instead to purchase a zero-coupon bond maturing on the date needed. Nevertheless, it illustrates the point that your money is safe, as will be elaborated in the rest of this page.

=== Rolling vs. non-rolling bond ladders ===
{{Main|Laddering bonds or CDs}}
If you need to satisfy date-certain future liabilities, a non-rolling ladder of individual bonds is superior to a bond fund. For example, if you commit to make a $10,000 a year payment to a charity for five years, the most effective way to invest for that is to buy 5 zero-coupon bonds, one maturing each year. A non-rolling bond ladder matches cash flows to liabilities, which immunizes a portfolio against interest rate shifts.

However, most bond ladders are "rolling", because they are not designed to deal with date-certain future liabilities. They are created with a specific average duration, and when the oldest bond comes due, a new long-dated bond is purchased to replace it. A rolling ladder of this kind can and should be directly compared with a bond fund using the [[#Major Factors | criteria]] below. According to Vanguard in their [[Individual_Bonds_vs_a_Bond_Fund#Links | paper]] ''Taxable bond investing: Bond funds or individual bonds?'', "The total return of a laddered account with characteristics identical to those of an open-end bond fund will deviate from the fund’s return only by the transaction and operational cost differentials."

As advocated by [[Zvi Bodie]], some people aim to fund their retirement by purchasing a ladder of individual TIPS with durations of 1 to 30 years. The idea is to avoid the volatility of the underlying bonds by always holding them to maturity, so as to avoid having to sell the fund at moments when high yields have caused the NAV to drop.

If you are planning to reinvest (that is, rollover) some of the annual redemption into new individual TIPS bonds, then you have gained nothing by using a rolling ladder over a fund. Because not rolling over the whole bond at the (hypothetically) very high yield has an identical opportunity cost to selling a portion of your fund at the (hypothetically) very low NAV. Another issue with this approach is how to deal with the longevity risk if you outlive your ladder.

Consequently, the distinction between a non-rolling ladder (designed to meet date-certain future liabilities) and a rolling ladder (which essentially represents a personal bond fund) is much more important than the difference between a rolling ladder and a bond fund.

== Rolling ladders and funds are similar ==

It has been regularly argued on the [http://www.bogleheads.org Bogleheads forum] that a bond fund is risky because of [[NAV]] fluctuations. For example, the [[NAV]] for [{{Vf | 0119}} Vanguard Inflation Protected Securities] fell 20.4% from peak to trough in 2008. Instead, it is said, investors should hold individual bonds, which can always be redeemed at face value by holding until maturity.

However, the value of individual bonds held in a personal portfolio fluctuates just as the NAV of a bond fund fluctuates. You can see this by looking at the daily price changes of individual bonds online at [https://fixedincome.fidelity.com/ftgw/fi/FILanding Fidelity's fixed income site]. You can also find bond prices online through [https://personal.vanguard.com/us/FixedIncomeHome Vanguard's Bond Desk]. The daily fluctuation of the price of an individual bond will be similar to a bond fund ''if their duration is the same''.

== Non-rolling ladders vs funds ==

A non-rolling ladder (or a single bond) will behave differently than a bond fund over time. This is because a bond fund (usually) maintains a relatively constant duration. On the other hand, a non-rolling ladder has a duration that decreases over time. If you want to obtain the behavior of a non-rolling ladder using bond funds you must decrease the duration of the bond fund over time. You can do this by by mixing two funds so that their weighted average duration is the same as the ladder which you are trying to mimic. In some cases it may not be possible to find a fund with the duration that you want.

== Duration ==

It is useful to focus on the [[Bonds: advanced topics#Duration | duration]] of your bond fund, such as the Vanguard TIPS Fund, which currently has a duration of [https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/mutual-funds/profile/vipsx#portfolio-composition 6.8 years]. [[William Bernstein]] provides an insightful [http://www.efficientfrontier.com/ef/999/duration.htm definition of duration] as the "point of indifference" for the owner of a bond fund in dealing with interest rate changes.

If interest rates rise after purchasing a bond fund, the NAV of the fund falls, which hurts you. However, the dividends that the bond fund throws off can now be reinvested at a higher rate. The duration is the length of time that an investor needs to hold the fund for the increased yields to compensate for the decrease in NAV. In that sense, duration represents the length of time it would take for the total value of the fund, with dividends reinvested, to be worth exactly what it would have been worth had interest rates not risen. So, you should always hold bond funds with a duration equal to or shorter than the expected need for your money (note that holding the duration shorter than your need for the money leaves you exposed to the risk of lower returns if interest rates fall).

Of course, as discussed above, this definition of duration applies equally to bond funds and to an individual portfolio of bonds. The relationship does not exactly hold if the [[Bonds: advanced topics#Yield_Curves | yield curve]] shifts in a non-parallel fashion, but the difference is expected to be small.

Interest rates change continuously, not just at a single point in time. Therefore, as the time when you will need the money approaches, you must reduce your duration accordingly, to protect you against any further increases in prevailing rates. The ways in which this can be done are discussed below.

=== Why thinking of individual bond principal return as "safe" is misleading ===

The common argument for individual bonds over a fund is that at maturity you are guaranteed to get your principal back. While this is true, the principal is only one of the three sources of return for a bond:
# Principal
# Interest (coupon payments)
# Interest-on-interest (reinvested coupon payments)

According to [[wikipedia:Frank J. Fabozzi|Frank J. Fabozzi]] in the ''Handbook of Fixed Income Securities'', 1991, p97:
{{blockquote|In high interest rate environments, the interest-on-interest component for long-term bonds may be as high as 70 percent of the bond's potential total dollar return.}}

Therefore, focusing on the principal as "safe" misses the point, since in many circumstances it is the smallest component of a bond's return. If you are saving for a large goal, you therefore have to invest considerably more into the bond than you want guaranteed to ensure the need is met by the principal. 

To make sure the total value (all three components listed above) winds up being what you expected it to be, you should maintain a portfolio duration equal to your investment horizon and continually reduce the duration as your investment horizon nears (or more realistically, rebalance every 3-12 months, which Michael Granito in ''Bond Portfolio Immunization'' claims did not cause any substantial deviations from target return vs. continuous rebalancing in a variety of simulated market conditions). A zero-coupon bond does this automatically. A coupon-paying bond does not (duration declines very slowly at first and then more rapidly once the bond nears its maturity; this is more pronounced in high-rate environments and less important in low-rate periods), nor does a bond fund (duration is relatively constant). Stated differently, since the duration of a coupon-paying bond is less than its maturity, if you invest such that the bond matures when you need the money, you are by definition not investing such that the duration is equal to your investment horizon, leaving you vulnerable to interest rate declines.

In another text (''Fixed Income Mathematics'', 1993, p175), Frank J. Fabozzi summarizes:
{{blockquote|Therefore, investing in a coupon bond with a yield to maturity equal to the target yield and a maturity equal to the investment horizon does not assure that the target accumulated value will be achieved.}}

=== Zero-coupon example ===

If you have a sudden need to extract the principal from a bond fund (or portfolio of individually-held bonds, for that matter), you can do so as rapidly as possible by selling the fund and buying a [[zero-coupon bond]] with the face value of your principal. Such a bond will always be available, because if the fund's NAV is down, yields will have gone up a commensurate amount. On average (with a typical yield curve), the bond will have a maturity equal to the duration of the TIPS fund. (A regular TIPS bond would also serve the same purpose, but a zero coupon bond makes the calculation simpler, because the duration equals the maturity.)

The strategy of buying a zero-coupon bond works because the duration of a zero equals the maturity, and therefore declines steadily as time passes. No other commonly-available type of bond instrument has this property (although it can be replicated with bond funds or with individual bonds, provided you rebalance regularly). Therefore, if you have a fixed, known obligation at some future point in time, a zero-coupon bond is the obvious choice to satisfy it.

''For example:'' Fred buys a bond fund while Larry buys bond ladder, each with equal duration. Interest rates skyrocket just afterward. At that moment, Fred and Larry have an equal loss. Fred can log into Vanguard and see that his fund balance is, say, 70% of what he invested. Larry can log into Vanguard Brokerage Services and see that the total value of all of the bonds in his ladder are 70% of what he invested. Whether either decides to realize the loss or not, the loss has in fact occurred.

Now, the only difference between Fred and Larry is that Larry has two options for getting his money back and Fred has one. Fred can sell his bond fund and buy a [[Zero-coupon bond|zero coupon bond]] with a maturity value equal to his initial capital investment. Larry can likewise sell his bond ladder and buy a zero coupon bond. Larry's additional option is to hold all of his bonds until maturity. However, this second option is unambiguously worse for Larry. He would need to hold his longest bonds twice as long as the zero coupon bond to get his money back. Due to the [[wikipedia:Opportunity cost|opportunity cost]] of having his money unnecessarily locked up, this means he would actually be losing money versus the zero coupon option. In addition, for taxable accounts, selling their holdings to buy zero coupon bonds would let Larry and Fred take advantage of [[tax loss harvesting]].

Please note that this whole example is artificial, because it is extremely rare for a bond holder to decide that he needs to immediately liquidate all of his principal. Instead, bond holders are generally interested in steady growth over the long term. Some people suffered 15 or 20% losses in their bond holdings (both fund and ladders) in late 2008. Very few sold their holdings to buy zero coupon bonds. Instead, they continued making periodic contributions like they always do, ignoring the balance of the fund. And this was certainly the right choice, as the funds have regained their previous value.

The whole argument for individual bonds being less risky is based on this completely artificial concept that you will one day decide you need all of your money back, and then happily wait 20 years to get it back (all in nominal terms, meaning the money has been eaten away by inflation in the meantime). The point of using zero coupon bonds is that they are an equally arbitrary option. But they show that Fred is never worse off than Larry: a bond fund is no riskier than a bond ladder.

In real life, people should hold bond funds (high grade, short or intermediate term, and a mix of nominal and inflation-adjusted), and just ignore the NAV. All that matters is total return, and if you hold the fund longer than the duration, your total return will be just fine. The zero coupon example is just an academic way of making that point.

These ideas were discussed on these threads:
* {{Forum link| p=422451| title= How long before a bond fund will at least return principle?}}
* {{Forum link| p=422555| title= TIPS Tip}}
* {{Forum link| p=474508| title= For Bond Lovers}}
* {{Forum link| p=576831| title= Bond funds vs. individual bonds}}

== Convexity ==

Positive convexity, a characteristic possessed by bonds without options, is ignored in the above discussion but only strengthens the argument, since positive convexity lengthens duration when rates fall and shortens duration when rates rise. The [[Bonds: advanced topics#Convexity|advanced bonds section]] contains more detail.

== Yield curve changes ==

Changes in the shape of the [[Bonds: advanced topics#Yield_Curves|yield curve]] may make a difference in the above comparison, but the effect is expected to be minor and ambivalent in direction.

However, given the normal (non-inverted) shape of the yield curve, absent any interest rate changes the narrower spread of durations in a long-term or intermediate-term fund will usually prevail over the typical individual's rolling bond ladder of the same duration (where bonds are purchased and held until maturity, then rolled over into new bonds). This strategy is referred to as "riding the yield curve"&lt;ref&gt;{{forum link| t=132601| title=Riding the yield curve, in action| date=February 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, while not without risk does come with an expected return bonus. The risk can be summarized in terms of a lower convexity, which implies that interest rate changes will have a greater impact on a narrow, "bullet" portfolio than on a broader, "barbell" portfolio.

== Major factors ==

=== Diversification ===

Diversification is important for bonds, as it is for all asset classes. The argument against an investor ever owning individual [[Corporate bonds |corporate]] or [[Municipal bonds |municipal bonds]] (even in a ladder) is that the effect of a single default (such as a corporation or city brought down by fraud), even if unlikely, could be devastating to your portfolio. By contrast, bond funds allow extremely broad diversification at a very low cost.

A ladder of individual bonds generally includes between 10 and a couple dozen bonds. That means that each bond represents 2.5% to 10% of a portfolio. By contrast [{{Vf | 0084}} Total Bond] owns [{{Vf | 0084}} 3855 different bonds], and [{{Vf | 0042}} Intermediate Term Tax Exempt] owns [{{Vf | 0042}} 1971]. So, the failure (default) of any one bond has a minuscule effect on the fund.

The only exceptions are Treasury bonds (including [[TIPS]]). Because all Treasury bonds are explicitly backed by the US government, they have the highest possible credit rating. They also all have the same issuer. There is no diversification benefit from owning a Treasury bond fund instead of individual Treasury bonds.

=== Convenience ===

Investors in a bond fund can buy or sell additional shares at any time in any quantity. There is usually no transaction fee for buying or selling additional shares. With individual bonds, purchases on the primary market may only be made on the pre-set issuer schedule (for example, every few months for TIPS). Purchases on the secondary market are generally subject to a commission and you always pay a [[bid/ask spread]], which can be substantial. Also, individual bond purchases are only available in increments of $1,000 (and more often $5,000 or $10,000).

Bond funds offer automatic dividend reinvestment. While you are in your accumulation phase, it is far more convenient to have dividends automatically reinvested. Even after beginning to spend your holdings, it is generally simpler to have bond funds automatically reinvest dividends and then just sell a fixed amount of the fund monthly or quarterly. By contrast, there is no simple way to reinvest small amounts into individual bonds. It is also far more convenient to [[Rebalancing |rebalance]] between a bond fund and other assets in your portfolio.

Taxes are simpler for bond funds. If you invest in a bond fund in a taxable account, you receive tax forms from the bond fund company. If you have a portfolio of individual bonds, you receive tax forms from TreasuryDirect or your brokerage account listing the tax-related items for each bond. it is easier to figure out the tax reporting for one bond fund versus many individual bonds. Also, owners of individual TIPS owe a tax on [[TIPS#Tax considerations | phantom income]] that they do not receive. This is not an issue with TIPS funds.

On the other hand, for investors who are accustomed to managing a portfolio of individual bonds, a rolling bond ladder can be fairly simple to manage and can be simpler to understand conceptually. This is made somewhat more complicated when individual issues are discontinued, leaving a hole in the bond ladder. For instance, there were no 20-year Treasuries issued from 1986-1993. The solution is either to find equivalent combinations of bonds which keep the overall duration the same (in a 6% interest rate environment, to replace the 20-year you could use 36% 10-year and 64% 30-year bonds), or to buy a longer issue from which some time has elapsed on the secondary market (for example, buy a 30-year bond issued 10 years ago) and bear the cost of the poor spread individuals receive when buying bonds in small lots.

=== Costs ===

The costs associated with owning bonds are commissions, [[bid/ask spread]]s, and management fees. Primary purchases of bonds (such as at a TIPS auction) generally do not incur commissions or bid/ask spreads. Purchases and sales on a secondary market can have substantial commissions and bid/ask spreads, particularly on less liquid bonds like [http://moneywatch.bnet.com/investing/blog/irrational-investor/municipal-bonds-and-the-industrys-dirty-little-secret/1621/ municipals] and corporates. Spreads also tend to be wider for the smaller value transactions that individual investors make.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;[[Larry Swedroe]] [http://moneywatch.bnet.com/investing/blog/wise-investing/the-truth-about-municipal-bond-costs/1502/?tag=col1;blog-river comments]{{dead link}} that: "The bid side will widen as the trade size gets smaller (unlike that for stocks)".&lt;/ref&gt; Except for primary purchases of Treasury bonds and TIPS, bond funds pay much lower bid/ask spreads on their bond transactions, giving them a significant cost advantage over regular investors purchasing individual bonds. Even for Treasuries bought at auction, the cost discrepancy is not clear-cut; off-the-run Treasuries generally pay higher yields than new issues of the same effective maturity, mitigating much of the advantage of buying new issues with no spread. Larry Swedroe has pointed out out that the same phenomenon exists in the municipal bond market as well.

There is no management fee for holding a portfolio of individual bonds. However, there is an opportunity cost associated with the time to do so. If you enjoy purchasing TIPS in auction, than this time is really a consumption item rather than an expense. If tracking auction dates and the shape of the yield curve does not seem like fun, than it should be treated as a real cost. For example, holding $100,000 of VAIPX (Vanguard [{{Vf | 5119}} Inflation-Protected Securities Fund Admiral]) costs $110 per year (with an expense ratio of 0.11%). If you value your time at $55 an hour, it is more cost effective to use this fund than hold your own portfolio of bonds if it takes you more than two hours a year to manage your portfolio.

=== Control over maturity and other bond characteristics ===

==== Control over maturity ====

By managing your own portfolio of bonds, you can either pick the average duration you want or "ride" the [[Bonds: advanced topics#Yield Curves | yield curve]] to pick up bonds that are "cheap" compared to the [[Laddering Bonds or CDs | ladder]] overall, and allow your [[Bonds: advanced topics#Duration|duration]] to fluctuate with your purchases. In either case, you are in control. With a bond fund, the duration is designed not to move more than a year or two and is managed by the fund.

However, you need to consider who is in the best position to find bonds that are slightly under-priced, you or a dozen expert bond analysts at a fund company whose only job it is to follow the bond market? 

Also, if you would like a shorter duration than offered by a bond fund, it is easy to shorten it by putting a portion of the money in a [[Money Markets | money market fund]]. For example, the Vanguard municipal bond fund for New York has an average maturity of [{{Vf | 0076}} 11.1 years]. You can approximately halve that by holding half of your money in that fund and half in the [{{Vf | 0163}} New York Tax Exempt Money Market]. Depending on the shape of the yield curve (concave vs. convex), this may cost you return.

==== Control over convexity ====

While it is relatively easy to calculate the [[Bonds: advanced topics#Convexity | convexity]] of a portfolio of individual bonds, most bond funds (including Vanguard&lt;ref&gt;{{forum link| p=655486| title=Convexity information on Vanguard bond funds}}&lt;/ref&gt;) do not make the convexity of their funds available. This opens the door for manager risk (where unscrupulous managers can "juice" their yield by buying bonds with lower convexity, so that investors will never know until it is too late). However, while investors in a portfolio of individual bonds can calculate the convexity, few do, in part because taking advantage of this generally requires purchasing on the secondary market, which is expensive for small portfolios. Therefore the real-world application of this difference may be limited.

==== Control over inflation factor ====

There is an additional factor to consider for [[Treasury_Inflation_Protected_Securities|TIPS]], in that buying individual issues gives you control over the "inflation factor" (also known as the "index ratio"). This allows you to manage deflation risk (generally at some premium which reflects the market's expectation of deflation).

==== Control over tax-efficient characteristics ====

Some managers may choose to purchase AMT bonds to increase yield, which disadvantages investors subject to this tax. This is easily avoided by researching the fund's holdings.

==== Control over call risk ====

Managers may also choose to purchase bonds with higher call risk to boost the fund's yield, which disadvantages investors if the risk shows up at the wrong time or if they are not planning for this risk in their overall portfolio. Careful research into long-term track records and holdings of funds will mitigate this problem.

==== Control over liquidity ====

Bond funds have to meet redemptions at any time. They may handle this in at least two ways: by holding cash reserves or by investing in more liquid bonds (for example, on-the-run Treasuries vs. off-the-run Treasuries). Both approaches earn lower yields on the proportion of the fund held as liquidity reserves.

==== Availability of other fixed income types ====

CDs are not available in a bond fund. Often CDs yield more than the equivalently risk-free Treasury of similar duration.

=== Manager risk and opacity === 

Select bond funds carefully. The experience of Schwab YieldPlus Investor [http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=swypx&amp;d=t (SWYPX)] demonstrates this risk. An UltraShort bond fund that was billed as a safe alternative to money market funds lost over 50% of its NAV. Read the prospectus carefully for indications such as the use of complicated derivatives (options, futures, options on futures, swaps), leverage, short sales, junk bonds, foreign and emerging market bonds, convertible securities, mortgage dollar rolls, and so on. YieldPlus used all of these. While it is possible to use these tools to reduce risk, it is also possible to greatly magnify the risk in exchange for only small gains in yield. The rise of bond index funds holds the possibility of eliminating manager risk entirely, leaving only the much smaller risk of tracking error.

=== Tax-loss harvesting ===

[[Larry Swedroe]] [http://moneywatch.bnet.com/investing/blog/irrational-investor/bonds-or-bond-funds-an-easy-choice/873/?tag=col1;blog-river makes the interesting point]{{dead link}} that holding a portfolio of individual bonds lets you [[Tax_loss_harvesting | tax-loss harvest]] at the single-bond level; with a fund you can only tax-loss harvest when a whole fund incurs a loss. The magnitude of this benefit is unclear and will depend on your tax bracket. Because bid-ask spreads tend to be large on the secondary market (particularly for non-Treasuries), this strategy is not viable for most individual investors. Moreover, because Boglehead strategy is to [[Principles_of_Tax-Efficient_Fund_Placement | place bonds in tax-advantaged spaces whenever possible]], the ability to tax-loss harvest is likely quite limited for most smaller investors (as he himself points out, "For typical smaller investor bond funds are the ONLY way to go."). For larger portfolios involving Treasuries in taxable accounts, Larry Swedroe's insight may tip the balance in favor of holding individual bonds.

== When to hold which ==

As explained earlier, the value of a rolling bond ladder reacts the same to market changes as the NAV of a bond fund if their holdings are the same so daily price fluctuations should not be a consideration. However, there are other factors to consider when choosing between a bond fund and a rolling ladder of individual issues, as detailed below. The principal tradeoff for a long-term investor is the diversification of bond funds and the low trading costs vs. the expense ratio of the fund.

For bond categories with high credit risk such as [[Corporate bonds| corporate bonds]], [[High yield bonds |high yield bonds]], or [[Emerging market bonds |emerging market bonds]], bond funds are the clear choice because the diversification benefit clearly exceeds the expense ratio. For [[Municipal bonds |municipal bonds]] the picture is less clear, as default rates are quite low; nevertheless for small-to-medium-sized portfolios ([http://moneywatch.bnet.com/investing/blog/irrational-investor/bonds-or-bond-funds-an-easy-choice/873/?tag=col1;blog-river Larry Swedroe suggests $500k minimum portfolio size whereas Alan Roth suggests $50m]{{dead link}}) the diversification benefit still argues for a fund, as does the liquidity premium (bid/ask spreads are quite high for municipal bonds).

For [[Treasury bonds |treasury bonds]] (including [[Treasury_Inflation_Protected_Securities | TIPS]]), which are assumed to lack any credit risk, the diversification of a fund adds little benefit over a rolling bond ladder. Therefore the expense ratio is merely a convenience fee (or perhaps a small liquidity premium). For a low-cost Treasury fund, however, that fee may be reasonable and is a matter of personal preference. If the greater liquidity and lower demands on investor time of a fund are not desired, the preferred method of investing in Treasuries is to purchase individual bonds at auction (which is generally free), assuming the spread over equivalent off-the-run issues is not too large. This is particularly true you are considering [[CDs_vs_bonds | CDs as a substitute for Treasuries]], as they often yield more and are unavailable in fund form.

A '''three-fund portfolio''' is a portfolio which uses only basic asset classes &amp;mdash; usually a domestic stock "total market" [[index fund]], an international stock "total market" index fund and a bond "total market" index fund. It is often recommended for and by Bogleheads attracted by "the majesty of simplicity" ([[John Bogle]]'s phrase), and for those who want finer control and better tax-efficiency than they would get in an all-in-one fund like a [[Target date retirement funds | target retirement fund]].

There is no magic in the number three. The phrase is shorthand for a style of portfolio construction that emphasizes simplicity, and is related to [[Lazy_portfolios#Three-fund_lazy_portfolios|lazy portfolios]].

A three-fund portfolio is based on the fundamental asset classes, [[Stock basics |stocks]] and [[Bond basics | bonds]]. It is assumed that [[Money Markets | cash]] is not counted within the investment portfolio, so it is not included. On the other hand, it is assumed that every investor should hold both [[Domestic/International |domestic and international stocks]]. The task, then, is to take these three basic non-cash assets &amp;mdash; domestic stocks, international stocks, and bonds &amp;mdash; decide how much of each to hold (your [[Asset allocation|asset allocation]]). Choose where to hold each of these asset classes, and finally choose a mutual fund to use for each asset class.

===Choosing your asset allocation===
{{Main|Asset allocation}}
{{Notice| '''You must decide for yourself what percentage of stocks to hold''', based in part on your personal risk tolerance. There are no shortcuts and and it needs to be done no matter what investment approach you are using.}}

Even if you are going to use a single Target Retirement fund, you should not take the shortcut implied by the use of a retirement year in the name; you need to decide for yourself what percentage of your portfolio you want to invest in stocks, and choose the fund that matches it. Even if you are going to use a single [[Vanguard funds: life strategy funds vs target retirement funds | LifeStrategy fund]], you need to decide which of them to use, based on the percentage of stocks each you hold.

One traditional rough rule-of-thumb is "age in bonds," or percentage of stocks = 100 - age. This is a conservative rule, and leads to smaller percentages of stocks than Vanguard chooses for [[Vanguard target retirement funds |its Target Retirement series]].

The second decision is what percentage of your stock allocation should be U.S. (domestic) and what should be international. This is a much less critical decision because U.S. and international stocks have similar risk profiles and have similar long-term returns. In 2010, Vanguard increased the international allocation of its Target Retirement and LifeStrategy funds from 20% of the stock allocation to 30%, and increased it again to 40% in 2015.

&lt;!--

Author note -- as of 2023, this Vanguard tool no longer exists.

====Vanguard's tool====
As of 2020, Vanguard provides a tool that recommends a balanced portfolio similar to the kind discussed here (Vanguard recommends a [[Vanguard four fund portfolio|four fund portfolio]]), with percentages based on your responses to a short online questionnaire. The tool is entitled [https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/tools/recommendation?reset=true Get a recommendation to fit your goals]; you can navigate to it by way of Vanguard.com, Go to personal investors' site, What we offer: Mutual Funds, Get a Recommendation.

See [[Asset allocation]] for more details.
--&gt;
===Choosing your asset location===

Since your portfolio may be split between multiple locations (one or more tax-advantaged retirement accounts, and one or more taxable accounts) you should look at [[tax-efficient fund placement]] to determine which funds belong in each account. In general, the international fund should go into a taxable account, the bond fund should go into a tax-advantaged account, and the domestic equity fund should fill in the remaining space.

You may need to hold the same (or equivalent) funds in multiple accounts to have ideal asset allocation and asset location.

===Choosing three funds===

For Bogleheads, the answer for "which mutual funds" to use in a three-fund portfolio is "low-cost funds that represent entire markets." 

If you ask different people to choose funds for a three-fund portfolio, you will get different fund choices. The differences are usually of no fundamental importance, and are usually the result of a) making choices between nearly identical, almost interchangeable funds, and b) simplifying further by using combination package funds. Watch out for high expense ratios, particularly in the bond funds.

====Vanguard funds====

From Vanguard's list of "core funds," the funds that are best for a three-fund portfolio are:

* Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund (VTSAX)
* Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund (VTIAX)
* Vanguard Total Bond Market Fund (VBTLX)

So, a "three-fund portfolio" might consist of 42% Total Stock Market Index, 18% Total International Stock Index, and 40% Total Bond Market fund. For example, [[Taylor Larimore |Taylor Larimore's]] "[[Lazy portfolios|Lazy Portfolio]]" consists of these three funds based on the investor's desired asset allocation.

Of course, you could use [[Exchange-traded funds | ETF]]s rather than mutual funds. For example, you could use Total Stock Market ETF (VTI),&lt;ref group="note"&gt; See [[Vanguard US stock ETFs]] for information on VTI (Total Market Index).&lt;/ref&gt; Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund (VXUS)&lt;ref group="note"&gt; See [[Vanguard international stock ETFs]] for information on VXUS (Total International ETF).&lt;/ref&gt; for international, and Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF (BND).

====Other than Vanguard, Boglehead-style====

The building blocks of Boglehead-style investing are low-[[Expense ratios |expense-ratio]] [[Indexing |index]] mutual funds and/or [[Exchange-traded funds |ETFs]]. Vanguard fans would suggest that Vanguard has the best and most complete lineup of such funds, and that the most convenient place to hold Vanguard mutual funds is directly at Vanguard. As a result, the Bogleheads forum and Wiki tends to be Vanguard-oriented. But investing according to the [[Bogleheads investment philosophy | Boglehead philosophy]] certainly does not require you to invest at Vanguard or use Vanguard products. Here are some suggestions on how to do it with other funds. (Refer to the associated wiki article for additional information.)

Some brokerages such as [[Merrill Edge]] do not offer their own family of mutual funds so you will to consider different fund families. First ask your brokerage which mutual funds have no transaction fees. You typically will choose between two options: a) the lowest cost funds like Vanguard's but with a transaction fee, or b) higher cost funds like T. Rowe Price's but with no transaction fee. The best choice depends on how often you buy or sell and how much you invest over time.

====Other considerations====

A total stock market index fund represents the whole market, while an S&amp;P 500 fund does not. Now that total stock market funds exist and have expenses just as low as S&amp;P 500 funds, total stock market funds are preferable. In practice, the importance and magnitude of the difference is a subject of debate. In a 401(k) plan with limited choices you might very well opt for an S&amp;P 500 index fund to serve as the domestic stock component of a three-fund portfolio.

Alternatively, you can [[Approximating total stock market |approximate a Total Stock Market fund]] by combining an S&amp;P 500 index fund with one or more mid-cap and small-cap funds. There are "[[Extended market index fund|completion index]]" funds such as Vanguard's Extended Market fund (available as an open-end fund as VEXAX and as an ETF as VXF) which can be added to an S&amp;P 500 fund in a specified ratio to produce a hybrid which should perform like a Total Stock Market fund.

Vanguard perplexes investors by offering two virtually interchangeable international stock market index funds: Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund (VTIAX) and Vanguard FTSE All-World ex-US (VFWAX). See [[FAQ on Vanguard international funds#Should_I_buy_Total_International_or_FTSE_All-World_ex-US.3F|Should I buy Total International or FTSE All-World ex-US]] for the details.

For Vanguard, be aware of any minimum investment required by each fund; for instance, the Admiral shares of most Vanguard index funds require a minimum investment of $3,000. If you will have difficulty meeting these minimums, you may want to consider an all-in-one single-fund portfolio until you accumulate enough that this is not an issue.

The Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Fund, and those of several other firms, track the Barclay's U.S. Aggregate Index (in Vanguard's case, the Barclay's U.S. Aggregate Float-Adjusted Index). In Barclay's words, this index tracks the "investment grade, US dollar-denominated, fixed-rate taxable bond market." The "bond market" is a somewhat diffuse concept. Some people complain that the Aggregate index is not really the "total" bond market. Barclay's has a broader index, the Barclay's U.S. Universal Index. It includes "USD-denominated, taxable bonds that are rated either investment grade or high-yield." As of 2015, 87% of the Universal index is made up of bonds in the Aggregate index, but the other 13% includes "U.S. Corporate High Yield Index, Investment Grade 144A Index, Eurodollar Index, U.S. Emerging Markets Index, and the non-ERISA eligible portion of the CMBS Index." People who have strong feelings about wanting to be more "total" than the Vanguard Total Bond Index Fund might prefer the Barclay's Universal index. As of 2015, there is at least one product, the iShares Core Total USD Bond Market ETF, IUSB, that tracks the Barclay's Universal index, and with an 0.13% expense ratio, it qualifies as a "low-cost index fund." It could be used as the bond component of a three-fund portfolio.

====Combining domestic and international stocks====

The relative percentage of domestic and international stocks is a subject of intense discussion in the forum. One sensible option is to hold domestic and international stocks in the same proportions as they represent in the total world economy. As of October 2014, that would be about 50% U.S. and 50% international. This option is recommended by Burton Malkiel and Charles Ellis, both of whom have longstanding ties to Vanguard, in their book ''The Elements of Investing''. Other authorities suggest holding less than that, and Vanguard currently allocates 40% of stock to international in its [[Vanguard Target Retirement Funds |Target Retirement funds]], and in their research, advise holding 20-40% international allocations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.vanguard.com/pdf/flgiecr.pdf| title=International Equity: Considerations and Recommendations| publisher=Vanguard Investment Counseling &amp; Research| date=January 2, 2009| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200513135423/https://www.vanguard.com/pdf/flgiecr.pdf| archive-date=May 13, 2020| accessdate=June 5, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; If your own preference is for a "total world" weighting, then the portfolio can obviously be simplified using Vanguard's Total World Stock Index fund, which is exactly what Malkiel and Ellis suggest. Such a two-fund portfolio would use these funds:

* Vanguard Total World Stock Index Fund (VTWSX) for both domestic and international stocks
* Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Fund (VBTLX)

====Combining stocks and bonds====

The Vanguard Balanced Index Fund holds 60% Total Stock Market Index Fund and 40% Total Bond Market Index Fund. By adding an international stock fund, you could create a three-fund portfolio with two funds.

==Adequacy of a three-fund portfolio==

One Marketwatch article&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Jonathan Burton| date=December 5, 2006| url=https://www.marketwatch.com/story/story/print?guid=F047C5E4-3F49-451A-9A69-FD8FBF2D3A15| title=Three mutual funds that end the guesswork| publisher=Market watch| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210224224221/https://www.marketwatch.com/story/these-three-mutual-funds-may-be-all-youll-ever-need| archive-date=June 5, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; quotes various '''non'''-Boglehead commentators as saying such things as "You can make it really simple, be well-diversified, and do better than two-thirds of investors" and "That three-pronged approach is going to beat the vast majority of the individual stock and bond portfolios that most people have at brokerage firms... there is a certain elegance in the simplicity of it."

In her Forbes article, ''"How To Diversify With Just Three Funds"'', Boglehead [[Laura Dogu | Laura F. Dogu]] describes this approach and comments "With only these three funds (Vanguard Total Stock Market Index fund, Vanguard Total International Stock Market Index fund, and the Vanguard Total Bond Market fund), investors can create a low cost, broadly diversified portfolio that is very easy to manage and rebalance.... Some investors may be uncomfortable with holding only three funds and will question whether they are truly diversified. With these three holdings the answer on diversification is a resounding 'YES'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Laura Dogu| date=January 28, 2011 |url=https://blogs.forbes.com/thebogleheadsview/2011/01/28/three-funds-to-own-now| title=How To Diversify With Just Three Funds| publisher=Forbes| accessdate=June 5, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2015 article, ''"The only funds you need in your portfolio now"'', Walter Updegrave commented: "Of course, some advisers will suggest that you're missing out unless you spread your money among all manner of exotic investments (which they're more than happy to sell you). But the more complicated your portfolio is, the more expensive and more prone to blow-ups it is likely to be -- which also increases the odds that it will generate subpar returns," and suggested a "three-fund diversified portfolio: simply invest in the following three funds (or their ETF equivalents): a total U.S. stock market fund, a total international stock market fund and a total U.S bond market fund."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Walter Updegrave| date=December 30, 2014| url=https://money.cnn.com/2014/12/30/retirement/portfolio-funds/| title=The only funds you need in your portfolio now| publisher=CNN Money| accessdate=June 5, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some would argue that a three-fund portfolio is good enough and that there is no real proof that more complicated portfolios are any better. Others would argue that the evidence for superiority of [[Slice and dice|slice and dice]], "[[Value tilting - stock |small value tilting]]," and inclusion of classes like [[REIT]]s is too strong to ignore.

==What about bonds?==

As of 2016 when this is being written, bond interest rates are near historic lows and there is a good deal of buzz to the effect that the "thirty-year bull market in bonds has ended" and that investing strategies that have worked for decades should be changed to reflect new realities. Should the three-fund portfolio be modified? No definitive answer can be given to this controversial question, but we can sketch out some of the prevalent '''and conflicting''' opinions on the matter.

# Some would say that advocates of complex investing strategies '''always''' have reasons why simple approaches "once worked but do not work any more." Advocates of simplicity might say to ignore the noise and continue to stay the course; it may turn out that something else does better--something always does--but that a three-fund portfolio is still good enough.
# In 2013, Vanguard altered the composition of its Target Retirement funds; from 2010 to 2013, most of them were literally three-fund portfolios as described here. Now, the bond portion has been modified to include international bonds; specifically, the bond allocation is now 70% Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Fund and 30% Total International Bond Index Fund. Nothing Vanguard has published would lead you to believe that this is a big change or that it will have a big effect. Some may find it appealing to follow Vanguard's lead.
# Some well-informed Bogleheads make a strong case that the "bond" component of a three-fund portfolio might well be filled with non-[[Certificate_of_deposit#Brokered_CDs|brokered]] bank CDs instead of a traditional bond fund.
# Suggestions 2 and 3 are adjustments that do not radically change the risk of the bond component. For the record, it should be stated that Burton Malkiel and Charles Ellis, in the 2013 edition of their book ''Elements of Investing,'' made a controversial and much more radical suggestion, which shocked many forum members. But, because they were early champions of indexing, each with long associations with Vanguard, their suggestion should be noted. They seemed to be recommending the replacement of a traditional high-grade bond fund with a 50/50 mix of emerging markets bonds and a high-dividend stock fund. Using Vanguard's "risk potential" categories, that means they are recommending replacing a holding in risk potential category 2 with a mix of holdings in categories 3 and 4.

Following the resurgence of inflation in 2021, [[Treasury Inflation Protected Securities]] (TIPS) have now become more popular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://blbarnitz4.wordpress.com/2016/12/04/a-three-fund-portfolio-tailored-for-stable-retirement-spending/#more-4071| title=A Three Fund Portfolio tailored for stable retirement spending| publisher=Bogleheads® blog| accessdate=August 2, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contrasts with other approaches==

There are single, all-in-one, "funds of funds" that are intended to be used as an investor's whole portfolio. Vanguard funds in this category include the Target Retirement funds, the LifeStrategy funds; perhaps the actively-managed Wellington and Wellesley funds would qualify, too.

On the one hand, a three-fund portfolio involves a do-it-yourself aspect that makes it more complicated than using an all-in-one fund. For example, because different assets grow at different rates, any investor who chooses a do-it-yourself approach needs to "[[Rebalancing |rebalance]]" occasionally &amp;mdash; perhaps annually &amp;mdash; in order to maintain the desired percentage mix. 

On the other hand, three-fund portfolios are simpler than the genres called "Coffeehouse portfolios" ([[Bill Schultheis |William Schultheis's]] term), "couch potato" portfolios, or "[[Lazy portfolios |lazy portfolios]]," which are intended to be easy for do-it-yourselfers but are nevertheless slice-and-dice portfolios using six or more funds.

==The LifeStrategy and Target Retirement funds are four-fund portfolios==
{{Main|Vanguard four fund portfolio}}

The Vanguard Target Retirement funds and LifeStrategy funds use a four fund allocation.&lt;ref group="note"&gt; The Vanguard Target Retirement Income fund, and Target funds nearing target dates add a fifth fund, the Vanguard Short Term Inflation Indexed Bond Fund, to the allocation. &lt;/ref&gt; The funds include:

*Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund
*Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund
*Vanguard Total Bond Market II Index Fund
*Vanguard Total International Bond Index Fund

Some see advantages in holding a do-it-yourself four-fund portfolio rather than a LifeStrategy fund or Target Retirement fund, even if the same four funds are used. The advantages are small but meaningful to some, and include:

* Improved tax efficiency for taxable investors by placing each fund in its best location
* Direct control over allocation percentages
* Independence from Vanguard's small course changes in the Target Retirement funds (as when they increased stock allocation in 2006, and changed domestic-to-international ratio in 2010, and added international bonds in 2013)
* Availability of slightly-lower-cost Admiral shares in the individual funds, but not the Target Retirement or LifeStrategy funds

==Lazy portfolios==
{{main|Lazy portfolios}}

Lazy portfolios are ''specific'' portfolio suggestions, designed to perform well in most market conditions. Most contain a small number of low-cost funds that are easy to rebalance. They are "lazy" in that the investor can maintain the same asset allocation for an extended period of time, as they generally contain 30-40% bonds, suitable for most pre-retirement investors.

The term has been popularized by Paul B. Farrell, who writes MarketWatch columns about various simple portfolios. Instead of going through the step of deciding on your own asset allocation, you accept the suggestion that, say, 2/3 stocks to 1/3 bonds and half-and-half domestic and international is a good enough, one-size-fits-all allocation.

==Other variations==
{{See also|Variations on Bogleheads® investing}}

A three-fund combination can serve as the core of a more complex portfolio, where you add a small [[Variations on Bogleheads® investing#Having a play money account|play money allocation]] or a [[Tilt|tilt]] to some corner of the market that interests you.

==Historic notes==

* Scott Burns wrote a 1991 article, "Exactly How To Be A Couch Potato Portfolio Manager". The original "basic, humble, couch potato portfolio" consisted of two funds, "the Vanguard Index 500 fund, which mimics the S&amp;P 500 index, and the Vanguard Fixed Income Short Term Government Bond Fund."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Scott Burns| date=October 1, 1991| url=https://assetbuilder.com/knowledge-center/articles/scott-burns/exactly_how_to_be_a_couch_potato_portfolio_manager| title=Exactly How To Be A Couch Potato Portfolio Manager| publisher=Asset Builder| url-access=limited}} (limited access)&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Taylor Larimore]] was an early advocate of this approach, which he described in 1999 in a Morningstar posting, "[https://web.archive.org/web/20210307193847/http://socialize.morningstar.com/NewSocialize/ViewPost.aspx?apptype=0&amp;PostID=17632 Which is better, 15 funds or 4?]" He stated that "It is no longer necessary to own large portfolios. Now, with only four funds, it is possible to own all the securities in every asset-class, style, and cap-size, in exact proportion to their market weight. These four funds are: Total Stock Market Fund, Total Bond Market Fund, Total International Fund and a Money-Market Fund."

{{for|additional information|wikipedia:Preferred stock}}

A '''preferred stock''', also known as a preferred share or simply a ''preferred'', is a share of stock carrying additional rights above and beyond those conferred by common stock. These rights include priority in receiving dividends and precedence (after creditors) over common stock shareholders in claims to corporate assets upon liquidation.

==Characteristics==
However in return for these benefits, preferred stock has limited upside. The stock is normally issued at a fixed price (say $10.00 per share) paying a fixed dividend (say $0.60). The price of the shares will fluctuate with interest rates-- down if interest rates go up, up if they go down, like bonds. They will also fluctuate with the perceived financial health of the issuer. If the stock is called or redeemed investors will normally only get par value (that is, $10.00 per share). Examples of situations that would cause this to occur include: if the stock is redeemed by the investor (if it has such a provision); called by the issuer (many of them include a call provision allowing the issuer to call them early at its discretion); or the issuer is taken over or liquidated.&lt;ref name="VT"&gt;{{forum link| p=1930113| title=Re: Can you talk me out of Preferred Stocks?| author=Valuethinker}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==As an investment==
Preferred stock, as a yield investment, acts similar to a fixed income security, the price reacting primarily to changes in interest rates. Preferreds regularly offer high yields, but in addition to interest rate risk, they are usually subject to call risk and nontrivial credit risk. Some preferreds pay qualified dividends, currently taxable to individuals at a maximum 15% rate.&lt;ref name="VT" /&gt;

Preferred stock (or shares) was once widely issued to investors looking for yield. However since the late 1970s it has become possible for most companies to issue [[High yield bonds|high yield (junk) bonds]], which have many of the same characteristics of preferred stock but where the interest coupon paid is deductible from corporate taxes. Therefore this is a more efficient form of finance from the perspective of the issuer.&lt;ref name="VT" /&gt;

The exception to this general rule is in the case of some financial stocks, particularly banks. Regulators require financial companies to have a certain amount of capital, to shield depositors against losses on their assets such as bad loans. In the balance sheet formula Assets (such as loans and mortgages for a bank) = Liabilities (Depositors and bonds) + Equity. Bank leverage (the ratio between Assets and Equity) is limited to certain maximums by regulators. Included in regulatory capital is common stock (ordinary shares), retained earnings and some forms of securities including hybrid bonds and preference stock (or preference shares). So financial institutions issue preference stock to boost their capital and reduce their leverage.&lt;ref name="VT" /&gt;

==Performance==
The performance of preference stock tends to track the performance of bonds issued by the same company, reflecting both the general level of interest rates and the market's view of the financial health of a company. If a company becomes financially distressed or bankrupt, then a restructuring is likely. Because preference shareholders rank behind debt holders (such as bond investors) in the sale or liquidation of the company, they usually get very little or nothing if there is a bankruptcy situation. In addition, if the company becomes financially distressed, the directors may deem it prudent that the company not pay any preference dividends-- preferred shareholders have limited legal rights in such a situation, whereas bondholders facing a skipped interest payment have the rights of creditors.&lt;ref name="VT" /&gt;

In a sense then preference stock often combines the worst features of corporate bonds (frequently callable; lack of upside) with those of common stock (little protection in bankruptcy; possibility dividend will be omitted). In addition portfolios of preference shares are highly concentrated around financial companies, thus reducing diversification.&lt;ref name="VT" /&gt;

==Role in a portfolio==
{{Quote
|quote =As a hybrid product in between stocks and bonds, just like junk bonds--junk bonds are stockish bonds, preferred stocks are bondish stocks...
|source=— {{forum link| p=1929005| title=Can you talk me out of Preferred Stocks?}}}}
For the reasons above, investing in preference stock is usually not recommended. The risk-return tradeoffs are unfavourable for individual investors. For corporate credit risk exposure, use corporate bond funds; for equity returns, use diversified index funds made up of common stock (like Vanguard Total Stock Market).

==Convertible preferred stocks==
{{Main|Convertible security}}
Companies do issue ''convertible preferred'' stock, which is stock which carries a right to convert into common stock at a certain pre-specified exercise (or strike) price. The analysis of the value of this option (effectively a long dated call option) to the investor is complex and it is a relatively risky area that requires expertise to make successful investments.&lt;ref name="VT" /&gt;

Unlike convertible bonds, ''convertible preferreds'' lack a maturity date -- unless they are redeemable and a date is specified at issue. ''Convertible preferreds'' have greater equity upside potential than ''straight preferreds,'' but normally lower starting yields and greater volatility.&lt;ref name="VG"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://personal.vanguard.com/us/insights/article/keele-convertible-securities-04152013| title=What you need to know about convertible securities| publisher=Vanguard}}{{dead link}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="VT2"&gt;{{forum link| p=1939177| title=Re: Wiki - Convertible Securities| author=Valuethinker}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Venture capital issuances==
Preference stock is also issued in venture capital deals. Venture capital funds invest into private companies to accelerate their growth, with the eventual goal of a sale to a trade buyer or an IPO. Typically they invest in "rounds" (A Round, B Round, etc.) and do so using preference shares (which usually have the right to convert to common stock on sale or IPO of the business, thus giving investors a degree of downside protection but full participation in the upside). Such investments are totally illiquid unless there is a realization event such as a sale of the business, which may take many years. Venture capital investing is a very risky area requiring specialized skills and generally should be avoided by anyone who cannot afford to lose all of their investment in a given company.&lt;ref name="VT" /&gt;

{{for|additional information|wikipedia:Certificate of deposit}}

A '''certificate of deposit''' (CD) is a debt instrument issued by a bank or a credit union. A CD has a fixed interest rate, for a fixed period, and paid monthly, quarterly, or annually. CDs at credit unions are sometimes called '''money market certificates'''. Unlike a [[Money markets | money market fund]], there is no credit risk with a money market certificate as long as you stay within the [[deposit insurance]] guarantee.

You can also consider CDs as a form of [[Bond basics|bond]]. For more on this, see [[CDs vs bonds]].

==Role in a portfolio==
The main reasons you might use CDs are:
* A general savings account. If you know the date on which you need a large amount of cash (for example, to buy a car, for college tuition, for a vacation, and so on), you might consider opening a CD that will mature just before that date.
* A part of your fixed income allocation in a retirement portfolio. CDs are simply bonds with special characteristics; see [[CDs vs bonds]] for more. [[Laddering bonds or CDs | Laddering]] is a common way to hold CDs in a portfolio.

==Risks==

===Credit risk===
If you use them correctly, CDs do not have credit risk. Only bank accounts and [[Treasury bond| treasury bonds]] share this enormously valuable feature of a government guarantee.

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insures CDs from qualified bank. The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) insures CDs from qualified credit unions. You can verify that the institution you are buying from is covered by FDIC or NCUA by checking their status:
* FDIC: [https://banks.data.fdic.gov/bankfind-suite/ BankFind Suite]
* NCUA: [https://mapping.ncua.gov/ResearchCreditUnion Research a Credit Union]

The standard insurance amount is $250,000 per depositor, per insured bank, for each account ownership category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.fdic.gov/resources/deposit-insurance/understanding-deposit-insurance/| title=FDIC: Understanding Deposit Insurance| publisher=FDIC| accessdate=August 26, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If you want to safely invest more than $250,000 at the same institution, you can do this using payable-on-death (POD) labeling. For example, a couple with two children can insure $2.5&amp;nbsp;million. They would hold a joint CD with $500,000, an individual CD each, three CDs for her POD for each of him, child one and child two; and three CDs for him POD each of her, child one and child two. Details are at the [https://www.depositaccounts.com/blog/more-about-extending-fdic-and-ncua.html Bankdeals blog] and the [https://www.fdic.gov/resources/deposit-insurance/understanding-deposit-insurance/#revocable FDIC]. The FDIC Insurance Electronic Deposit Insurance Estimator ([https://edie.fdic.gov/ EDIE]) can help make sure you do this right.

Banks fail regularly and so it is critical to take these rules seriously. Do not ever buy CDs greater than the insurance guarantee or at a non-guaranteed institution. In particular, there are a small number of credit unions that are not insured by the NCUA. Even if these credit unions offered slightly higher rates on their CDs (and they generally do not), it is not worth losing the government guarantee. If you have large amounts of money to invest in CDs, investigate the private [[wikipedia:IntraFi Network|IntraFi Network]],&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Formerly [[wikipedia:Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service|Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service]] (CDARS). Reconfigured into [[wikipedia:IntraFi Network|IntraFi Network]] in 2021.&lt;/ref&gt; which automatically distributes your money across a large number of institutions.

===Inflation risk===
CDs are effectively nominal [[Bond basics | bonds]] and have inflation risk. The bank promises that you will receive the stated interest payments for the life of the CD, and the principal at maturity, but there is no guarantee that the future dollars will be worth as much as present dollars. (Also, in the case of bank failure, the FDIC only guarantees return of your principal and accumulated interest; sometimes the new bank that takes over the CD cuts the interest rate.)
 
You can partially mitigate inflation risk by redeeming CD prior to its maturity date. Early redemption creates a penalty, in the form reduction in the accrued interest. However, depending on market conditions, such as higher interest rates, it can be beneficial for you to redeem an existing CD early (known as "breaking" the CD) so that you can then use a more attractive alternative. For more, see: [[Comparing CDs]].

===Early withdrawal penalty===
[[File:Form1099-INT.gif|thumb|500px|Figure 1. Form 1099-INT]]
If you need money in your CD before it matures, or wish to redeem the CD early to reinvest at higher rates, you may have to pay an early withdrawal penalty. According to a survey conducted by Bankrate.com,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.bankrate.com/brm/news/investing/20061208_cd_early_withdrawal_main_a1.asp| title=CD early withdrawal penalties survey| publisher=Bankrate.com| date=December 8, 2006| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070102000354/http://www.bankrate.com/brm/news/investing/20061208_cd_early_withdrawal_main_a1.asp| archive-date=January 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; early withdrawal penalties vary widely. The most common penalties are three months and six months of interest.

Usually you report the full interest payment from a CD as taxable income. The early withdrawal penalty is deductible as an adjustment to income on a federal income tax return. Box 2 of your 1099-INT form (see Figure 1) will show the early withdrawal penalty. 

==Taxation==
If you hold them in a taxable account, interest from CDs is taxed federally as ordinary income. Unlike money market funds, there are no tax-exempt CDs. Taxation at the state level varies. Some states may exempt interest from in-state banks.

==Buying CDs==
When buying CDs, there is a trade-off between convenience and yield. You have a few options.

=== Your local bank or credit union ===
When you save money for a specific future cash need, it can be simplest to purchase a CD with money from your checking account. These rates are always better than checking account interest, but often are not very good. Also, beware of "teaser" rates that automatically roll-over into much lower yielding CDs when they mature. You often have just ten days or so to stop a roll-over, so be sure to mark your calendar.

=== Out of town banks or credit unions ===
Different banks and credit unions around the country are constantly offering special deals to attract new customers. If you are willing to fill out the paperwork, you can get the highest yield CDs by moving your money to whichever bank is offering the best deal as your old CD matures. Many banks now offer online setup and ACH money transfers, although the paperwork to move an IRA is often more difficult.

The best source for finding bank deals is at [https://www.depositaccounts.com/ DepositAccounts.com]. There, you can see a list of all deals available for the length CD you want. Many deals are only for residents of certain states or cities, or people affiliated to some employer or group.

===Brokered CDs===
{{Warning| Brokered CDs are designed to be held until maturity.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Consider the maturity date carefully when purchasing a brokered CD for an IRA. If you have to make a [[Required Minimum Distribution]] before maturity, you would need to sell the CD. See this {{Forum link|p=2284513|title= Re: Can you lose money by buying CDs?| author=LadyGeek| date=September 7, 2019}}.&lt;/ref&gt; You can sell CDs before maturity on the secondary market (which may be limited). All brokered CDs will fluctuate in value between purchase and maturity. As a result, you could see a substantial gain or loss on any CD sold before maturity. A brokered CD's value can decline because of rising interest rates, and longer maturities have higher interest rate risk. See {{forum link| t=152258| title=Vanguard cd question &lt;nowiki&gt;[Brokered CDs]&lt;/nowiki&gt;}} for additional information. Ask in the forum if you are unsure.}}
Brokers sometimes negotiate a higher interest rate on bank-issued CDs because they can bring a large amount of deposits to the bank. But CDs sold by brokers can be complex, and may carry more risks than traditional CDs sold directly by banks, especially your ability to lock in an attractive interest rate or get your money back early.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.fdic.gov/consumers/consumer/news/cnspr13/cdsfrombrokers.html| title=When a Broker Offers a Bank CD: It Pays to Do Some Research| publisher=FDIC| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230331212715/https://www.fdic.gov/consumers/consumer/news/cnspr13/cdsfrombrokers.html| archive-date=March 31, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sec"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.sec.gov/reportspubs/investor-publications/investorpubscertific| title=High-Yield CDs – Protect Your Money by Checking the Fine Print| publisher=SEC| date=December 3, 2008| accessdate=August 26, 2023}} See the ''Special Considerations for Brokered CDs'' section.&lt;/ref&gt;

Federal deposit insurance is limited to a total aggregate amount of $250,000 for each depositor in each bank or thrift institution. It is therefore very important that you know which institution issued your CD. Find out where your broker plans to deposit your money; they might put it into a bank or thrift where you already have CDs or other deposits. If the brokered CD increases your total deposits with that institution above the $250,000 federal deposit insurance limit, you would no longer be fully insured.&lt;ref name="sec"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Good account records by your deposit broker can ensure your CD will have federal deposit insurance and, if a bank closes, you will be paid quickly. Unlike traditional bank CDs, brokered CDs are sometimes held by a group of unrelated investors. Instead of owning the entire CD, each investor owns a portion of the total. Confirm with your broker how your CD is held, and be sure to ask for a copy of the exact title of the CD. If several investors own the CD, the deposit broker will probably not list each person's name in the title. But you should make sure that the account records reflect that the broker is merely acting as an agent for you and the other owners (for example, "XYZ Brokerage as Custodian for Customers"). This will ensure that your portion of the CD qualifies for full federal deposit insurance coverage.&lt;ref name="sec" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{forum link| t=49200| title=Brokered Deposits / CDs -- Proper Documentation| date=January 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A brokered CD may not reinvest the interest payments, such as depositing the money into a separate [[money market]] account. In this case, the CD's interest rate is calculated as simple interest (the same amount every payment period). The total return of the CD should include the interest paid by the separate account.

====Vanguard Brokerage Services====

Vanguard and other brokerage firms offer brokered CDs from hundreds of different banks. All CDs available through [https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/cds Vanguard Brokerage Service] are FDIC or NCUA insured (though you must stay below the limits). Brokers deposits interest payments (which are often made monthly) into the money market linked to your brokerage account.

The downside is that the very best deals are not available as brokered CDs. You will generally do better than your local bank, but not as well as if you search out the very best deals.

'''Series EE Savings Bonds''' (often called '''EE Bonds''') are government savings bonds issued by the U.S. Treasury. First issued in 1980 as a replacement for the series E Savings Bonds, they have been offered ever since, though the rules applying to the bonds have changed several times. EE Bonds issued after May 2005 earn a fixed rate of interest based on the issue date of the bond. Other forms of treasury securities include [[I savings bonds]] and [[TIPS]].

==Rates and terms==
The rules governing EE Savings Bonds are complex, and have been changed several times since they were first issued. For more information, see [http://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/research/indepth/ebonds/res_e_bonds_eeratesandterms.htm EE/E Bonds Rates &amp; Terms] from TreasuryDirect. To find out what your bonds are worth today, use the [http://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/tools/tools_savingsbondcalc.htm Savings Bond Calculator] or the [http://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/tools/tools_savingsbondwizard.htm Savings Bond Wizard].

===Bonds issued after May 2005===
EE Bonds issued after May 2005 earn a fixed rate in effect at the time of purchase. They must be held for a minimum of one year. Bonds redeemed within five years must pay a 3-month interest penalty. They are guaranteed to double in value in 20 years, which equals a guaranteed return of 3.5% a year. For more information, see [http://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/research/indepth/ebonds/res_e_bonds_eeratesandterms.htm#may2005 rates and terms] from TreasuryDirect.

===Bonds issued between May 1997 and April 2005===
EE Bonds issued between May 1997 and April 2005 earn 90% of the average yields on 5-year Treasury notes for the preceding six months. The rate is adjusted every six months. Bonds redeemed within five years must pay a 3-month interest penalty. EE Bonds issued between May 1995 and May 2003 are guaranteed to double in value in 17 years, which equals a guaranteed return of 4.16% a year. EE Bonds issued after June 1, 2003 are guaranteed to double in value in 20 years, which equals a guaranteed return of 3.5% a year. For more information, see [http://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/research/indepth/ebonds/res_e_bonds_eeratesandterms_eebondsissued051995_042005.htm#may97 rates and terms] from TreasuryDirect.

===Bonds issued between May 1995 and April 1997===
EE Bonds issued between May 1995 and April 1997 earn a short-term rate in the first five years. Between five years and 17 years, the bonds earn a long-term rate. They are guaranteed to double in value in 17 years, which equals a guaranteed return of 4.16% a year. After 17-years, they earn the rates in effect at that time. For more information, see [http://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/research/indepth/ebonds/res_e_bonds_eeratesandterms_eebondsissued051995_042005.htm#may95 rates and terms] from TreasuryDirect.

===Bonds issued before May 1995===
Before May 1995, all EE Bonds issued earned a graduated, fixed rate of interest for the first five years. After five years and until the maturity date, the bonds earned either the guaranteed minimum rate (determined by the date of issue) or a market-based rate, whichever was higher. For more information, see [http://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/research/indepth/ebonds/res_e_bonds_eeratesandterms_eebondsissuedbefore051995.htm rates and terms] from TreasuryDirect.

==Features==
As of January 1, 2012, paper savings bonds are no longer sold. This action supports Treasury’s goal to increase the number of electronic transactions with citizens and businesses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treasurydirect.gov/news/pressroom/pressroom_comotcend0711.htm Treasury to End Over-the-Counter Sales of Paper U.S. Savings Bonds], TreasuryDirect, July 13, 2011, Viewed September 21, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Electronic versions of EE Bonds are available, limited to $10,000 per year per Social Security Number. Savings bonds purchased as gifts aren't included in your annual limit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/research/articles/res_invest_articles_purchaselimits_0406.htm Purchase Limits], from TreasuryDirect.gov.&lt;/ref&gt;
* EE Bonds are not marketable securities, meaning that, unlike other bonds and stocks, you cannot trade EE Bonds in the secondary market.
* EE Bonds are free from state and local taxation. (See below.)

==Where to purchase==
You can buy electronic EE Bonds at [http://www.savingsbonds.gov/indiv/indiv.htm TreasuryDirect].

==How to redeem==
Those wishing to redeem paper savings bonds should first check their financial institution for redemption instructions. Bonds can also be redeemed by mail at the Treasury Retail Securities Site.

Paper bonds can also be converted to electronic form.

Bonds which have not matured, but were lost, stolen or destroyed, must have them reissued in electronic form.

See [http://www.savingsbonds.gov/indiv/products/prod_eebonds_glance.htm Series EE Savings Bonds] for complete details.

==Taxes==
EE Savings Bonds are not subject to state or local taxes, and all federal taxes can be deferred until redemption or the end of the extended maturity period.

===Tax-free growth for qualified education expenses===

If EE Bonds issued after 1989 are redeemed for qualifying education expenses, the interest is completely tax free, provided certain conditions are met. According to [http://www.irs.gov/publications/p970/ch10.html IRS Publication 970, Tax Benefits for Education], the tax-free redemption requires the following conditions to be met:

* You pay qualified educational expenses for yourself, your spouse, or a dependent for whom you claim an exemption on your return.
* Your modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) is less than $92,200 ($145,750 if married filing jointly or qualifying widow(er)).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/uac/about-form-8815 |title=Form 8815, Exclusion of Interest From Series EE and I U.S. Savings Bonds Issued After 1989 |author= IRS |date=Aug 29, 2016 |website=|access-date=18 September 2016}}, Viewed 18-September 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; You cannot exclude any of the interest if your modified adjusted gross income is equal to or more than the upper limit. The phaseout, if any, is figured for you when you fill out [http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f8815.pdf Form 8815]. The MAGI thresholds are adjusted annually.
* Your filing status is not married filing separately.
* The bond must be issued either in your name (as the sole owner) or in the name of both you and your spouse (as co-owners).
* The owner of the Savings Bonds must be at least 24 years old before the bond's issue date. (The issue date is printed on the front of the Savings Bond.)
* The full proceeds of the savings bond redemption (both interest and principal) must be used for qualifying educational expenses.i
Note that redeeming EE Bonds to contribute to a [[529 plan]] or a [[Coverdell Education Savings Accounts (ESAs)|Coverdell education savings account]] is also considered a qualified educational expense. See [http://www.irs.gov/publications/p970/ch10.html Publication 970 (2010), Tax Benefits for Education] for more details.

==Redeeming EE savings bonds==
EE Savings Bonds must be held for 12 months before they can be redeemed; an exception may apply if the bondholder is affected by a disaster such as a flood, fire, hurricane, or tornado.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/research/indepth/ebonds/res_e_bonds_eeredeem_disaster.htm Individual - Redeem or Replace Bonds in Areas Affected by Disaster], Treasury Direct, viewed 2 February 2014. &lt;/ref&gt;

EE Bonds redeemed before five years will lose the last three months of interest.

EE Bonds earn interest for 30 years. After 30 years EE bonds stop earning interest and should be redeemed.

The bonds can be redeemed by following the instructions at TreasuryDirect: [https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/research/indepth/ebonds/res_e_bonds_eeredeem.htm Redeeming (Cashing) EE and E Savings Bonds].

==Role in a portfolio==
An ideal use &lt;nowiki&gt;[in a portfolio]&lt;/nowiki&gt; is to help you to defer taking [[Social Security]]. A rule of thumb is that each year you delay retirement and the onset of your Social Security payments will increase your benefits by 8%. If you buy a $10,000 savings bond each year starting at age 42, you assure yourself $20,000 in annual income beginning at age 62. That can help tide you over until you reach 70, when Social Security payments max out.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2016/09/16/uncle-sam-pays-almost-twice-the-yield-on-treasurys-if-you-know-where-to-look/|title=Uncle Sam Pays Almost Twice the Yield on Treasurys — If You Know Where to Look |last1=Zweig |first1= Jason |date=September 16, 2016 |publisher= Wall Street Journal|access-date=September 18, 2016}} Also see this {{Forum post|t=199723|title="Uncle Sam Pays Almost Twice The Yield On Treasurys--If You Know Where To Look}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''{{PAGENAME}}''', for investment purposes, is usually held in the form of bullion coins or in a gold bullion [[exchange-traded fund]] (ETF). Gold company stocks can be held individually, or in a gold stocks [[mutual fund]] or ETF.

==Gold investments==

===Bullion coins===
Examples of popular bullion coins minted by the United States, Canada, and South Africa are illustrated below.

*[http://www.gold-trust.com/ Central GoldTrust (GTU)] (Closed-end fund)

===Gold stocks and mutual funds===
* See [[Precious metals equity]] page which has different characteristics than gold bullion.

==Taxation==
Gold Bullion and gold bullion ETFs are subject to the maximum 28% capital gains tax on collectibles. This tax rate is higher than the maximum capital gains tax  of 15% on other investment assets. However, in some cases, such as with GTU, gains can be taxed as capital gains because the investment can be treated as a [[passive foreign investment company]] (PFIC) - see a tax adviser for details.

==Gold prices==
Before 1968, the price of gold was relatively stable, with few major fluctuations. From 1968-1978 fundamental changes were made to the global monetary system and gold's treatment in the United States, potentially changing gold's role as an asset class.&lt;ref name="suggestion"&gt;{{Forum post|title = Re: Suggestions for the Wiki|p = 4878884|author = pepys| date = Dec 08, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968, the "gold pool" system, where central banks traded on the private market to control the price of gold, was ended, resulting in the price of gold diverging from the official price. The United States stopped allowing the convertibility of the dollar to gold in 1971 and officially ended it in 1973.&lt;ref name="suggestion" /&gt;

Gold was re-legalized for Americans to own and trade in 1975. In 1978, the official price of gold was finally removed. During and after these changes, the real price of gold has been highly volatile.&lt;ref name="suggestion" /&gt;

The following table provides annual gold prices (including high and low prices) starting in 1970.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' shows how you can combine funds to mimic the composition of the international stock market. Funds can be [[mutual fund]]s, [[index fund]]s or [[exchange-traded fund]]s (ETFs).

Investors who want to invest in the Vanguard Total International Stock Market Index Fund often face a situation where they have to approximate it with the funds available in their employer sponsored plans, perhaps also using funds in other accounts, for example a [[Roth IRA]]. [[Thrift Savings Plan]] investors, for example, face this issue with the [[I Fund]] (based on [[MSCI EAFE index]]), which lacks [[Emerging market stocks|emerging markets]], [[International Small-Cap|small-cap]] stocks, and Canadian stocks.

==Total international stock market index==
This table shows Total International Stock Market Index Funds from two providers. The aim is to approximate these [[Approximating total stock market#Stock market classifications| stock style boxes]] using available funds chosen from the two-fund and EAFE tables below.

Developed and emerging market [[Emerging market stocks#Emerging market indexes| country classifications]] vary depending on the index provider.&lt;ref name=dev-emg&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.spglobal.com/en/research-insights/articles/is-south-korea-crowding-your-emerging-markets-allocation|title= Is South Korea crowding your emerging markets allocation?|publisher=S&amp;P Global|date=November 24, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, it is best if you use both funds from the same provider, as shown in the last three examples above.

==Approximating total international stock with an EAFE fund==
These examples were designed specifically if you need to use a [[MSCI EAFE index| Europe, Australasia and Far East (EAFE)]] index fund, such as the [[I Fund|TSP I Fund]] or the [https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/products/swisx Schwab International Index Fund (SWISX)].

The [[MSCI EAFE index]] does not include:
* [[Emerging market stocks|Emerging markets]]
* [[International small cap|International small-caps]]
* Canadian stocks

You may want to use one of the two boxes depending on whether you have access to an [[MSCI]] or [[FTSE Emerging Index|FTSE]] emerging markets index fund. MSCI classifies South Korea as an emerging market, while FTSE considers it a developed market&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ftserussell.com/blogs/south-korea-developed-or-emerging |title= South Korea: Developed or Emerging?|publisher= FTSE Russell|date= February 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;; this is why box 2 uses a separate South Korea index fund. 

The blended [[expense ratio]]s of the two boxes are 0.10% and 0.12% respectively, assuming that the [https://www.tsp.gov/funds-individual/i-fund/?tab=fees I Fund (0.055%)] takes the place of the MSCI EAFE index fund. You can reduce the expense ratios by using the [https://www.franklintempleton.com/investor/investments-and-solutions/investment-options/etfs/overview/26364/franklin-ftse-canada-etf/FLCA Franklin FTSE Canada ETF (FLCA)] (0.09%) and [https://www.franklintempleton.com/investor/investments-and-solutions/investment-options/etfs/overview/26353/franklin-ftse-south-korea-etf-/FLKR  Franklin FTSE South Korea ETF (FLKR)] (0.09%). These are smaller and more lightly traded than their iShares equivalents, meaning a larger [[bid/ask spread]], but they have much lower expense ratios.

To hold the portfolio in box 1 in the recommended percentage, using the Admiral Class share of the [{{Vf | vfsax}} Vanguard FTSE All-World ex-US Small Cap Index Fund (VFSAX)], the minimum amount you would need for all four funds together is $30,000. This is because 10% of that amount equals the $3,000 fund minimum for VFSAX. Of that $30,000, at least $12,600 must be in the IRA to hold the three funds, with the remaining $17,400 in the I Fund.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;For an older version of the weightings and price calculation, see the [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AueLhNpKZa4XdDdDVEFiZlJKWHlEUFJFVzJBaVlqakE Vanguard Total International Stock Market replication with I Fund] Google Spreadsheet.&lt;/ref&gt; You can avoid this by owning ETF share classes of the Vanguard FTSE All-World ex-US Small Cap Index.

==Canadian investors==

For Canadians, most [[finiki:Registered Retirement Savings Plan|Registered Retirement Savings Plans]] have a brokerage function that let you purchase of securities based in the United States. Consider investing in '''[{{Vf | 3141}} Vanguard Total World Stock Index ETF]''' which samples securities from throughout the entire investable world market. You could then use '''[https://www.vanguardcanada.ca/individual/etfs/etfs-detail-overview.htm?portId=9554 Vanguard MSCI Canada Index ETF]''' and '''[http://ca.ishares.com/product_info/fund/overview/XMD.htm iShares S&amp;P/TSX Completion Index Fund]''' to balance to your desired domestic exposure.

== Methodology ==

All the above collections of funds were weighted in a manner to approximate the Morningstar Style Box, average market cap, and [[#Region and sector comparison|industry and regional weightings]] of the [{{Vf | vxus}} Vanguard Total International Stock ETF (VXUS) (0.08%)].&lt;ref name="Xray" /&gt;

The collection of funds making up the first box in the EAFE table is weighted in the following way:

* '''Small-cap stocks''' are weighted at 10% per [[Vanguard_FTSE_All-World_ex-US_Small-Cap_Index_Fund#Total_Market_Replication|Vanguard FTSE All-World ex-US Small-Cap Index]].
* '''Canadian stocks''' are 6.6% of Vanguard's Total International Stock ETF&lt;ref name="VXUS Portfolio"&gt;{{cite web |url={{Vf | vxus}} |title=Vanguard Total International Stock ETF (VXUS) Portfolio &amp; Management |publisher=Vanguard |date=April 30, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 14.8% of Vanguard's FTSE All-World ex-US Small Cap ETF.&lt;ref name="VSS Portfolio"&gt;{{cite web |url={{Vf | vss}} |title=Vanguard FTSE All-World ex-US Small-Cap ETF (VSS) Portfolio &amp; Management |publisher=Vanguard |date=April 30, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given that Vanguard's international small cap fund overlaps the total international market fund, it was decided to weight the Canadian MSCI fund at 5% of the overall collection of funds (which is 6.6% - (14.8% * 10%)).
* '''Emerging markets''' (per MSCI) are 29.6% of Vanguard's Total International Stock ETF,{{#tag:ref|29.6% = 25.5% FTSE emerging markets + 4.1% South Korea.&lt;ref name="VXUS Portfolio"/&gt;|group=note}} and are 28.3% of the Vanguard FTSE All-World ex-US Small-Cap ETF.{{#tag:ref|28.3% = 23.4% FTSE emerging markets + 4.9% South Korea.&lt;ref name="VSS Portfolio" /&gt;|group=note}} Given that these funds overlap, the MSCI Emerging Markets ETF was weighted at 27% (which is 29.6% - (28.3% * 10%)).
* '''Europe, Australasia, and the Far East (EAFE)''' is everything left over, which is 58%. The '''MSCI EAFE index fund''' is a proxy for the I Fund, Schwab International Index Fund (SWISX) or any MSCI EAFE fund.

== Region and sector comparison ==

When Vanguard's International Total Stock ETF and the collection of funds were compared in Morningstar's X-Ray's different measurements, both were similar. For example, X-Ray compared the geographic regions as (rounded to the nearest 1%):

These are Vanguard's three broad international index funds. Any of the three is a good core international holding, and all are eligible for the [[foreign tax credit]], should have very low capital gains, making them suitable for taxable accounts. You might also add Vanguard Emerging Markets Index Fund if you hold Developed Markets Index (or a non-Vanguard international fund) which has no emerging markets.

==Region breakdown==
As of 2025, the regional breakdown for three Vanguard international funds is shown below.

'''Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities''' (TIPS) are one type of the notes and bonds issued by the [https://home.treasury.gov/ U.S. Treasury]. TIPS are unique because their principal and interest payments are indexed to the rate of inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index.

TIPS explicitly protect you from inflation. Other "nominal" bonds do not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/research/indepth/tips/res_tips.htm| publisher=Treasury Direct| title=TIPS In Depth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Notice|[[I savings bonds]] (I Bonds) also protect you from inflation, and are an alternative to TIPS. See [[I Bonds vs TIPS]] for similarities and differences between the the two.}}

== How it works ==
After a TIPS bond is issued, its principal is adjusted daily using the ''Non-Seasonally Adjusted U.S. City Average All Items Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers'' ([https://www.bls.gov/CPI/ CPI-U]). If there is inflation, the adjusted principal goes up. If there is deflation, the adjusted principal goes down.

When the bond matures, the [https://home.treasury.gov/ U.S. Treasury] pays the original or the adjusted principal, whichever is greater. The principal adjustment factor is called the Index Ratio. The adjusted principal is the original principal multiplied by the Index Ratio.

After the CPI-U number is announced for the previous month, the Treasury Department publishes the [https://treasurydirect.gov/instit/annceresult/tipscpi/tipscpi.htm daily index ratios] for the following month. For example, the CPI-U number for May is announced in June. The inflation during the month of May is prorated in the Index Ratios throughout the month of July and reflected fully in the Index Ratio by the end of July. Therefore the inflation adjustment has a lag of two months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/research/indepth/tips/res_tips_rates.htm| publisher=Treasury Direct| title=TIPS Rates &amp; Terms}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like regular bonds, a TIPS bond also pays interest twice a year. The semi-annual interest is calculated by multiplying the adjusted principal by one-half of the interest rate on the bond. For example, if a TIPS bond has a stated interest rate of 2% and the index ratio is 1.035 on the date of the interest payment date, a $1,000 bond will pay interest of

 $1,000 &amp;times; 1.035 &amp;times; 2% / 2 = $10.35

If the index ratio goes to 1.050 on the next interest payment date six months later, the same bond will pay interest of

 $1,000 &amp;times; 1.050 &amp;times; 2% / 2 = $10.50

If the index ratio goes to 0.985 on the next interest payment date another six months later, the same bond will pay interest of

 $1,000 &amp;times; 0.985 &amp;times; 2% / 2 = $9.85

When there is inflation, both the TIPS principal and the interest payments go up with inflation. When there is deflation, both the TIPS principal and the interest payments go down with deflation. On maturity, if the inflation adjusted principal value is below the original face value, the TIPS pays the original face value. 

== Role in a portfolio ==
TIPS belong to the Bonds category. Their role in a portfolio is similar to that of other bonds. Because unexpected inflation is the biggest enemy of fixed income securities and because TIPS offer unique inflation protection, consider including TIPS in your investment portfolio.

A TIPS should work as a good diversifier of equity risk, because it (and the inflation) tends to have slightly negative correlation with equities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.tiaa-cref.org/about/press/publications/market_monitor/2008_08_25.pdf| publisher=TIAA-CREF| title=Inflation-Linked Bonds: Powerful Portfolio Diversifier}}{{dead link}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, even though both conventional treasuries and TIPS should respond to changes in real interest rates, during market crashes or severe recessions, TIPS may not hold up as well as conventional treasuries, at least in the short term&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/102215/3-reasons-stay-away-tips.asp 3 Reasons to Maybe Avoid Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS)]&lt;/ref&gt;.  This could be because conventional US treasuries are often considered a [https://files.stlouisfed.org/files/htdocs/publications/regional/10/07/treasury_securities.pdf flight to safety] during financial uncertainty.  Also, conventional treasuries are more liquid than TIPS&lt;ref&gt;[https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/221/TBACCharge1Q42021.pdf TIPS Supply]&lt;/ref&gt;.

[https://blbarnitz4.wordpress.com/2016/12/04/a-three-fund-portfolio-tailored-for-stable-retirement-spending/#more-4071 TIPS can also be incorporated into a three fund portfolio, instead of nominal bonds].

==TIPS Ladder==
A [https://www.tipsladder.com/ TIPS ladder] is a series of Treasury Inflation Protected Security bonds, purchased with sequential maturities for a specific number of years.  For instance, an investor could purchase a series TIPS maturing in 2025 to 2034, for a 10 year ladder, with each year representing a specific maturity amount, such as $10,000.  Those maturity amounts will increase by inflation each year.  The net result is a fixed period ladder of maturities protected against inflation.  Given TIPS also have a real yield, positive or negative, the face values needed to achieve the desired maturity values can vary.

One example of a TIPS ladder could be creating a ladder for the years between retiring early and eventually drawing social security.  A 60 year old retiree may decide to create a 10 year TIPS ladder until age 70 when they take delayed social security.  The annual ladder amounts could approximate the estimated future social security payments. 

In periods where the real yield on TIPS is significantly positive, a TIPS ladder is a way of guaranteeing an inflation protected cash flow stream with a positive rate of return.

== How to buy ==
The Treasury Department sells TIPS a few times a year through auctions. After the auction, TIPS trade on the secondary market. You can buy TIPS at the time of the auction or you can buy on the secondary market at any time. You can also buy TIPS through a mutual fund or ETF.

=== At auction ===
&lt;!-- '''Note''': ''The Treasury auction process is not unique to TIPS. The following few paragraphs should be moved to a new article about buying Treasury notes at auction.'' --&gt;

If you want to buy TIPS directly from the Treasury, you need to do so during one of their auctions. As of 2019, this is the expected auction schedule (where months marked with an asterisk indicate re-openings of the prior issue):

* '''5-year TIPS''' - April, June*, October, December*
* '''10-year TIPS''' - January, March*, May*, July, September*, November*
* '''30-year TIPS''' - February, August*

The [https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/quarterly-refunding/Documents/auctions.pdf Tentative Treasury Auction Schedule] publishes specific auction dates. A few days before the auction date, the Treasury Department also publishes a formal [https://treasurydirect.gov/instit/annceresult/press/press_secannpr.htm announcement]. The announcement includes details of the security being offered. If it is a new issue, the auction sets both the price and the coupon interest rate. The coupon rate is set to nearest 0.125% below the high yield from the auction. If it is a re-opening, the coupon interest rate is already known. The auction will set the yield which in turn determines the price. This [https://sheet.zoho.com/public.do?docurl=s0%2FmWFqPNrZy0%2FOUr%2FsJjA%3D%3D&amp;name=M0Uaf%2FFaFrhTmtwytaDqkQ%3D%3D online spreadsheet] can help you estimate the dollars needed for buying one bond at auction.

After the announcement date but before the auction cutoff time, retail investors can place auction orders through [https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/indiv.htm TreasuryDirect] or through a brokerage account. [https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/indiv.htm TreasuryDirect] charges no fee but it only handles taxable accounts. If you want to buy in an IRA, you must use a brokerage account, which can also handle taxable accounts. As of September 2023, [https://www.fidelity.com/trading/commissions-margin-rates Fidelity], [https://www.schwab.com/fixed-income/individual-bonds#FixedIncome Schwab], and [[Vanguard_FAQ#Vanguard_Brokerage_Services_.28VBS.29 | Vanguard Brokerage Services]] charge no fee for TIPS auction orders placed online.

After the auction, the Treasury Department makes [https://treasurydirect.gov/instit/annceresult/press/press_auctionresults.htm another announcement] for the auction result. The settlement date is at least one day after the auction date. You must have enough cash available on the settlement date to pay for the bonds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/research/indepth/res_auctions_indepth.htm| publisher=Treasury Direct| title=Auctions In Depth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== On the secondary market ===
You can also buy TIPS at any time on the secondary market through a brokerage account. The prices from the brokers include a markup over what institutions pay for larger trades. Some brokers also charge a separate commission on top of the markup. TreasuryDirect does not handle secondary market purchases; you have to transfer your bonds to a brokerage and sell them there.

The following link shows some current TIPS pricing and real yields available in the secondary market.
*[https://www.wsj.com/market-data/bonds/tips Treasury Inflation Protected Securities: WSJ Markets]

=== Through a mutual fund or ETF ===
Buying TIPS through a mutual fund or ETF gives you a diversified portfolio of TIPS of different maturities. Buying through a mutual fund or ETF also makes it easier for tax reporting and reinvesting interest payments. Because a mutual fund or ETF distributes both the interest income and inflation adjustment of an inflation-indexed bond as income distributions, there are some things you need to be aware of:
#If you want full inflation protection, you need to reinvest inflation adjustment distributions back into the fund.
#The inflation/deflation principal adjustment causes fund dividend distributions to vary considerably.&lt;ref group="note"&gt; You can see an example of this in the early 2009 distributions from the Vanguard Inflation-Protected Securities Fund. The semiannual report contains the following explanation:
{{quotation|
'''Why the fund skipped a dividend'''&lt;br&gt;
The income distributions from Vanguard Inflation-Protected Securities Fund are based on the sum of two factors. One is the real yield at which the fund securities were purchased (the "real purchased yield"). The other is the inflation adjustment to the value of these holdings, which is based on monthly changes in the Consumer Price Index. A rise in the index (inflation) increases the principal value of those holdings. Together with the "real purchased yield," this upward adjustment is distributed as income, as required by the Internal Revenue Service. A decline (deflation) reduces the principal value, partially or fully offsetting the real yield. ... [L]ate 2008 was a period of significantly falling prices, or deflation. The inflation-related adjustments to the value of inflation-indexed securities are made with a two-month lag, so the significant deflation experienced in late 2008 offset all of (a bit more than, in fact) the fund’s "real purchased yield" accrued in the first half of 2009. The inflation rate has since crept into positive territory.|Vanguard Inflation-Protected Securities Fund 2009 Semiannual Report, p.5.}}

== Tax considerations ==
TIPS are not as tax-efficient as their low reported yields indicate. Both the inflation adjustment to principal and the interest payments are taxable as ordinary income for federal income tax. They are tax exempt for state and local income tax. Thus TIPS are as tax-efficient as nominal Treasury bonds with the same combined yield&lt;ref&gt;Excepting for the fact that TIPS inflation adjustment is taxed annually, but is not paid out until maturity.

&lt;/ref&gt;; if inflation is low and the TIPS yields are low, the tax cost will also be low.

If you must hold inflation indexed bonds in a taxable account, you may also consider [[I savings bonds]]; the tax deferral is likely to be worth more than the yield difference. However, if you have maxed out on I Savings Bonds, and need to hold bonds in a taxable account, TIPS tend to have low yields because they have low risk, so they may be reasonable taxable holdings.

If you hold individual TIPS in a taxable account, both the inflation adjustment to principal and the interest payments are taxable as ordinary income for federal income tax, although the bonds do not pay out the inflation adjustment to principal until the maturity date. This problem of paying taxes on income not received until a future date is often referred to as the "[https://tipswatch.com/2021/04/02/frightened-by-a-phantom-tips-are-fine-in-a-taxable-account-until/ phantom income]" problem. You must figure out how to report taxable income on your own using the 1099 forms you receive from [https://treasurydirect.gov/ TreasuryDirect] or your brokerage firm.

If you hold TIPS through a mutual fund or ETF in a taxable account, the mutual fund or ETF will figure out and distribute the taxable income to you as dividends. Tax reporting is similar to other Treasury bond funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/research/indepth/tips/res_tips_tax.htm| publisher=Treasury Direct| title=TIPS: Tax Considerations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Why are the yields sometimes negative?==
TIPS may sometimes report a negative [[Bonds: advanced topics#Yield to maturity|''yield to maturity'']].

A bond's ''yield to maturity'' can be thought of as the interest rate a savings account would have to pay in order for you to end up with the same amount of money at the time the bond matures.&lt;ref name="#Cruncher"&gt;{{forum link| p=1176308| title=Please help me understand Vanguard Inflation-Protected Fund| author=#Cruncher| date=September 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, you buy a [[Nominal bond | nominal bond]] for $1,000 with a 2% coupon paid annually that matures in one year. At that time you'll receive $20 in interest plus $1,000 in principal for a total of $1,020. This is the same as you'd get from a savings account paying 2% compounded annually.

But say that because of market conditions, you'd have to pay $1,005 for the ''same bond''. After one year, you will still receive $1,020. What is the equivalent savings account interest rate? It would be:

:1.49% = ($1,020 / $1,005) - 1

Now assume market conditions are such that the price of the bond is $1,025. What savings account interest rate would make $1,025 "grow" to $1,020 in one year? It would have to be a negative interest rate. In this case:

:-0.49% = ($1,020 / $1,025) - 1

Savings accounts and ''nominal bonds'' rarely pay a negative interest rate.

But, TIPS are more likely to have a negative real ''yield to maturity'' because investors know they will get an additional return to compensate for inflation.

Assume the bond costing $1,025 is a TIPS, and that the [[Consumer price index | CPI]] increases 3% during the year. Investors will get $1,051 = ($1,020 &amp;times; 1.03) a year from now, so they will have a positive nominal return.&lt;ref name="#Cruncher" /&gt;

'''{{PAGENAME}}''', also called '''junk bonds''', are bonds (corporate, municipal, or foreign) with low credit quality. These companies are at much greater risk of default than higher quality credits and, as a result, pay higher coupon interest rates than comparable high quality corporate bonds.

==Definition==

High-yield bonds are generally defined as bonds [[Bond basics#Credit ratings | rated]] below BBB. Historically, most high-yield bonds were originally [[Corporate bonds | investment-grade bonds]] which were downgraded to junk status. The 1980s saw the widespread use of [[Wikipedia: Mezzanine capital|mezzanine financing]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.bondcapital.ca/media/pdf/Bond_Capital_Mezzanine_Finance.pdf| title=Mezzanine Finance| publisher=Bond Capital Messanine Inc.| date=2012| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200612110441/https://www.bondcapital.ca/wp-content/uploads/pdfs/what-is-mezzanine-finance.pdf| archive-date=June 12, 2020}}]&lt;/ref&gt; in leveraged buy-outs and a dramatic expansion of the size of the junk market from $2.6B in 1977 to $227.8B in 1989 (Handbook of Fixed Income Securities, 1991).

==Risks==

High yield bonds exhibit risks applicable to bonds, some of which are pronounced in high yield bonds.

* Credit risk. Because high yield bonds are issued by companies with low credit ratings, there is a much greater risk that the issuers will default.
*Call risk. Issuers typically call their bonds when the interest rate goes down. High yield bonds come with additional call risk. If the issuers' [[Bond basics#Credit ratings | credit ratings]] improve, they can call the existing bonds and borrow money at a lower interest rate. This type of call risk is not applicable to bonds with high ratings. 

==Role in a portfolio==

Investors should almost always purchase high-yield bonds as part of a low cost fund. The high default risk makes diversification essential, and high trading costs make individual bond purchases unwise.

Due to the high risk of this asset class, investors could very easily choose not to include it at all in their portfolios. Certain commentators even argue that the risks are unlikely to be rewarded in the future, and that past success was more due to statutory changes limiting the market for junk bonds or due to different kinds of bonds ("fallen angels") that no longer dominate the market (since the rise of bonds used for mezzanine financing) than due to inherent long-term superiority of the asset class. The same commentators generally argue that risk should be taken in equity rather than in fixed income, since the former offers unlimited potential gains, whereas the latter only offers a limited upside due to the coupon being fixed and call options.

Should investors choose to include junk bonds for their diversification and potential high returns? Rick Ferri's ''[[Special:BookSources/978-0-07-170078-8|All About Asset Allocation]]'' suggests 20% of fixed income or 10% of the overall portfolio for early-accumulators, midlife-accumulators, and pre- and active retirees. John Bogle comments that a modest "seasoning" of higher-yielding bonds may be appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.morningstar.com/cover/videoCenter.aspx?id=599816&amp;SR=EVZ128| title=Bogle: Yield Seekers Shouldn't Go Out on a Limb| publisher=Morningstar| date=June 13, 2013}}{{dead link}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When considering the stock/bond breakdown for rules-of-thumb such as "your age in bonds," caution would recommend considering the high-yield portion as part of the former, risky, category rather than as part of the latter, safe, one.

===Are junk bonds equity or fixed-income?===

While high-yield bonds are a distinct asset class, with their own risk and reward characteristics, they have a higher correlation with equities than do investment-grade bonds. For an investment-grade bond, the growth prospects and future profitability of a company are somewhat irrelevant as long as they are judged to be sufficient to meet future bond obligations. For a high-yield bond (or for a stock), the value of the security is intimately linked to the exact state of future profitability. Therefore, junk bonds are much more sensitive to the particulars of the market's valuation of future financial prospects.

"The high-return characteristics and generally junior position in the capital structure makes this security class much closer to equity than traditional fixed income securities," according to Robert Long in the ''Handbook of Fixed Income Securities'', 1991. He continues, "Financing techniques of recent years have developed a variety of instruments including bonds with equity interests, variable payments depending on operating results or commodity indexes, extendable maturities, resettable coupons, automatic conversion to equity, and other esoteric features that further blur the traditional distinction between bonds and stocks."

At the same time, high yield bonds have as a category had returns which cannot be replicated by simply averaging corporate bonds and equity results, and therefore cannot merely be a hybrid of the two categories. Rick Ferri points out the 1st Quarter 2009 Vanguard Results:
+4.6% = High Yield bonds (VWEHX),
+0.1% = Intermediate-Treasury (VFITX),
-10.7% = US Total Stock Market (VTSMX),
-18.1% = US Small Value (VISVX).

In ''[[Special:BookSources/978-0-07-170078-8|All About Asset Allocation]]'', Ferri states:
{{blockquote|Statistically, only about 25 percent of the default risk in high-yield corporate bonds can be attributed to the same factors affecting equity returns; however the results are not statistically significant. If you allocate 10 percent of your total portfolio to one of the B-BB rated bond funds listed at the end of the chapter, at most perhaps 2 percent of that could be considered equity related. ... That being said, very-low-quality bond funds (those with an average credit quality of CCC or less) do have a higher correlation with equity returns.}}

==Corporate high yield bond indexes== 
Bloomberg provides three U.S. corporate high yield bond indexes. 
*'''Bloomberg U.S. Corporate High-Yield Index''' is the most comprehensive index.
*'''Bloomberg U.S. Corporate High-Yield 2% Issuer Capped Index''' limits the exposure of each issuer to 2% of the total market value and redistributes any excess market value index-wide on a pro-rata basis.
* '''Bloomberg U.S. High-Yield Very Liquid Index (VLI)''', is a more liquid version of the U.S. Corporate High-Yield Index.

The Bloomberg 2% capped and VLI indexes are investable. Other U.S. high yield bond indexes include the CSFB High Yield II Index (CSHY), Citigroup US High-Yield Market Index, the Merrill Lynch High Yield Master II (HOAO), and the iBoxx $ Liquid High Yield Index.

      <text bytes="14150" sha1="f6nwviz9sxqavu6tplwpp33zy8d7x39" xml:space="preserve">An '''{{PAGENAME}} (IPS)''' is a statement that defines your general investment goals and objectives. It describes the strategies that you will use to meet these objectives, and contains specific information on subjects such as [[asset allocation]], [[risk]] tolerance, and liquidity requirements.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;For an interactive course on creating an investment policy statement, see: {{cite web| url=https://classroom.morningstar.com/classroom/investing/collection/portfolios/level/100/course/MORN-C870425758?page=1| title=Creating Your Investment Policy Statement| publisher=Morningstar's Investing Classroom| accessdate=June 5, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, you could consider using a simpler ''investing plan'' (see [[#Investing plan |below]]):
*If you find creating a full Investment Policy Statement too complex
*If your investment objectives do not justify the effort needed to create an Investment Policy Statement

== Benefits of using an IPS ==
Every investor could potentially benefit from having an investment policy statement. It provides the foundation for all your future investment decisions. It serves as a guidepost, identifies goals and creates a systematic review process. The IPS aims to keep you focused on your objectives during short-term swings in the market, and gives you a baseline from which to monitor investment performance of your overall portfolio, as well as the performance of individual fund managers.

If you are using some sort of financial advisor, an IPS outlines the ground rules of the relationship between you and that advisor. And you can use the IPS as a reference to see whether or not your portfolio is achieving your stated goals and objectives. You can also use your IPS to evaluate and review any proposed changes to your investments against your overall objectives.

A properly constructed Investment Policy Statement supports following a well-conceived, long-term investment discipline, rather than one that is based on false overconfidence or panic in reaction to short-term market fluctuations.

== Drawbacks of not using an IPS ==
Someone without a written policy often bases decisions on day-to-day events, which regularly leads to chasing short-term performance that may hinder them in reaching long-term goals. Having a policy encourages you to maintain focus on the long-term nature of investing, especially during turbulent or exuberant times.

== Basic sections of an IPS ==
=== Financial account information ===
This area includes:
* Where are your financial assets located?
* How much is in tax-advantaged accounts ([[IRA]], [[Roth IRA]], [[401(k)]], etc) versus taxable accounts?
* How much will you be contributing to these accounts?

=== Investment objectives, time horizon, and risk tolerance ===
Here you list the following:
* Your short-term financial goals and liquidity needs
* Your long-term financial goals and retirement
** Your time-frame for funding these goals
** The length of time for which you will need these assets
** Amount of assets required

=== Asset classes to use and those to avoid ===
For example:
* [[Asset class]]es you decide that you must include in your overall investment portfolio
** U.S. Stocks
** International Stocks
** U.S. Bonds
* Asset classes you would rather avoid due to excessive risk, high expenses, or large tax liabilities, and so on. For example:
** Hedge funds
** Actively-managed funds with high taxable turnover or distributions
** Consider under-weighting tech sector due to my employment there

=== Asset allocation targets and rebalancing ranges ===
This area lists the following:
* Your target allocation between [[stock]]s and [[bond]]s
* Your target allocation for international investments
* Any time-frame for altering these allocations
* The minimum and maximum deviations from these targets that will trigger portfolio [[rebalancing]]

=== Monitoring and control procedures ===
Here you list:
* Your frequency of monitoring
* Your benchmark for comparison of portfolio returns
* The acceptable deviation from benchmark (amount and time)
* Any concrete procedures for future changes to IPS, for example:
** Financial reasons for changing IPS
** Lifestyle reasons for changing IPS
** Any reasons ''not'' to change IPS (for example, short-term market performance)

! style="text-align:left;" | Investment objectives:
|These are my main objectives for my investment program. I have developed them after a review of my financial resources, financial goals, asset allocation, risk tolerance and time horizon.
* Objective 1: To retire at the age of 57
* Objective 2: To have an annual income from my investments of at least $45,000 after taxes and in today’s dollars (inflation assumed to be 3.0 percent yearly)
* Objective 3: To leave a meaningful inheritance for my children
* Objective 4: To minimize potential tax liabilities
* Objective 5: To monitor portfolio allocation against holding limits, to benchmark returns against expectations, and to consider revisions to portfolio as personal situation may dictate
|-
! style="text-align:left;" | Risk tolerance:
|My ability to tolerate the uncertainties, complexities and volatility inherent in the investment markets has been considered in the development of this investment program. The main factors that have influenced my risk tolerance and asset allocation are: age, present financial condition, specific financial goals, discretionary income and its variability, past investment experience.
|-
! style="text-align:left;" | Holding limits:
|My portfolio was developed subject to certain holding limitations. These are limitations on the minimum and maximum percentage investment in each asset class:
* Large Cap U.S. Equities (15-30 percent)
* Mid Cap U.S. Equities (10-25 percent) 
* Small Cap U.S. Equities (5-15 percent)
* Foreign Equities (5-15 percent)
* REITs (0-15 percent)
* Inter-Term Govt Bonds (10-25 percent)
* Corporate Bonds (0-10 percent)
* Cash and Cash Equivalents (5-20 percent)
|-
! style="text-align:left;" | Target allocation:
|Based on my financial resources, financial goals, time horizon, tax status, holding limitations, risk tolerance and [[Historical and Expected Returns| expected investment performance]] a recommended portfolio was determined. The portfolio balances risk and reward and attempts to achieve the stated objectives of the investment program. The initial asset allocation is:
* Large Cap U.S. Equities (25 percent)
* Mid Cap U.S. Equities (10 percent)
* Small Cap U.S. Equities (5 percent)
* Foreign Equities (15 percent)
* REITs (10 percent)
* Inter-Term Govt Bonds (25 percent)
* Corporate Bonds (5 percent)
* Cash Equivalents (5 percent)
|-
! style="text-align:left;" | Selection criteria:
|Investment portfolios used to implement the investment program shall be subject to specified selection criteria and shall be monitored for adherence to my investment policy guidelines, major changes in the portfolios and comparative performance with similar investments. The [[Expense ratios |expense ratio]] and overall cost of funds shall be a major point in the selection criteria. To minimize style drift, index funds are preferred, if available, for all asset class.
|-
! style="text-align:left;" | Review process:
|My investment performance will be monitored and reported on a quarterly basis and will be compared against the appropriate benchmarks. The investment program will be reviewed at least annually to make sure that it continues to achieve his stated objectives. Since this investment program is long-term in nature, the periodic adjustments made to his investment program should be small.
|-
! style="text-align:left;" | Rebalancing:
|The percentage weighting to each asset class within the investment portfolio will vary. The percentage weighting within each asset class will be allowed to vary within a reasonable range of plus or minus an absolute 5 percent or 25 percent of the original allocation amount; whichever is triggered first. To minimize taxable events when rebalancing is required, dividends and net cash inflows will be used to meet the strategic asset allocation targets. If cash flow is not sufficient to meet the target allocation for an asset class, I will decide whether to effect transactions in order to rebalance the asset allocation.

Fellow Boglehead [https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=681 Sunny] was one of the first to post a popular IPS. It may not cover all of the topics necessary for someone with a complicated financial situation, but his IPS is brilliant in its elegance and compactness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://socialize.morningstar.com/NewSocialize/asp/FullConv.asp?forumId=F100000015&amp;convId=183427| title=Diehard Sunny Sarkar's beautiful IPS| author=Taylor Larimore| author-link=Taylor Larimore| date=September 18, 2006| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220621234414/https://socialize.morningstar.com/NewSocialize/asp/FullConv.asp?forumId=F100000015&amp;convId=183427| archive-date=June 21, 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|-
! style="text-align:left;" | Asset allocation:
|Maintain overall 60% stock + 40% fixed-income allocation until home purchase to accommodate both short-term and long-term requirements.

|-
! style="text-align:left;" | Funds and accounts:
|Use low cost mutual funds - index funds preferably - which do not overlap and provide maximum diversification across asset classes. Try to assume only market risk as far as possible. Try to shelter tax-inefficient funds in tax-advantaged accounts to reduce tax drag.
|-
! style="text-align:left;" | Target allocation:
|
* VTSMX - Total Stock Market Fund 45% - Taxable account
* VGTSX - Total Int'l Market Fund 15% - Roth IRA
* VIPSX - TIPS Fund 20% - Traditional IRA
* IIBAX - Intermediate Bond Fund 20% - 401k
* VMMXX - Money Market fund (6 months' expenses) - Taxable account 
|-
! style="text-align:left;" | Other considerations:
|Automate future contributions wherever possible. Rebalance yearly. No market timing. Exact sub-allocations are not as important as maintaining the overall 60/40 stock/fixed allocation - no need to make things complex in order to meet sub-allocation targets.

==Investing plan==
In some cases, a ''formal'' investing policy statement may seem too complicated or inconvenient. In that case, you could develop an informal ''investing plan'' (also referred to as an ''investment plan'') instead. Whether it is called a policy or a plan, the idea is that you have a clear understanding of managing your investment goals and objectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Forum link| t=69802| title=EmergDoc's Investing Plan Thread}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bogleheads forum often gets questions such as "I have $50K saved up and I need to know which funds to put it in!". Setting up an investing plan will help answer these questions.

An investing plan can be as easy as following these simple steps:
*''Step 1'' - Formulate your goals. Be as specific as possible, realizing that you will make changes as the years go by.
*''Step 2'' - Set up a plan for each goal. The plan consists of identifying what type of account you will use to save the money, choosing the amount you will put toward the goal each year, working out an asset allocation likely to reach the goal with the minimum risk necessary, and identifying a plan B for the goal in case the returns you are planning on do not materialize.
*''Step 3'' - Select the best (usually lowest cost) investments to fulfill your desired asset allocation. Using all or mostly index funds further simplifies the process.

Some typical goals that can benefit from an investing plan:
*I want $40,000 for home downpayment by June 30, 2030
*I want to have enough money to pay the tuition at my alma mater in 13 years when my 5 year old turns 18
*I want to have $2&amp;nbsp;million saved for retirement by Jan 1 2050

For a detailed discussion on how to achieve those goals, see {{Forum link| t=69802| title=EmergDoc's Investing Plan Thread}}.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' are marketable items produced to satisfy wants or needs. Economic commodities comprise goods and services.&lt;ref&gt;[[wikipedia:Commodity|Commodity]], on Wikipedia.&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of financial markets, commodities are raw materials that are traded on futures trading markets.  Examples include oil, crops and precious metals.

The primary purposes of commodities futures trading are:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commodityfuturescontract.asp. Commodities Futures Contract], Adam Hayes, Investopedia, {{date|3/28/2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Hedging -  locking in future commodity prices by farmers, industry and other parties. 
#Speculation - attempting to profit on commodity price movement by speculators. 

In terms of individual portfolio management, there are also [[mutual fund]]s and [[exchange-traded fund]]s (ETFs) that attempt to track and capture future price appreciation of commodities.

==Regulatory==
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is the federal government agency that regulates the commodity futures, commodity options, and swaps trading markets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cftc.gov/ConsumerProtection/Resources/index.htm Learning Resources - CFTC]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;A commodity is defined as:{{quotation|(1) A commodity, as defined in the Commodity Exchange Act, includes the agricultural commodities enumerated in Section 1a(9) of the Commodity Exchange Act, 7 USC 1a(9), and all other goods and articles, except onions as provided in Public Law 85-839 (7 USC 13-1), a 1958 law that banned futures trading in onions, and all services, rights, and interests in which contracts for future delivery are presently or in the future dealt in; (2) A physical commodity such as an agricultural product or a natural resource as opposed to a financial instrument such as a currency or interest rate.|[http://www.cftc.gov/ConsumerProtection/EducationCenter/CFTCGlossary/index.htm#C CFTC Glossary]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Commission was established as an independent agency in 1974, assuming responsibilities that had previously belonged to the Department of Agriculture since the 1920s. The Commission historically has been charged by the CEA with regulatory authority over the commodity futures markets. These markets have existed since the 1860s, beginning with agricultural commodities such as wheat, corn, and cotton.
 
Over time, these commodity futures markets, known as designated contract markets (DCMs) regulated by the Commission, have grown to include those for energy and metals commodities such as crude oil, heating oil, gasoline, copper, gold, and silver. The agency now also oversees DCMs for financial products such as interest rates, stock indexes, and foreign currency.

==Risks==

Direct trading of commodities via the futures markets tends to be very risky because commodity prices can be volatile. In addition leverage is typically used when speculating with financial futures.  Direct trading in commodity futures is not ordinarily a part of an individual investor's portfolio. 

Commodities investments via mutual funds and ETFs are comparatively safer and more appropriate for individual investors, but still come with material risks:
* Commodities have significant price volatility and can have positive or negative multi-year periods of return,&lt;ref&gt;[https://faculty.fuqua.duke.edu/~charvey/Research/Published_Papers/P124_Conquering_misperceptions_about.pdf Conquering Misconceptions about Commodity Futures Investing],Claude Erb and Campbell Harvey, Financial Analysts Journal, July/August  2016&lt;/ref&gt; but over the very long term tend to have low or no real inflation adjusted return.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2020/04/27/oil-and-commodity-prices-are-where-they-were-160-years-ago Commodity prices are where they are 160 years ago],The Economist, {{date|4/27/2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; By themselves their risk return relationship is not particularly attractive. 
* Commodity prices are often sensitive to economic cycles, and may experience price declines at the same time as stock/equity investments. 
* Commodities are traded via futures and do not exactly equal the current "spot" prices.  Thus returns on commodity based funds may have material variances in returns vs. popular commodity price indices. The causes of this are "contango" and "backwardation".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/documents/research/research-rethinking-commodities.pdf Rethinking Commodities ], by Fiona Boal and Jim Wiederhold, S&amp;P Dow Jones, January 2020 &lt;/ref&gt; These result due to rollover of futures contracts because individual investors do not want to take delivery of the actual commodities. 
* Commodity funds tend to have higher expense ratios than comparable stock and bond funds.
* Some commodity ETFs issue K-1 tax forms which can complicate and delay individuals annual tax return filings.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.etf.com/sections/features-and-news/k-1-taxes-hurdle-commodity-etfs K-1 Taxes Hurdle For Commodity ETFs ], by Lara Crigger, ETF.com, {{date|4/9/2018}} &lt;/ref&gt;

==Role in a portfolio==
Commodity spot prices, as an asset class, over the very long term, have not generated a significant real return. Commodity mutual funds and ETFs invest in futures contracts that derive excess returns over the risk free rate of return from two sources:
#Changes in futures prices
#The roll yield—which can be either positive or negative—that results from replacing an expiring contract with a further out contract in order to avoid physical delivery yet maintain positions in the futures markets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://corporate.morningstar.com/US/documents/Indexes/PuttingMomentumIntoCommodities.pdf Putting Momentum into Commodities], by Paul D. Kaplan, Morningstar, {{date|10/14/2011}} &lt;/ref&gt;

Some individual and institutional investors include commodities as part of their portfolio for purposes of diversification of returns and inflation protection.  Commodities do provide some level of protection against unexpected inflation. Protection against expected protection is more modest.&lt;ref&gt;[https://personal.vanguard.com/pdf/ISGCTIPS.pdf Commodities and short-term TIPS, how each combats unexpected inflation], Paul Bosse, CFA, Vanguard Research, June 2019&lt;/ref&gt;

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a term used to define a company that is involved in the exploration or production of a precious metal. Common precious metals include [[Gold|gold]], silver, platinum, iridium, rhodium, and palladium.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/preciousmetal.asp definiition], investopedia. &lt;/ref&gt; Some investors prefer using gold mining stocks as a substitute for gold bullion in an investment portfolio, and use a [[Mutual fund|mutual fund]] or [[Exchange Traded Funds|exchange traded fund]] that invests in gold mining stocks. The precious metal mining industry is a global industry; so the funds that invest in precious metals equity are [[Global fund|global funds]].

==Risks==
Precious metal mining stocks are subject to a number of risks. These risks include:

* '''Market risk''': Mining stocks are subject to the forces that affect the overall stock market. 
* '''Concentration risk''': Mining stocks are a small subsector of the market, and are affected by the economic and political forces that can affect precious metals and precious metal mining companies.
* '''Currency risk''': For U.S. investors, the returns realized from foreign mining companies are subject to the rise and fall of currency exchange rates.

==Role in a portfolio==
The following arguments support the inclusion of precious metal (gold) mining stocks in an investment portfolio.
* Unlike gold bullion, mining stocks produce economic value by profiting from the extraction and processing of metals. Shareholder's receive this value through the distribution of profits via dividends.
* Precious metal mining stocks have historically realized low correlations to the broad U.S. stock market and the U.S. treasury bond market. In addition, precious metal mining stocks historically have been volatile. While the returns of precious metals equity have been lower than the broad market, the characteristics of low correlation and high volatility are features which provide for positive returns for a rebalanced portfolio. [[William Bernstein]] finds that disciplined rebalancing precious metals equity has historically added a five percent bonus to precious metals equity returns.&lt;ref name="Longest discipline"&gt; [http://www.efficientfrontier.com/ef/adhoc/gold.htm  The Longest Discipline], by William J. Bernstein &lt;/ref&gt;.
* Bernstein also notes that precious metals equity requires a very long investment horizon, as returns of this sector can have very long periods of poor performance.&lt;ref name="Longest discipline"/&gt; 

Investors who include gold bullion in asset class selection usually do not consider precious metals equity as a suitable replacement for bullion in a portfolio. In this view, commodity gold provides an insurance function against disorder in currency, equity, and bond markets that precious metals mining stocks, as stocks, cannot reliably provide.&lt;ref&gt; [[Craig Rowland]] and [[J. M. Lawson]], ''The Permanent Portfolio: Harry Browne's Long-Term Investment Strategy'', John Wiley &amp; Sons (2012) ISBN 978-1118288252 &lt;/ref&gt;

==Precious metals equity and gold stock indexes==

Commonly sited indexes of gold stocks include the NYSE Arca Gold BUGS Index, the Philadelphia Gold and Silver Index, and the NYSE Arca Gold Miners Index.

* '''NYSE Arca Gold BUGS''' (Basket of Unhedged Gold Stocks) Index (HUI) is a modified equal dollar weighted index of companies involved in gold mining. The HUI Index was designed to provide significant exposure to near term movements in gold prices by including companies that do not hedge their gold production beyond 1.5 years. The HUI Index was developed with a base value of 200.00 as of March 15, 1996.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amex.com/othProd/prodInf/OpPiIndMain.jsp?Product_Symbol=HUI HUI], New York Stock Exchange&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Historical data can be found at [[https://www.nyse.com/search?q=hui&amp;site=IntercontinentalExchange%7CNYSE%7Cinstruments%7CtheICE%7CtheICEProductGuide%7CtheICEReports&amp;client=nyse_frontend_html&amp;proxystylesheet=nyse_frontend_html&amp;output=xml_no_dtd&amp;filter=0&amp;getfields=* NYSE Arca Gold BUGS Index (HUI)]. There is also a short index: [https://www.nyse.com/search?q=huish&amp;site=IntercontinentalExchange%7CNYSE%7Cinstruments%7CtheICE%7CtheICEProductGuide%7CtheICEReports&amp;client=nyse_frontend_html&amp;proxystylesheet=nyse_frontend_html&amp;output=xml_no_dtd&amp;filter=0&amp;getfields=* NYSE Arca Gold BUGS Short Index (HUISH)]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Philadelphia Gold and Silver Index''' (XUA) is a capitalization-weighted index composed of 16 companies involved in the gold and silver mining industry. XAU was set to an initial value of 100 in January 1979.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.nasdaqtrader.com/micro.aspx?id=phlxsectorscontractspecs#XAU NASDAQ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.kitco.com/pop_windows/stocks/xau.html Stock prices of indexed companies at kitco.com] &lt;/ref&gt;
* '''NYSE Arca Gold Miners Index''' (GDM) is a modified market capitalization weighted index comprised of publicly traded companies involved primarily in the mining for gold and silver. The Index divisor was initially determined to yield a benchmark value of 500.00 at the close of trading on December 20, 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amex.com/othProd/prodInf/OpPiIndMain.jsp?Product_Symbol=GDM GDM], New York Stock Exchange&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Historical data can be found at [https://www.nyse.com/search?q=gdm&amp;site=IntercontinentalExchange%7CNYSE%7Cinstruments%7CtheICE%7CtheICEProductGuide%7CtheICEReports&amp;client=nyse_frontend_html&amp;proxystylesheet=nyse_frontend_html&amp;output=xml_no_dtd&amp;filter=0&amp;getfields=* NYSE Arca Gold Miners Index (GDM)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, S&amp;P&lt;ref&gt;[http://us.spindices.com/indices/equity/sp-global-bmi-gold-us-dollar The S&amp;P Global BMI Gold Index] &lt;/ref&gt; and MSCI&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.msci.com/resources/factsheets/index_fact_sheet/msci-acwi-select-gold-miners-imi-net.pdf MSCI ACWI Select Gold Miners IMI factsheet]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.msci.com/resources/factsheets/index_fact_sheet/msci-acwi-select-silver-miners-imi-net.pdf MSCI ACWI Select Silver Miners IMI factsheet] &lt;/ref&gt; provide indexes of gold and silver mining stocks. Dow Jones provides  a Precious Metals Index&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.djindexes.com/mdsidx/downloads/fact_info/Dow_Jones_Precious_Metals_Index_Fact_Sheet.pdf Dow Jones Precious Metals Fact Sheet] &lt;/ref&gt;

==Mutual funds==
The U.S. mutual fund universe contains a sizable number of gold and precious metals funds, all of which are actively managed funds, and many which are broker-distributed load funds. Morningstar tracks performance of these funds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.morningstar.com/fund-category-returns/equity-precious-metals/$FOCA$SP.aspx Equity Precious Metals: Total Returns], Morningstar &lt;/ref&gt; Active funds add to the risks inherent in investing in precious metals funds by introducing '''manager risk''', the chance that poor security selection  will cause the fund to underperform relevant benchmarks or other funds with a similar investment objective.&lt;ref group="note"&gt; The Vanguard Precious Metals &amp; Mining fund is not a suitable option for investing in precious metals equity. In 2004 Vanguard broadened the mandate of the Vanguard Precious Metals fund to include base metal and other materials mining stocks. (See [http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/734383/000093247104000488/specializedfundsfinal.txt 2004 Annual Report]). The move essentially ended the fund's applicability as an allocation in gold equity. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Exchange traded funds==
In the U.S. indexed portfolios containing gold and silver mining companies are offered by Van Eck Global (fund inception 05/16/06), Powershares (fund inception 09/18/2008), Global X (fund inception 11/03/2010) and [[Blackrock iShares]] (fund inception 01/31/2012).

Note that the  Global X Gold Explorers ETF and the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF track "junior" gold mining stock indexes. Junior gold mining stocks are small speculative companies that are engaged in finding gold deposits. If exploitable deposits are found, these deposits, or the company itself, is usually sold to an established "major" gold mining company.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.investopedia.com/articles/basics/12/beginners-guide-mining-stocks.asp A Beginner's Guide To Mining Stocks], investopedia, October 11 2012 &lt;/ref&gt;

{{for|additional information|wikipedia:United States Treasury security}}

'''Series I Savings Bonds''' (often called '''I Bonds''') are government savings bonds issued by the U.S. Treasury that offer inflation protection. I Bonds offer tax-deferral for up to 30 years and are free from state and local taxation. I Bonds are not marketable securities and cannot be traded in the secondary market.

Note: [[Treasury Inflation Protected Securities]] (TIPS) also provide inflation protection. TIPS are considered alternatives to I Bonds. See [[I Bonds vs TIPS]] for similarities and differences between the two instruments.

==History==

I bonds were first issued in September, 1998. Historical interest rates, along with computation metrics, for I bond issues can be found at [http://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/research/indepth/ibonds/res_ibonds_iratesandterms.htm TreasuryDirect].

==Rates and terms==
===Composite rate===
I Bonds have two components that make up their composite rate (total yield): a fixed rate and an inflation rate.
* The '''fixed rate''' is fixed for the entire life of any given I Bond. The fixed rate for newly-issued I Bonds is announced on May 1 and November 1 of each year, and applies to all I Bonds issued during that six month period.
* The '''inflation rate''' is based on the Consumer Price Index and is also announced every six months, on May 1 and November 1. The May rate is based on the change in the CPI-U from the previous September to March and the November rate on the change from March to September. This inflation adjustment applies to both existing I Bonds and newly-issued ones, but the timing of that adjustment is dependent on the original issue date of any particular I Bond.

The composite rate can never go below zero, which protects investors in times of deflation.

Interest accrues monthly and compounds semiannually.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treasurydirect.gov/news/pressroom/currenteebondratespr.htm Nov 2009 TreasuryDirect Press Release Announcing the New Rates]&lt;/ref&gt; The accrual date is the first of the month, and the redemption value does not change between accrual dates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/retrieveECFR?gp=1&amp;SID=fb5d179703df8bce0b33b2d270075490&amp;ty=HTML&amp;h=L&amp;n=31y2.1.1.1.55&amp;r=PART#31:2.1.1.1.55.1.17.4 31 CFR 359.3]&lt;/ref&gt; This means that on each 6th month anniversary of the issue date the value of the bond is increased by the interest earned during that 6 month period. However, until the bond is owned for 5 years, the value of the bond is reduced by the latest 3 months worth of interest which is a penalty for selling early. After 5 years of ownership there is no penalty and the full value of interest earned is included in the bond value shown on the Treasury Direct site. An additional restriction is that the bond may not be redeemed until it has been held for 12 months.

===Six-month cycle of composite earnings rates===
I Bond interest is calculated in six month cycles, based on the original date of issue. Each I Bond's composite rate (fixed and inflation) remains in effect for a total of six months, and then changes to a combination of that I Bond's fixed rate plus the most recently announced inflation adjustment for the next six months. That cycle continues for the life of an I Bond:

An example of the composite rate calculation using I bonds issued May 2009 - Oct. 2009:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.savingsbonds.gov/indiv/research/indepth/ibonds/res_ibonds_iratesandterms.htm I Savings Bonds Rates &amp; Terms]&lt;/ref&gt;

:Given a Fixed rate = 0.10% and a Semiannual inflation rate = -2.78%

:Composite rate = [Fixed rate + (2 x Semiannual inflation rate) + (Fixed rate x Semiannual inflation rate)]
:Composite rate = [0.0010 + (2 &amp;times; -0.0278) + (0.0010 &amp;times; -0.0278)]
:Composite rate = [0.0010 + (-0.0556) + (-0.0000278)]
:Composite rate = [-0.0546278]
:Composite rate = -0.0546
:Composite rate = -5.46%
:Composite rate = 0.00% (Composite rates are never less than zero)

===How the formula works===

If the inflation rate during the six months the composite rate applies is the same as the inflation rate from the previous period used in the computation of the composite rate, the pre-tax real return is the fixed rate. Example: assume a fixed rate of 1% and a semi-annual inflation rate of 1.5%. The [[#Composite rate | composite rate]] = [.01 + (2 &amp;times; .015) + (.01 &amp;times; .015)] = .04015. After six months, $1 invested in the I bond is worth 

:(1 + .04015/2) = 1.020075, and what used to cost $1 now costs 1.015 after inflation.

Before, $1 would buy 1.0 item that cost $1. Now you have $1.020075, but the item now costs $1.015. You can now buy

:1.020075/1.015 = 1.005 items, 0.5% more than before.

Your real return for the six months is 0.5%. This produces an annual real return of 1.0% (the fixed rate), compounded every six months (the actual real return after one year is greater than 1.0% because of the compounding).

===How interest is calculated===
All bond values are based on the $25 bond. A $5000 bond is worth 200 times what a $25 bond is worth; a $100 bond is worth 4 times what a $25 bond is worth. If you have a $80 electronic bond at TreasuryDirect, it is worth 3.2 $25 bonds. The $25 bond value is always rounded to the nearest penny. Thus, a $5000 bond must always have a value that is a multiple of $2.00.

Interest is computed on a $25 bond using the composite rate divided by 2 for the given six month period. For individual months within the six month period, interest is computed using pseudo-monthly compounding to produce the same result after six months. For example, if the composite rate is 2.57%, the bond value after

:1 month&amp;nbsp; is $25 &amp;times; (1 + 0.0257/2)^(1/6) = $25.05, and after
:4 months is $25 &amp;times; (1 + 0.0257/2)^(4/6) = $25.21, and after
:6 months is $25 &amp;times; (1 + 0.0257/2)^(6/6) = $25.32.

The values of a $100 bond would be $100.20, $100.84, and $101.28 after those same time periods. Note that this ignores the 3 month penalty for redemption within the first 5 years and the restriction on redemption within the first year.

===Current interest rates and I Bond value===
To find out the current interest rate of I Bonds and the worth of your bonds, the following resources of [http://www.savingsbonds.gov/tdhome.htm TreasuryDirect] may be used:
* [http://www.savingsbonds.gov/indiv/research/indepth/ibonds/res_ibonds_iratesandterms.htm I Savings Bonds Rates and Terms]
* [http://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/tools/tools_savingsbondcalc.htm Savings Bond Calculator]
* [http://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/tools/tools_savingsbondwizard.htm Savings Bond Wizard]

The website [https://www.eyebonds.info/ibonds/home10000.html eyebonds.info] can also be useful to determine the interest rate and worth of your bonds based on when they are purchased.

==Purchase and redemption==
===Who can own I Bonds===
Savings bonds may be owned not only by individuals, but by ''entities'', such as trusts, estates of deceased persons, living estates [where a court has appointed a guardian for a person, such as one who is incompetent], corporations, and partnerships.&lt;ref name="register"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/research/indepth/ibonds/registeringibonds.htm| title=Registering a Savings Bond: Series I | publisher=TreasuryDirect| accessdate=July 19, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individual adults can buy savings bonds for children under the age of 18 and register the bonds in the name of a child or children.&lt;ref name="register" /&gt;

Entities are permitted to open accounts in TreasuryDirect. An entity account must be opened by an individual (known as the entity account manager) who can legally act alone when managing the account on behalf of the entity or organization.&lt;ref name="entity"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/help/TDHelp/help_ug_292-EntityAccountsLearnMore.htm| title=Learn More About Entity Accounts | publisher=TreasuryDirect| accessdate=July 19, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The references to "you" and "your" in this article refer to the primary account holder, which can be an individual or an entity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?cb&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se31.2.363_16&amp;rgn=div8| title=§363.6 What special terms do I need to know to understand this part? | publisher= Electronic Code of Federal Regulations (e-CFR) |series= 31 CFR §363.6 |quote= ''You or your'' refers to a TreasuryDirect primary account holder. | accessdate=July 19, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Direct purchase===
I Bonds are sold at face value; for example, you would pay $100 for a $100 I Bond. I Bonds are not marketable securities, meaning that, unlike other bonds and stocks, you cannot trade I Bonds in the secondary market.
* '''Electronic I Bonds''' - You can buy electronic I Bonds at [http://www.savingsbonds.gov/indiv/indiv.htm TreasuryDirect]. Purchases may be made in amounts of $25 or more, to the penny.
* '''Purchase limits''' - $10,000 maximum purchase in one calendar year, with an additional $5,000 in paper I Bonds per Social Security number using your IRS tax refund.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/research/indepth/ebonds/res_e_bonds_eecomparison.htm I and EE Savings Bond Comparison], from TreasuryDirect.gov.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* '''Paper I Bonds''' - Paper I Bonds may be replaced if they were lost, stolen, mutilated, or never received.&lt;ref group="note" name="Replace"&gt;The process for replacing paper I bonds can be found at TreasuryDirect.gov: [https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/research/indepth/ibonds/res_ibonds_ireplace.htm Individual - Replacing or Reissuing a Paper I Bond]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gifts===
Savings bonds purchased as gifts are not included in your annual purchase limit.&lt;ref name="TreasDirect"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/research/articles/res_invest_articles_purchaselimits_0406.htm| title=Purchase Limits | publisher=TreasuryDirect| accessdate=July 19, 2021}} and {{cite web| url=https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?mc=true&amp;node=se31.2.363_152&amp;rgn=div8| title=§363.52 What is the principal amount of book-entry Series EE and Series I savings bonds that I may acquire in one year? | publisher= Electronic Code of Federal Regulations (e-CFR) |series= 31 CFR §363.52 | accessdate=July 19, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Savings bonds received as gifts are applied to the receiver's annual purchase limit in the year the transaction occurs (when they are delivered to the recipient).&lt;ref name="TreasDirect" /&gt;

Savings bonds purchased as gifts begin accruing interest the month they are purchased and will have a maturity date 30 years after the purchase month. 

In order to purchase savings bonds as a gift, you will need to know the recipient’s Social Security Number. This allows you to register the individual and purchase the bonds, placing them into your Gift Box in Treasury Direct. There is a waiting period of 5 business days for the funds to clear. After the funds clear, they may be transferred to the recipient using their Treasury Direct account number.

'''Example 1:''' Your aunt buys $10k of I bonds as a gift for you in December 2020. She delivers the gift to you in January 2021. You have now acquired $10k of I bonds in 2021. You are not allowed to buy even $1 worth of I bonds for yourself, although you could buy $100k worth as gifts for others.

'''Example 2:''' You purchase $10k of I bonds as a gift for your spouse on October 15, 2022. The bond will begin accruing interest in October 2022 but remain in your Gift Box until you manually deliver the bond from your account. The bond will have an Issue Date of 10-01-2022 and Maturity Date of 10-01-2052.

===Conversion===
If you have paper I Bonds, you may convert any or all of these paper bonds to electronic bonds. This conversion does ''not'' apply to your annual purchase limit of $10,000 in electronic I-Bonds (see quote on the side from the IRS website).
{{Quote
|quote = '''Conversion'''
"There is no limit on how many previously-issued paper bonds can be converted to electronic securities in your TreasuryDirect account in a single year."

'''Redeem Bonds'''

"To redeem electronic bonds purchased in ''TreasuryDirect'', log in and follow the on-screen directions. Your checking or savings account will be credited with the redemption amount within one business day of the redemption date.

You can cash your I Bonds at most local financial institutions. Treasury doesn’t maintain a listing of local banks that redeem bonds, so check with the banks in your area. When you present the bonds, you’ll be asked to establish your identity. You can do this by:

* Being a customer with an active account open for at least 6 months at the financial institution that will be paying the bonds, or
* Presenting documentary identification, such as a driver's license.

If you're not listed as the owner or co-owner on the bonds you're redeeming, you'll have to establish that you're entitled to redeem the bonds. It's always a good idea to check with your financial institution before presenting the bonds for payment to find out what identification and other documents you need. "

[http://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/research/indepth/ibonds/res_ibonds_iredeem.htm Treasury Direct:Redeem I Savings Bonds]}}
===Redemption===
I Bonds cannot be redeemed during the first year, and if you redeem them within the first five years after purchase, you lose the most recent three months' interest. When you redeem your I Bonds, you can never get back less than you invested, even if there was a long period of negative inflation (deflation).

==Tax benefits==
===Tax-deferred growth===

Interest from I Bonds accumulates tax-deferred for up to 30 years. (I Bonds do not distribute interest like CDs and other bonds do.) After 30 years, the I Bonds reach final maturity and no longer earn any additional interest. When I Bonds mature or are redeemed, the interest is taxable income for federal income tax purposes, but is free from state and local taxation. However, if the entire proceeds of the I Bond redemption (both principal and interest) are used for qualifying educational expenses, the interest can be tax-free at the federal level (see below). You also have the choice of paying income taxes on the accrued interest each year (which may be advantageous if a bond is titled in a child's name). 

Both "redemption" and "maturity" of savings bonds are taxable events, whichever occurs first is when the bond is taxed.&lt;ref&gt; According to [https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/research/indepth/ibonds/res_ibonds_itaxconsider.htm Series I Savings Bonds Tax Considerations].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tax-free growth for qualified education expenses===

If I Bonds are redeemed for qualifying education expenses, the interest is completely tax free, provided certain conditions are met.

====Conditions====
According to [http://www.irs.gov/publications/p970/ch10.html Publication 970 (2009), Tax Benefits for Education], the tax-free redemption requires the following conditions to be met:

* You pay qualified educational expenses for yourself, your spouse, or a dependent for whom you claim an exemption on your return.
* Your modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) is less than $84,950 for single taxpayers ($134,900 if married filing jointly or qualifying widow(er)). The amount of your interest exclusion is gradually reduced (phased out) if your modified adjusted gross income is between $69,950 and $84,950 (between $104,900 and $134,900 if your filing status is married filing jointly or qualifying widow(er)). You cannot exclude any of the interest if your modified adjusted gross income is equal to or more than the upper limit.The phaseout, if any, is figured for you when you fill out [http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f8815.pdf Form 8815]. The MAGI numbers are adjusted annually.
* Your filing status is not married filing separately.
* The owner of the Savings Bonds must be at least 24 years old before the bond's issue date. (The issue date is printed on the front of the Savings Bond.)
* The full proceeds of the savings bond redemption (both interest and principal) must be used for qualifying educational expenses.

====529 plans====
Note that redeeming I Bonds to contribute to a [[529 plan]] or a [[Coverdell Education Savings Accounts (ESAs)|Coverdell education savings account]] is also considered a qualified educational expense. To take advantage of this, file IRS [http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f8815.pdf Form 8815] to claim an exclusion for the interest after rolling the proceeds of these US Savings Bonds into a section 529 college savings plan or Coverdell Education Savings account. Write "529 College Savings Plan" or "Coverdell Education Savings Account" in the answer to 1(b), where it asks for the name of the educational institution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finaid.org/savings/529plans.phtml#Contributions FinAid Section 529 Plans]&lt;/ref&gt;. Note that there are certain restrictions, such as the fact that the child beneficiary cannot be listed as a co-owner on the bonds. See [http://www.irs.gov/publications/p970/ch10.html Publication 970 (2009), Tax Benefits for Education] for more details.

====Modified AGI limits====
As of 2013, for all other filing statuses, your interest exclusion is phased out if your modified AGI is between $72,850 and $87,850 (filing single) or between $109,250 and $139,250 (married filing jointly)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/planning/plan_education.htm Education Planning], from TreasuryDirect.&lt;/ref&gt;. You cannot take the exclusion if your modified AGI is above those limits. You are disqualified from the interest exclusion if you are married filing separately. For more information, see chapter 11 in Publication 970, Tax Benefits for Education.

If you expect to be above the MAGI levels the following year, it may be prudent to use I-Bonds for qualified educational expenses (such as using them to fund a 529 plan) in the current year, to avoid paying taxes on the interest.

==Role in a portfolio==

* If your tax-advantaged accounts are filled up with bond funds, you can "extend" your tax-advantaged accounts by purchasing I Bonds in your taxable account. This process is somewhat similar, but not identical, to placing Treasury Inflation Protected Securities in your [[Non-deductible Traditional IRA]]. Buying I Bonds in your taxable account is particularly useful if your tax bracket is too low to justify owning tax-exempt bonds in your taxable account.
* If you are desperately looking for tax-advantaged space to hold tax-inefficient assets like REITs, you can free up some of your tax-advantaged space by purchasing I Bonds in your taxable account and then exchanging a part of the bond allocation in your tax-advantaged account to a REIT fund.
* If you have a tax-free growth account like a Roth IRA, but no tax-deferred account like a Traditional IRA, you may want to place stocks in the Roth IRA while buying I Bonds in your taxable account to make the maximum use of the tax-free growth in the Roth IRA.
* I-bonds older than 1 year can serve as an emergency fund if you can absorb the 3-month interest penalty; otherwise I-bonds at least 5 years old serve as an emergency fund just fine. The yield can at times be higher than money market funds or bank savings accounts.

==Caveats==
===Redemption while in a high tax bracket===

I Bonds redeemed when the investor is in a high tax bracket may provide little or no positive after-tax, after-inflation return, especially if they are held for shorter periods of time. For this reason, if you expect to be in a high tax bracket when you redeem your I Bonds, they may not be a suitable investment for you. Specifically, if you are in your 20s, in 30 years you may well be in your peak earning years, which means you would probably be in a high tax bracket when the bonds mature.

To illustrate the point, here is the after-tax, after-inflation value of $1 invested in I bonds compounded for 30 years (60 semi-annual periods) with 3% inflation and a 1% fixed rate and then redeemed in the 35% federal income tax bracket:

:(1 + ((1 + 0.04015/2)^60 - 1) &amp;times; (1 - 0.35)) / (1.03^30) = $1.02671191
:where 0.04015 is the [[#Composite rate | composite rate]] (.01 + (2 &amp;times; .015) + (.01 &amp;times; .015) = .04015) and 0.0415/2 is the rate that is compounded every 6 months (60 times in 30 years)

This is equivalent to a real after-tax return of 0.088%/year.

==Tips for buying I Bonds==
Since I Bonds earn the full month's interest if you own them on the last day of that month, it is generally a good idea to buy I Bonds at the end of a month after also earning interest on that same money in a bank account during most of that same month. Conversely, you would want to redeem your I Bonds at the beginning of any month, since holding them until later in the month will not earn any additional interest, unless you own them on the last day of the month.

Because US large-cap stocks and international large-cap stocks have high correlation, some investors look for '''international small cap''' [[Mutual fund|mutual funds]] and [[Exchange-traded funds|ETFs]] to further diversify their portfolios. This page is intended to present a summary of international small cap mutual funds and ETFs. 

==Selection==
New ETFs open regularly, so this list is not complete. It includes the major ETFs and mutual funds, but excludes those which are unlikely to be of interest to most investors because they are only available through advisors, very expensive, or very small and so expensive to trade.

==Caution==

===Tracking error===

Because these ETFs trade in illiquid stocks, many of them only sample the indexes they track, and they incur transaction costs when the indexes change. Therefore, the ETFs do not necessarily track the index well; deviations of 1% annually are common. EWX underperformed its index by about 3% annually through 2012, was close in 2013-2015, outperformed the index in 2016-2018, and underperformed again in 2020 and 2023-2024. (This tracking error is based on the [[Net asset value|net asset value]]; when you buy or sell an ETF, this may add to the tracking error because these ETFs frequently trade at a premium or discount to net asset value.)

===Tax efficiency===

Vanguard International Explorer Fund has been very tax inefficient, and since it is actively managed and is not an ETF, it is likely to remain tax-inefficient, You should strongly consider holding it in a tax-advantaged account. Similarly, Schwab Fundamental Small Company Index Fund and Avantis International Small Cap-Value Fund have distributed some capital gains, and are likely to distribute more because of fund turnover; in a taxable account, use the analogous ETFs FNDC and AVDV instead. (Even though AVDV is an actively managed ETF, the ETF structure makes it less likely to distribute capital gains, and it has never distributed any.)

Small-cap international ETFs tend to distribute more capital gains than other ETFs, possibly because there is less creation/redemption activity. Some foreign countries, particularly emerging markets, do not allow in-kind redemptions, eliminating the tax benefit from the redemption process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/investment-products/etf/etfs-tax-efficiency| title=ETFs versus Mutual Funds, Tax Efficiency| publisher=Fidelity| accessdate=May 26, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt; Small-cap ETFs should be less likely to distribute gains after several years of operation, because the redemption process is more effective at reducing gains when shares have been purchased at a wide range of prices. As of 2024, only the SPDR ETFs GWX and EWX have distributed gains after the second year, and none have distributed a gain since 2015.

GWX has has the largest distributions; it distributed a 1.5% short-term gain in its first year (2007), an 0.8% long-term gain in 2011, a 2.7% short-term and 7.5% long-term gain in 2014, an 0.5% short-term and trivial long-term gain in 2015, an 0.8% short-term and 0.5% long-term gain in 2016, and a 2.0% short-term and 0.9% long-term gain in 2019. EWX distributed a 1.5% short-term gain in its second year (2009), a 2.1% short-term and 0.5% long-term gain in 2010, and a 1.3% short-term and 2.2% long-term gain in 2011. VSS distributed a 0.7% short-term gain in its first year (2009) and 0.4% short-term and 0.4% long-term in its second year (2010). DLS distributed an 0.8% short-term gain in its second year (2007). 

Independent of capital gains, DLS and DGS are likely to have higher tax costs than the other ETFs, because their indexes overweight stocks with a higher dividend yield.  The other value ETFs are factor-based, not dividend-based, and tend not to have a higher dividend yield than blend ETFs.

===Trading costs===

Many of the ETFs above are thinly traded, and even those which have fairly high volume have larger-than-average [[bid/ask spread]] because the value of the underlying stocks is more difficult to estimate.

===Underlying securities===

The products above have quite different sets and weights of underlying securities. Because of different definitions of developed and emerging markets, two indexes in the same market segment may have different country holdings. Even within the same countries, market-cap-weighted indexes have different country weights because of different definitions of small-cap by country. Be sure to read the prospectus of each product and, if necessary, do additional research before investing in any of the products above.

      <text bytes="5980" sha1="9osqfz2m5jhie322ivh1zbezw7oddjn" xml:space="preserve">'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an active investment strategy that adjusts a portfolio's [[asset class]] weightings according to short term forecasts of expected returns. The strategy is often considered a moderately active strategy, because managers usually return to the portfolio's original strategic asset mix when it has achieved short-term profits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tacticalassetallocation.asp| title=Tactical Asset Allocation - TAA| publisher=Investopedia| accessdate=August 10, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many asset allocation [[mutual fund]]s use tactical asset allocation.

==Common tactical asset allocation strategies==

According to a Vanguard paper,&lt;ref name="primer"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://personal.vanguard.com/pdf/flgtaa.pdf| title=A primer on tactical asset allocation strategy evaluation| publisher=Vanguard Group| date=2006| accessdate=August 10, 2023| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190122083355/https://personal.vanguard.com/pdf/flgtaa.pdf| archive-date=January 22, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; most tactical asset allocation uses one or more of the following approaches. All of them use various signals and valuation metrics to set tactical asset allocation weights for asset classes. 

*'''The "Fed model" signals''': This model compares [[stock]] earnings yields (the inverse of the price/earnings [P/E] ratio) to nominal bond yields to to set allocation weights. Clifford Asness detailed several drawbacks to this approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Clifford Asness| url=https://ssrn.com/abstract=381480| title=Fight the Fed Model: The Relationship Between Stock Market Yields, Bond Market Yields, and Future Returns| date=2002| accessdate=August 10, 2023}} Available at SSRN&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Business-cycle/macroeconomic signals''': Signals include term spreads (the yield differential between long- and short term bonds), the credit spread (the yield differential between high- and low-credit-rated corporate bonds), "unexpected inflation," and industrial production.
*'''Fundamental-valuation signals''': Metrics include dividend yield, book/market ratio, and P/E ratio, to determine relative valuation. Another approach is to use the dividend discount model to determine the required rate of return from market prices and projected dividend growth rates.
*'''Momentum signals''': Signals include technical indicators, earnings growth, and changes in trading volumes.
*'''Sentiment signals''': Signals include measures of consumer confidence and margin borrowing.

==Vanguard tactical asset allocation funds==
Vanguard has historically used tactical asset allocation for a limited number of its balanced funds.
 
===Vanguard Managed Payout Distribution Fund===
The Vanguard Managed Payout Distribution Fund employs a tactical asset allocation strategy. The fund is allocated across the following asset class funds, as of December 2014:

*Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund Investor Shares 
*Vanguard Global Minimum Volatility Fund Investor Shares 
*Vanguard Market Neutral Fund Investor Shares
*Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund Investor Shares 
*Vanguard Total International Bond Index Fund Investor Shares 
*Vanguard Emerging Markets Stock Index Fund Investor Shares
*Vanguard Total Bond Market II Index Fund Investor Shares 
*Commodities (The fund invests a portion of its assets in commodities through the use of swap contracts)
 
An investment committee directs the fund's tactical asset allocation strategy. It makes three key asset allocation decisions:&lt;ref name="prospectus"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/889519/000093247114005090/valleyforge485bmerged.htm| title=VANGUARD VALLEY FORGE FUNDS Prospectus| date=2014| p=18| accessdate=August 10, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Identify eligible asset classes and investments for the fund;
* Establish strategic asset allocation ranges specifying the fund's minimum and maximum long-term allocations to eligible asset classes and investments;
* Establishes a short- to intermediate-term asset allocation target for the Fund. The committee’s asset allocation targets govern the portfolio manager’s day-to-day investment decisions for the fund.

The decision making process includes the following tactical strategies:&lt;ref name="prospectus"/&gt;

{{quotation|The investment committee’s decisions are based, in part, on a consideration of a wide range of strategic inputs, which may include some combination of the following factors (or others): the Fund’s prior performance; value at risk and expected shortfall; volatility; macroeconomic factors; current and expected market conditions; cash flows; estimates of changes in the spreads between the expected returns of eligible asset classes and investments; historical and expected correlations between and among asset classes and investments; quantitative modeling of the likelihood that a proposed combination of asset classes and investments will achieve a Fund’s investment objective; and the results of stress tests.}}

===Vanguard Asset Allocation Fund===

Historically, Vanguard ran an asset allocation fund (Vanguard Asset Allocation Fund) that used tactical asset allocation to manage its portfolio allocations. These consisted of varying allocations to an indexed stock portfolio tracking the [[S&amp;P 500 index]], to long-term [[Treasury bonds|treasury bonds]], and to [[Treasury bills|treasury bills]]. The fund existed from 1987 until its merger into the Vanguard Balanced Index Fund in 2012. The fund was a long time component of the Vanguard series of LifeStrategy [[fund of funds|funds of funds]], which included the fund in its allocations from inception through 2011.

You should look at all of your accounts as a unified portfolio to construct a portfolio that is low cost, well diversified, and tax efficient. If this concept is new to you, you might feel overwhelmed by the complexity of maintaining such a portfolio. '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is intended to suggest one way of making things easier.

==Asset allocation==
One of the easiest ways to maintain your portfolio is to categorize by [[asset allocation]]. For example:
{| class=wikitable style="text-align:center" width=570px
! Account
! Domestic&lt;br&gt;stocks
! REITs
! International&lt;br&gt;stocks
! Bonds
! Total
|-
! Taxable
| -
| -
| $14,000
| -
| $14,000
|-
! Roth IRA
| -
|  $9,000
|  $9,000
| -
| $18,000
|-
! 401(k)
|  $49,000
| -
| -
|  $19,000
|  $68,000
|-
! Total
|  $49,000
|  $9,000
|  $23,000
|  $19,000
|  $100,000
|-
! Desired
|  $48,000
|  $8,000
|  $24,000
|   $20,000
|  $100,000
|-
! Difference
|  ($1,000)
| ($1,000)
|   $1,000
|   $1,000
|  -
|}

* You manually enter cells in the rows for Taxable, [[Roth IRA]], and [[401(k)]]. All other cells can be automatically calculated.
* Each cell in the Total row represents the total amount of domestic [[stock]]s, that of [[real estate investment trust]]s (REITs), and so on.
* The Desired row represents the desired amount of dollars in each [[asset class]]. You can calculate this by multiplying the value of your portfolio by the percentages in your target asset allocation.
* The Difference row tells you how far off your portfolio is relative to your desired asset allocation. You can calculate it by subtracting a cell in the Total row from the corresponding cell in the Desired row.

===Sample spreadsheets===
* Here is [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1E28C1YTb1jzi3hSKK3ABGvWgTmjSlO5W/edit?usp=sharing&amp;ouid=103809420707053067543&amp;rtpof=true&amp;sd=true a sample spreadsheet] and [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AdNNA8LuYbRyeomrjqLrj9rOvnlWF_xE/view?usp=sharing documentation] in Google Drive in this style. It includes the additional features above, and can also adjust for the different after-tax value of assets in different accounts, and combine multiple subclasses into one class (so that you may have a target allocation to foreign stocks, and separate targets for developed and emerging markets). A [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jY8AdbIF2Xm4Tdq_z2YAf2Zxd42xxUvh/edit?usp=sharing&amp;ouid=103809420707053067543&amp;rtpof=true&amp;sd=true simpler version] is also available. This version does not track subclasses.
* One important aspect of of maintaining your asset allocation is to do periodic [[rebalancing]]. A sample rebalancing spreadsheet is available from [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AsVSNcUR-B6IdE4tZm0yVk9ObkxsZ2xvNmJpRTB0b0E Google Drive] (by forum member LadyGeek).&lt;ref group="note"&gt;To download, select File --&gt; Download As --&gt; Excel or OpenDocument.&lt;/ref&gt; It uses three example approaches, which you could incorporate into any of the sample spreadsheets.
* [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AueLhNpKZa4XdG4wUEwwU3BmQlNqVkc0cVpLNmhqX1E Asset Allocation Spreadsheet] - A Google spreadsheet created by [[User:Hoppy08520|Hoppy08520]], with a link to documentation, that can help setup a multi-account portfolio.
* [https://github.com/danbuchal/portfolio-tracker/releases Portfolio Tracker] - A Google spreadsheet produced by forum poster 'TrackerDan', with several ways of visualizing your allocation, and near-real-time value updates. Support is in {{Forum link|t=451043|title=A Free Google Sheet for Asset Allocation Tracking}}.

===Suggested improvements===
* You might want to make a separate Target row to keep track of your target allocation. In that case, the Desired row would be the product of the Target row and the total portfolio.
* Similarly, you might make an Actual row to compute your percentage allocation, so that you could compare your target percentages to your actual percentages.
* If you have funds which cover multiple asset classes, you can put each fund in a different row, make an extra column for the total fund value, and have the spreadsheet automatically compute the amount of the fund which is in each class.  This allows you to easily track the effect on your allocation of adding $10,000 to a balanced fund.

===Asset allocation visualized===
[[The Finance Buff]]'s article, [http://thefinancebuff.com/cascading-asset-allocation-method.html Cascading Asset Allocation Method], describes how to select a portfolio's asset allocation by visualizing the process as a top-down hierarchy. The most important selection is at the top (stocks/bonds), which then breaks down into smaller asset classes. Selection of the actual funds is done last, which is at the bottom of the chart. Two spreadsheets are available.

First, forum member 'pradador' has created a spreadsheet which allows you to create a portfolio by following the advice in the article. The spreadsheet is available on Google Drive: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AsVSNcUR-B6IdEJZNE43NHpKQnNPNXFUTk1CZ195dmc Cascading Asset Allocation] (The spreadsheet was further modified by forum member LadyGeek to include error checking.)&lt;ref&gt;{{Forum link| t=106505| title=Cascading Asset Allocation Spreadsheet| author=pradador| date=December 5, 2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

This spreadsheet includes a [[Fixed income | fixed income]] major asset category, which is not mentioned in the article. There is no consensus on the role of fixed income in a portfolio; this depends on your situation. If you consider ''fixed income'' as a bond, then set the percentage of Fixed Income to 0.

There are two tabs:
*Top Down: Starting on the left side and proceed to the right, enter your desired asset allocations to arrive at the percentage of each fund's contribution to your portfolio. The bottom row is reserved for error checking. If you make an entry (the percentages do not add up to 100%), you will see an error message.
*Bottom Up: Use this tab to determine the asset allocation percentages of your portfolio when you know the funds. In the right-most column, enter the percentages and funds. The spreadsheet will work left and arrive at the asset allocations. The blank cell in the lower right-most corner will display an error if the percentage does not add up to 100%.

====How to use a proxy fund====
Google Finance offers historical and real-time securities information using the {{code|GoogleFinance()}} function in Google Sheets.

If you have funds held in a [[Collective Investment Trusts|Collective Investment Trust (CIT)]], in which there is no ticker symbol, then you can use a proxy fund to keep your balance roughly up to date using the GoogleFinance functions in Google spreadsheets.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Proxy fund: A fund used to represent another fund. The C-fund does not have a ticker symbol. In its place, the Vanguard Institutional Index Fund (VINIX) is used to represent the C-fund. The Vanguard fund is the proxy for the C-fund.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, suppose you hold the government's [[Thrift Savings Plan]] C Fund, which is a collective investment trust (CIT) that tracks the S&amp;P 500 index. Find out the closing price of the CIT on the current day, and also find a similar proxy fund, such as Vanguard's institutional index fund (VINIX).

For example, suppose the C Fund's closing price is $23.6602 and Vanguard's VINIX is $167.75. This means that a share of the C Fund is worth 7.08 times a share of VINIX (167.75/23.6602).

To maintain a real-time estimate of your C Fund balance without needing to update the C Fund's share price every day, you can instead take the daily price of VINIX and divide it by the multiplier to get an approximate share price for the C Fund.

For example, these could be the cell along a row in your spreadsheet and this is what you would enter into them.

{| class=wikitable style="text-align:left" 
|+ Implementing a proxy fund
! Cell
! Heading
! Enter
! Notes
|-
| A2
| Shares
| 100
| Enter the number of shares you have in the Collective Index Trust (CIT). As you add or subtract shares from contributions, withdrawals or exchanges, you will need to periodically update this amount.
|-
| B2
| Closing Price
| 23.6602
| Enter the CIT's closing price. You will need to look this up in your plan.
|-
| C2
| Close Date
| 01/03/2014
| Enter the closing date on which you got the "Closing Price" of the CIT in B2. Make sure you enter the date and closing price are in sync, and be sure that the closing price has been updated in case there is a lag between the market close and the posting of the closing prices.
|-
| D2
| Proxy Fund
| VINIX
| Enter the ticker of a fund that is similar to your CIT.
|-
| E2
| Proxy Price
| =INDEX(GoogleFinance(D2, "close", C2); 2; 2)
| This returns the closing price of the proxy fund you selected in D2, on the date C2, which is the same date you recorded the closing price of the CIT.
|-
| F2
| Multiplier
| =E2/B2
| This is the ratio of the Proxy Fund's Price divided by your CIT's price, on the same date.
|-
| G2
| Proxy Fund Current Price
| =GoogleFinance(D2, "price")
| The current price of your proxy fund.
|-
| H2
| CIT Approx Price
| =G2/F2
| This is the approximate calculated share price of the CIT.
|-
| I2
| Balance
| =H2*A2
| The approximate balance you hold in the CIT. This is the approximated price of the CIT multiplied by the number of shares you hold in the CIT.
|-
|}
To keep this reasonably up-to-date and to prevent the "multiplier" from drifting over time, you can periodically replace the date in cell C2 and the actual closing price of the CIT in cell B2.

====Real-time tracking from a website====
Another technique is to find a website that outputs the price of the trust in real-time (or near real-time) and then use the GoogleFinance {{code|ImportHmtl()}} function to "scrape" the HTML from the page.

If the {{code|ImportHtml()}} function can scrape that data cleanly into defined rows and columns with the price landing in a single cell, then you can then use the {{code|INDEX}} function to get the value of a particular cell by referencing its row and column. The Bogleheads forum shows two examples:

*{{Forum link| t=141547| title=GoogleFinance price quotes for TSP Funds}}
*{{Forum link| t=141501| title=How to import TIAA-CREF annuity unit values into Google Docs}}

==Rate of return==
{{See also| Comparing investments#Internal rate of return| Calculating personal returns}}

[[Calculating personal returns]] offers a spreadsheet to calculate investor and portfolio returns. It lets Bogleheads report their personal returns in a uniform manner.

If you know the dates you made your investment contributions and your withdrawals, the {{code|XIRR}} (Internal Rate of Return) spreadsheet function is the best and most accurate method for calculating your rate of return. This method is far more accurate than annual average returns, as contributions and withdrawals (cash flows) are weighted for both time and value.&lt;ref&gt;{{Forum link| t=51221| title=Using XIRR in Excel| date=March 3, 2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;''Internal'' refers to the fact that its calculation does not incorporate environmental factors, for example, the interest rate or inflation. For more, see [[wikipedia:Internal rate of return |Internal rate of return]], from Wikipedia&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Forum link| t=115030 |title=XIRR function again}} has details and a working example.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;{{Forum link| t=115030| title=XIRR function again}} also describes a bug in MS Excel's {{code|XIRR()}} function. This bug is not present in LibreOffice or Google Drive Sheets.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tax lot tracking==
Another use of a spreadsheet is to keep track of share lots in a taxable account, so that you can automatically compute the capital gain or loss when you sell, and easily see which shares should be sold for [[tax loss harvesting]] or to minimize the tax cost of selling. A spreadsheet for tax lots could look like this: 

{| class=wikitable style="text-align:center"
! Date&lt;br&gt;bought
! Amount&lt;br&gt;invested
! Share&lt;br&gt;price
! Shares
! Date&lt;br&gt;sold
! Share&lt;br&gt;price
! Amount&lt;br&gt;received
! Capital&lt;br&gt;gain
|-

| $5000 
| $20.00 
| 250.000 
| 10/31/08 
| $15.00 
| $3750 
| -$1250
|-
| 5/1/08

|}

===Sample spreadsheets===
* Here are three versions of a spreadsheet for tracking tax lots, and computing the capital gains and losses on each sale.  There is a version for [https://web.archive.org/web/20190117214306/http://remarque.org/~grabiner/stockworksheet.xls stocks or ETFs], [https://web.archive.org/web/20190225201418/http://remarque.org/~grabiner/mutualfundworksheet.xls most mutual funds], and [http://remarque.org/~grabiner/fundwithfees.xls funds with purchase and redemption fees]. In a brokerage account, you would make one sheet in a workbook for each holding. The worksheets adjust for stock splits and share class conversions, but if you sell part of a lot, you have to split the lot into two purchases manually.

==Portfolio tools==
{{Main article|Tools and calculators#Portfolio tools|l1= Portfolio tools}}
In addition to the spreadsheets there are various utilities to design and manage portfolios that span multiple accounts. Most tools cannot automatically compose your ideal portfolio, but you can use the tools to enter two or three models that you composed, and then you can compare and contrast the results, looking in particular at the blended expense ratios and the totals of each asset class. 
Two popular tools are: 
*[[Vanguard Portfolio Watch]] is an online tool for Vanguard clients to track asset allocation. 
*[[Tools_and_calculators#Portfolio_tools| Morningstar Instant X-Ray]] is a tool especially useful for breaking down a portfolio into asset allocations and style boxes. Requires a free subscription to use.

Geographically, REIT and real estate securities markets are spread across the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia.&lt;ref name= "Global REIT Chronology"&gt;[http://www.reit.com/Investing/GlobalRealEstateInvesting.aspx Global REIT Chronology], REIT.com &lt;/ref&gt; For a U.S. domiciled investor, '''international REITS''' make up the global market ex U.S securities.

==National REIT markets==

Nations finalizing the adoption of REIT structures since 2010 include Spain, Finland, Hungary, Israel, Dubai, South Africa, Pakistan, Philippines, and Mexico.]]

The United States, in 1960, was the first country to institute the REIT structure for holding commercial real estate. Australia created its REIT structure in 1971. Beginning in 2000 an increasing number of nations have legislated REIT structures.  In international markets, especially emerging markets, a frequent vehicle for investing in commercial real estate is a Real Estate Operating Company (REOC). Whereas a REIT distributes earnings to shareholders, a REOC reinvests earnings into the business.&lt;ref name="Vanguard Institutional"&gt;[https://institutional.vanguard.com/VGApp/iip/site/institutional/researchcommentary/article/CommercialEquityREAnalysis REITs: Effective exposure to commercial real estate?], Vanguard Institutional, 03/23/2011&lt;/ref&gt;  The table below provides a listing of nations now employing REIT structures for securitized real estate investment.

==Role of international REITs in an investment portfolio==
For portfolios that include an allocation to domestic real estate securities, the arguments for inclusion of international reits include:
* Diversifying the risk of a single domestic real estate market by accessing a wider universe of real estate companies. This argument is similar to the basic argument for [[Domestic/International|adding international stocks to a domestic stock portfolio]]. For U.S. investors, domestic real estate securities provide access to about one third of the global real estate markets.
* International real estate markets exhibit lower correlations between regions, thus offering a potential diversification benefit.  Vanguard research indicates that  the rolling annual correlation between international reits and US reits (1990-2010, measured by S&amp;P indexes) ranges from -0.4 to 0.85.&lt;ref name="Vanguard Institutional"/&gt; International reits also provide varying correlations with US stocks, US bonds, US cash, and international securities markets.
* Wilshire argues that target retirement funds employing global real estate allocations should allocate between 7% to 15% of the portfolio to a global real estate index fund.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epra.com/media/Wilshire-Target-Date-Fund-White-Paper-2012.pdf The Role of REITs and Listed Real Estate Equities in Target Date Fund Asset Allocations], Wilshire Associates, March 2012 &lt;/ref&gt;

Caveats regarding using an international REIT fund include the following.
* If you are a total market investor, the international total market index funds hold the market capitalization of international real estate securities.
* An international REIT fund creates an [[Principles of Tax-Efficient Fund Placement|asset location]] issue due to the fact that international reits have comparatively high dividend distribution that is mostly taxed at [[Marginal tax rate|marginal income tax rates]]. The expected high distributions, mostly [[Non-qualified dividends|non-qualified]], suggest that international REITs are candidates for placement in [[Traditional IRA|tax-deferred]] or [[Roth IRA|tax-free]] investment accounts. However, to the extent that income is taxed by local national governments, the fund's dividend distribution may qualify for a [[foreign tax credit]], which is foregone if the fund is held in a tax-advantaged account. In sum, most foreign REIT index funds and ETFs have a foreign tax credit of only 5% of the dividend yield (see, for example, [https://advisors.vanguard.com/VGApp/iip/site/advisor/investments/taxcenter/foreigntaxcredit Vanguard Foreign Tax worksheets] for Vanguard's fund); therefore, the high tax rate is the more important cost factor and the funds are better held in tax-advantaged accounts.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an issue facing investors holding assets in [[Asset allocation in multiple accounts|multiple accounts]], both tax-advantaged and taxable accounts. The tax code recognizes different sources of investment income which are taxed at different rates, or, are taxed at a later time (tax "deferred"). An asset's tax efficiency (the impact of taxes on an investment) is affected by both its expected return and the tax rate on that return.

Some fund types, like total market stock index funds, are extremely tax-efficient, because they produce low dividends (that are mostly [[qualified dividend|qualified]]) and capital gains. By contrast, bond funds can be extremely tax-inefficient, because the interest they produce every year is taxed at your full marginal tax rate. Other tax-inefficient investments are REITs, small value funds, and actively managed funds that frequently churn their holdings. Put tax-inefficient funds into tax-advantaged accounts to the extent possible.

All investors must pay their legally required taxes. This article describes how to minimize taxes by placing investments appropriately in tax-deferred or taxable (pay taxes now) accounts.
{{Warning|Determining your [[Asset allocation|asset allocation]] (% stocks / % bonds), which sets your portfolio's level of [[Risk#Asset Allocation | acceptable risk]], ''is the single most influential decision you can make'' on your portfolio's performance. Only consider taxes &lt;u&gt;after&lt;/u&gt; you have configured your total portfolio.}}{{Notice|Tax regulations can be complex and contain subtle details that may escape inexperienced investors. If this article seems overly complicated, then just remember a few key points:
*Set your asset allocation first; taxes come second. If you do not have any funds which can be put in a location to reduce your tax bill, then stop here. You have done the best you can.
*Tax rates and brackets change frequently. What was a logical tax location one year may turn out to be a poor choice a few years later. Consider if it is worth the effort (added complexity) to take this approach.
*Consider the [[#Criticisms_of_this_tax_placement_strategy|various criticisms]] of the suggested tax placement strategy.}}

==General strategy==
Because tax regulations are complex, and there are a lot of possible investment scenarios, the suggestions in this article do not apply to everyone. While there is no "one rule fits all" concept, the strategies here are mostly aimed at investors in the accumulation phase (saving for retirement).

In considering '''asset location''' keep the following points in mind:

*If your investments are &lt;u&gt;all&lt;/u&gt; in tax-advantaged accounts, fund placement will not have a large impact on your returns. ''Tax-advantaged'' accounts include tax-deferred accounts, such as traditional [[401(k)]], [[403(b)]], and [[Traditional IRA]], and the tax-free Roth versions of those accounts such as [[Roth IRA]].
*If you have a taxable account, first consider whether it is better to move the money into a tax-advantaged account by contributing more to a tax-advantaged account.
*If you are already contributing the maximum to every tax-advantaged account available to you, and you have additional funds to invest, you need to consider tax efficiency when choosing your funds.
*You should always establish an [[Emergency fund | emergency fund]] first, and then fund your work-based retirement account, HSA, or IRA ''before'' your taxable accounts. Tax-advantaged accounts are the most tax-efficient accounts, and you should not overlook them.

See [[Prioritizing investments]] for more on the points above.

If you have both tax-advantaged (retirement) and taxable accounts, you generally want to hold less tax-efficient assets in a tax-advantaged account and more tax-efficient assets in a taxable account. You need to consider both the return and the tax rate. With higher bond yields, conventional wisdom is to hold bonds in tax-advantaged accounts. Today low yields are common, and a bond fund with an expected return of less than 1% can be more tax efficient than a stock fund with an expected return of 7% even though the bond fund's return is taxed at a higher rate. It is best to understand the basic principles and then apply them to your situation.

===Advantages of taxable accounts===
The advantages for holding stocks in a taxable account include:

* Lower tax rates. In tax-advantaged accounts, all investments are taxed equally (not at all in a tax-free account, or only on withdrawal in a tax-deferred account). In taxable accounts, almost all the return on bonds are taxed at your full rate every year, but most of the return on stocks is tax-favored:
** Increases in stock prices do not lead to any tax until the stocks are sold, which offers an additional way for you to defer taxes.
** When you sell stocks, the tax is usually at the lower rate for long-term capital gains.
** If the stocks pay dividends, they are taxed every year, but [[Qualified dividend|qualified dividends]] are taxed at a lower rate.
* You can [[Tax loss harvesting | harvest losses]].
* You can [[Donating appreciated securities | donate appreciated shares]] to charity, avoiding all taxes.
* Estate planning; there is a potential for [[Step-up in basis|stepped-up cost basis]] upon death.

For example, suppose that you hold $10,000 in a stock index fund for 30 years, and it yields 2%, all qualified dividends are taxed at 15%, while earning 6% in increased stock prices for a pre-tax return of 8%. Every year, you pay 0.30% tax on the dividend, and reinvest the other 1.7%. After 30 years, you have $92,570, with a basis of $28,230 including reinvested dividends.

When you sell, you pay $9,651 tax on the $64,340 capital gain, for a final value of $82,719, an annual return of 7.30%. Despite the 15% tax rate, your returns were only 9% less than the tax-free rate because you deferred taxes on the capital gains. If you harvested losses, donated some of the stock to charity, or left some to your heirs, your return would be even higher.

The advantages for holding bonds in a taxable account include:

* Bonds have a lower expected return than stocks, and so sometimes a lower tax cost.
* Switching placement when necessary does not incur a large capital gains tax. If you hold stocks in a taxable account instead, large built-up unrealized capital gains makes it very difficult for you to switch, even if switching would otherwise be beneficial.
* Nominal [[Treasury bonds|treasury bonds]], [[TIPS]], and in-state [[Municipal bonds|muni bonds]] are not subject to the state income tax.
* The effective tax rate on muni bonds is usually much lower than the highest marginal tax rate on ordinary income.
* Interest from muni bonds is not included in Adjusted Gross Income (AGI), which determines eligibility for many income tax deductions and credits, whereas dividends and capital gains are included in AGI.

===Tax rates===
Tax rates are shown below:&lt;ref group="note"&gt; Mutual fund distributions and the tax consequences of selling funds are explained below:
*Short-term capital gains distributions are realized gains on securities held for one year or less. Your short-term gains are taxed at ordinary income tax rates. Mutual fund short-term gain distributions are included in a fund's [[Ordinary dividend | ordinary dividend]] distribution; therefore, capital losses may not be subtracted from these distributions when computing taxes.
*[[Capital gains distribution |Long-term capital gains distributions]] are realized gains on securities held for more than one year. You report these on tax Schedule D along with any other capital gains, and can offset them with capital losses.
*[[Qualified dividend]]s are the ordinary dividends.

A portion of your [[Ordinary dividend | ordinary dividend]] may be nonqualified because it can include items like these:
*'''Taxable interest'''. When a mutual fund receives taxable interest, the income gets paid out as a dividend. It is a dividend when it goes out of the mutual fund, but it was not a dividend when it came into the mutual fund, so it cannot be a qualified dividend.
*'''Nonqualified dividends'''. Your mutual fund may receive dividends that are nonqualified. For example, the mutual fund may sell shares just 35 days after buying them, but after receiving a dividend. The mutual fund has to hold the shares at least 61 days to have a qualified dividend. Any amount the mutual fund receives as a nonqualified dividend gets paid to you as a nonqualified dividend.
*'''Short-term capital gain'''. When a mutual fund has a short-term capital gain, it pays this amount to the mutual fund shareholders as an ordinary dividend.
*'''Holding mutual fund shares less than 61 days'''. Any dividend you receive on mutual fund shares held less than 61 days is a nonqualified dividend, even if the mutual fund reports that amount to you as a qualified dividend. You do not have to buy the shares 61 days before the dividend is paid, but the total amount of time you hold the shares (including time before and after the dividend) has to be at least 61 days.

Almost all of the dividends distributed by [[REIT |equity REITS]] come in the form of non-qualified dividends. Non-qualified dividends are taxed at marginal income tax rates.

*[[Tax loss harvesting | When you sell at a loss]] you will either offset capital gains which would have otherwise been taxed at your capital gains rate or you will offset income (up to $3,000 maximum per year) which would have otherwise been taxed at your marginal income tax rate, or both. If you offset capital gains that would have otherwise not been taxed at all (because your capital gains tax rate is 0%) then this part of the tax loss harvest may be an outright loss.
*The [[ACA net investment income tax|Affordable Care Act]] imposes a Medicare surcharge of 3.8% on all net investment income (NII) once the taxpayer's adjusted gross income exceeds $200,000 (single) or $250,000 (married); while this tax is not part of the income tax, it has the same effect on investors as a higher tax rate.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tax efficiency of various asset classes ==
The table below shows the ''approximate'' tax efficiency ranking of various asset class funds.

Given reasonable assumptions, the "Very inefficient", "Moderately inefficient" , and "Efficient" categories separate fairly clearly. The exact ordering within the categories depends not only on future tax policy, but also on assumptions about turnover, future returns, dividend yields, and qualified dividends.

A more complete discussion of bonds and bond funds, balanced funds, and stocks and stock funds follows.

|}
====Tax efficiency of bonds====
Some investors see bonds or bond funds as tax-inefficient because almost all of the return comes from the dividend yield, which is fully taxed as ordinary income.&lt;ref group="note"&gt; Most bond funds also periodically distribute modest amounts of short term and long term gains.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, stocks get most of their return from price appreciation, which is not taxed until the stocks are sold and is taxed at the capital-gains tax rate. Therefore, these investors regard bonds as being less tax-efficient than stock index funds (which rarely sell stock) and hold bonds in tax-advantaged accounts when possible.

However, low-yielding bonds do not have much return to be taxed, and because they do not grow as fast as other investments, an equal percentage lost from an investment is a smaller dollar loss; this makes low-yielding bonds somewhat more tax-efficient. Therefore, some other investors do just the opposite: they hold stocks with a higher expected return in tax-advantaged accounts when possible. You have to strike a balance between the expected return and the tax rate.

[[Treasury bonds]] are exempt from state taxes, making them tax-inefficient for federal taxes, but they may be desirable taxable investments for investors who pay high state taxes but low federal taxes. [[TIPS]] have the same tax-efficiency as their treasury bond equivalents; however, because you need to pay taxes annually on the inflation component, and you do not receive this until the bond matures or is sold, this cash flow problem creates an additional reason to hold individual TIPS (as opposed to a fund) in a tax-advantaged account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.projectinvested.com/investor-guides/investorsguide-to-u-s-treasury-securities/| title=Investor's Guide to U.S. Treasury Securities| publisher=project:invested| accessdate=June 5, 2023}} &lt;/ref&gt;

[[Municipal bonds|Municipal bond]] funds have a hidden cost; while their interest incomes are not subject to federal tax, they usually earn less than [[Corporate bonds|corporate]] or treasury bond funds of comparable risk. (The risk may be of a different type; intermediate-term municipal bonds have more credit risk than long-term treasury bonds, but less interest-rate risk, and thus may have a similar after-tax yield.) There are special rules regarding the taxation of [[Social Security]] benefits - municipal bond interest in a taxable account may result in additional [[Taxation of Social Security benefits|Social Security benefits being taxable]].&lt;ref group="note"&gt; For a general guide to the taxation of municipal bonds, see [https://www.projectinvested.com/investor-guides/investors-guide-to-municipal-bonds/ Investor's Guide to Municipal Bonds], project:invested. Some municipal securities, including Build America Bonds, are taxable bonds. Interest income from Private activity municipal securities (and mutual funds that invest in them) is subject to the federal alternative minimum tax if the taxpayer is required to pay this tax.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tax efficiency of balanced funds====
[[Balanced fund|Balanced funds]] (stocks and bonds) are very popular among individual investors. These funds hold a variety of asset classes in one simple fund instead of several. They have a variety of names such as balanced, [[Vanguard LifeStrategy funds|lifestyle]], or [[Target date retirement funds|target retirement funds]]. Since these funds include both stocks and bonds their tax efficiency sits somewhere between stocks and bonds.

If you have a balanced fund in a taxable account, you cannot sell only the bonds (to hold bonds in a different account, or to hold fewer bonds, or to hold a different type of bonds); you have to sell the whole fund, which can result in realizing a capital gain.

In a taxable account, you pay tax on the bond dividends at ordinary income rates; in addition, you lose the option to harvest losses of individual asset classes. The more efficient strategy is to own the individual asset classes in separate funds and in their most tax-efficient locations.

====Tax efficiency of stocks====
Stock funds can be tax-inefficient if they generate a lot of capital gains, particularly short-term gains. They are also less efficient if they pay high dividends (although under current tax law, if most of the dividend stream is a [[Qualified dividend | "qualified" dividend]], the tax burden is reduced.) Actively managed stock funds with high turnover sell most of their stocks with gains, generating large taxable gains. Even low-turnover active funds tend to generate more gains than index funds in the same asset class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author1=Clemens Sialm| author2=Hanjiang Zhang| url=https://ssrn.com/abstract=2368625| title=Tax Efficient Asset Management: Evidence from Equity Mutual Funds| date=December 16, 2013}} Available at SSRN. &lt;/ref&gt;

[[Indexing|Index funds]] must also sell stocks which leave the index. Because both [[Small caps|small-cap]] and value stocks can migrate to a large-cap or a growth stock index when they rise in price, small-cap and value indexes tend to generate realized capital gains. [[Tax-managed fund comparison|Tax-managed funds]] (which are willing to deviate from the index to minimize taxes), [[Exchange-traded funds|ETFs]], and funds with an ETF class can eliminate many of these realized gains. Value indexes are less tax-efficient than growth or blend indexes because they have higher dividend yields; small-cap funds have lower dividend yields but fewer qualified dividends.

[[Real estate investment trust|REITs]], although they trade as stocks, must distribute almost all their income, and the income is taxable at the non-qualified dividend rate except for a small portion (historically about 15%) which is non-taxable because it compensates for depreciation of the property. Under the 2018 tax law changes, some of the income from REITs is treated as qualified business income; only 80% of that income is taxed.

If all else is equal, [[Domestic/International|international funds]] have a small tax advantage over US funds, because they are eligible for the [[Foreign tax credit | foreign tax credit]]. All else is not necessarily equal; if an emerging market is reclassified as developed, an emerging-markets index fund will have to sell all its stock in that country, infrequently generating a large capital gain. A fund including both developed and emerging markets such as [{{Vf | 0770}} Vanguard FTSE All-World ex-US Index Fund] or [{{Vf | 0113}} Vanguard Total International Index Fund] avoids this risk.

== Assigning asset classes to different accounts==
Treat your entire portfolio as a whole (include spouse).

*Consider what you already own. It may be inadvisable to pay additional taxes just to get a more tax efficient location. Even if your current location is not ideal it may be better to stick with certain aspects of it. This could mean keeping tax inefficient investments in a taxable account. Over time you can reduce the effect of a historically imposed asset location by not automatically reinvesting taxable distributions. Take any distributions in cash and reinvest them in a tax efficient manner.

=== Step 1: Categorize your portfolio's tax efficiency ===
Understand the tax consequences of holding each of your chosen investment assets based on the tax-efficiency of each asset class.

=== Step 2: Place your least tax efficient funds first ===
Fill your ''tax-advantaged'' accounts with your least efficient funds. Exhaust these accounts before putting these funds into your taxable account; if you run out of room, consider more tax-efficient alternatives, such as a stock index fund rather than an active fund or a muni bond fund rather than a total-market bond fund. An example portfolio with three asset classes (a total market US stock market index fund; a total market international stock market index fund, and an intermediate taxable bond fund,) is shown below. ''Note that in this scenario, we assume bond interest rates have a higher tax cost than stock investments.''

|+'''An example using three asset classes'''
||[[File:Slide2.JPG|center|650px]]
|}

=== Step 3: Placing international stock funds in the taxable account ===
It is sometimes possible to get tax credit for foreign taxes paid from international stock funds, but you lose this opportunity in tax-advantaged accounts. If all else is equal, the existence of the credit may make it advantageous to prioritize these funds in the taxable account. Whether or not the foreign tax credit is enough depends on factors such as the the percentage of the fund's foreign source income component, the foreign tax rate, the percentage of the foreign dividends that are qualified, and your US marginal tax bracket.

{|style="border-collapse: collapse; border: 1px solid #a2a9b1" &lt;!-- set border="1" to see table boundaries--&gt;
|+'''(Example) Consider foreign tax credit'''
||[[File:Slide3.JPG|center|650px]]
|}

=== Step 4: Place high growth stock funds ===
If all else is equal (and it often is not, because you may have different options in your 401(k) and your Roth IRA), it is slightly better to have the fund with the highest expected return in your Roth account or HSA, because these accounts are free from Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs),&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Roth IRAs are not subject to the RMD when held by the original owner, or after the owner's death, when rolled over into a spousal Roth IRA. Non spousal inheritors of a Roth IRA are subject to RMD rules.&lt;/ref&gt; are not counted as income for making Social Security taxable, and probably are less subject to the risk of changing tax rates.&lt;ref group="note"&gt; For simplicity, many people manage their asset allocation without regard to taxes. When Roth IRA accounts are much smaller than tax-deferred accounts this approximation works well. But it can be noted that moving the asset with the greatest expected future value from tax-deferred to a tax-free account does increase the risk/return of the investor. A simple way to view this [[Tax-adjusted asset allocation|tax-adjusted allocation]] for an investor in the 25% tax bracket is that the government is a 25% owner of the tax-deferred account. When moving an asset increases the investor's ownership of a high risk/return asset from 75% to 100% (in a Roth IRA), the overall portfolio risk-return increases as well.&lt;/ref&gt;

|+'''(Example) High growth stock fund placement'''
||[[File:Slide4.JPG|center|650px]]
|}

=== Step 5: Place tax efficient funds last ===
Tax-efficient funds are fine in any account. It is particularly easy to regularly [[rebalancing|rebalance]] your stock/bond ratio if you have enough room in your tax-advantaged accounts to hold some of your tax-efficient stock fund, because the stocks and bonds can be exchanged without tax consequence. Rebalancing in a taxable account is often best done by investing new money so that you can avoid capital gains.

|+'''(Example) Tax efficient fund placement'''

|}

==Criticisms of this tax placement strategy==
Because they have higher returns, equities can effectively expand your tax-advantaged space, leading to higher tax savings later on despite higher tax bills in the present. This is particularly true at low bond yields, when the tax penalty from bonds in taxable is not as high as it has been in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{forum link| p=1866211| title=Re: Delete Wiki on Tax-Efficient Asset Location}}, direct link to relevant post.&lt;/ref&gt;

The situation may change in retirement, when you withdraw the funds for income (decumulation phase). It is possible, under some combinations of lifetime investment results and lifetime individual tax situations, to be better off doing the opposite of the strategy recommended here.&lt;ref&gt;{{forum link| p=1858213| title=Re: Delete Wiki on Tax-Efficient Asset Location}}, direct link to relevant post.&lt;/ref&gt;

This article may be biased towards investors who can fill tax-advantaged space and are looking to invest more. However, some investors (especially those just starting out) cannot fill all this space. This can make this strategy confusing and possibly counterproductive if, for example, someone is buying international equities in taxable space without filling tax-advantaged space just to get the foreign tax credit.&lt;ref&gt;{{forum link| p=1857006| title=Re: Delete Wiki on Tax-Efficient Asset Location}}, direct link to relevant post.&lt;/ref&gt;

This article says that cash and low-yielding bonds are tax efficient, but then contradicts this somewhat by then classifying "most bonds" as tax inefficient. When interest rates are low, bonds are more tax-efficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{forum link| p=1857264| title=Re: Delete Wiki on Tax-Efficient Asset Location}}, direct link to relevant post. Also, the following post.&lt;/ref&gt; If bonds are tax-efficient now, and then yields rise to make them less tax-efficient, you can go from bonds in taxable to bonds in tax-advantaged with little, no, or negative tax cost; therefore, it is reasonable to hold bonds in a taxable account now and switch later if appropriate. In contrast, switching from stocks to bonds in taxable will result in a significant tax cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{forum link| p=1857293| title=Re: Delete Wiki on Tax-Efficient Asset Location}}, direct link to relevant post.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appendix: comparison of hypothetical tax costs ==
For buy and hold investors, the tax cost of holding a fund depends on how much the fund generates in taxable distributions, and the tax rate on those distributions. For long-term holdings, estimation of tax costs necessarily depends on assumptions about the expected returns and future tax policy, such as that long-term gains will continue to be taxed at a lower rate than short-term gains or bond interest; or that the tax preference for[[Qualified dividend | "qualified dividends"]] will extend into the distant future. The following tax costs math helps identify high tax cost candidates for tax-advantaged accounts.

Table 1 assumptions use historical data from Vanguard's index funds, which is used as a guide for qualified dividends, and the relative yields of value, small-cap, and tax-managed funds. Future capital gains are uncertain, but the table now assumes that all ETFs will avoid capital gains, as most ETFs have done so. Interest for bond funds is based on historical rates, not current rates, because the numbers are easy to measure; a bond which has a 6% yield loses 1.32% to taxes in a 22% tax bracket whether that is the current yield on a short-term bond or a long-term bond. The "tax cost" listed for municipal bonds is the hidden cost, the amount you lose in returns to avoid paying the tax; it is based on an assumption that municipal bonds yield 75% as much as taxable bonds of comparable risk.

Moreover, Table 1 is based on the assumption that foreign dividend yields will remain higher than US yields, as has been true since 2008; foreign yields are assumed to be 1.5 times US stock yields (before foreign taxes are withheld). ''If foreign yields become equal to US yields, then the tax costs of foreign funds must be multiplied by 2/3. Thus, in the table, US and foreign funds are about equally tax-efficient, but if foreign yields become lower, foreign funds will be somewhat more tax-efficient.''

There are two types of tax costs: the cost you pay every year, and the costs you pay when you sell. Bond funds have little or no tax cost when you sell, since almost all the return from bonds is from interest. When you sell a stock fund, you will pay capital-gains tax on the difference between the total amount you invested (including reinvested dividends) and the current value.

Table 2 indicates the additional cost for the capital-gains tax when you sell, assuming that you pay taxes on the distribution and reinvest the after-tax portion of the distribution; because it is a one-time cost, the effect is annualized. For example, if you hold an investment for 30 years and lose 10% to taxes when you sell, that is equivalent to losing 0.35% every year. If you sell the fund, your cost will be the sum of the Table 1 and Table 2 costs. However, you would not pay the Table 2 cost on any stock which you either leave to your heirs or donate to charity, and so may not pay that cost on your full investment. In particular, you might estimate your total tax cost by using the low-return line in Table 2; if stock returns are high, you will have a large taxable account and will reduce the tax cost by taking longer to deplete it or by not spending it all during your lifetime.

The tables use a 15% tax on qualified dividends and capital gains for an investor in the 22% bracket, and 23.8% (including the 3.8% Medicare surtax) on qualified dividends and capital gains, 40.8% on ordinary investment income, for an investor in the top 37% bracket. The final column of the second table (in the top tax bracket) assumes a tax rate of 0.46% for the tax-efficient fund, and 1.50% for the tax-inefficient fund. The [[Foreign tax credit | foreign tax credit]] is added to the dividend yield before computing taxes; for example, if a fund had $100 withheld in foreign taxes on dividends, and you pay $20 in taxes on the withheld dividends, you get a $100 credit for a net benefit of $80. Although not tabulated, keep in mind that investors in the lower tax brackets (12% or lower) pay no tax at all on qualified dividends and capital gains, and reap higher after-tax returns, outside of tax-exempt municipal bonds, in all asset classes.

===Example===
An investor in the 22% marginal tax bracket wants to compare the tax efficiency of a total-market index fund and a bond fund yielding 3% (0.66% tax cost). Because these funds are likely to be sold at some point, they can use Table 2 to project an estimate of the range (depending upon whether future returns are low or high) of the total annualized cost. The estimate shows that holding the bond fund in a tax-deferred account is likely to be slightly better over a long holding period; if the stock market returns are high, most of the stock will not be sold.

Both instruments offer inflation protection. The Treasury Department has an excellent [http://treasurydirect.gov/indiv/products/prod_tipsvsibonds.htm comparison table], shown below, but their language is difficult to understand.

== Market price fluctuation ==
After TIPS are issued, they can be bought and sold on the secondary market. If the real interest rate goes down, the previously-issued TIPS with higher real rates go up in value. They can be sold on the secondary market for their true market value. Since there is no secondary market for I-Bonds, they can only be redeemed at accrued value from the U.S. Treasury. If you have high fixed rate I-Bonds, your best option would probably be to hold on to them until maturity. '''Advantage: TIPS'''.

On the other hand, if the real interest rate goes up, I-Bonds can be redeemed at accrued value anytime after you've held them for at least 12 months (you'd lose the last three months' interest if redeemed prior to five years), while TIPS go down in value. '''Advantage: I-Bonds'''.

== Pricing transparency ==
The TIPS prices (and yields) are set by the market. The I-Bonds fixed rates are set by the U.S. Treasury. As the bond issuer, the U.S. Treasury has an incentive to set the fixed rates on I-Bonds as low as they feel they can to still reach their desired sales goals. Investors do not necessarily get a competitive yield from I-Bonds. '''Advantage: TIPS'''.
 
== Purchase limits and fees ==
There is no practical limit for purchasing TIPS. I-Bonds are limited to $10,000 in TreasuryDirect  per Social Security number and $5,000 in paper bonds purchased with IRS tax refund. TIPS can also be purchased through a mutual fund. I-Bonds cannot be bought through a mutual fund. TIPS can be bought in an IRA. I-Bonds cannot be bought in an IRA (they are already tax-deferred). '''Advantage: TIPS'''.

There is no fee for purchasing I-Bonds. There is no fee for purchasing TIPS at auction from TreasuryDirect or through certain brokerage firms if the order is placed online. As of May 2008, Fidelity&lt;ref&gt;[http://personal.fidelity.com/products/trading/Commissions_Margin_Rates/Commissions_Margin_Rates_Bonds.shtml.cvsr Fidelity Online Bond Trade Concessions]&lt;/ref&gt; and Schwab&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schwab.com/public/schwab/home/fees_commissions/commission_schedule?refid=P-1357516&amp;refpid=P-1357507#FixedIncome Schwab Fixed Income Commissions]&lt;/ref&gt; charge no fee for auction orders placed online. Vanguard Brokerage Services&lt;ref&gt; [https://personal.vanguard.com/us/accounttypes/general/ATSBrokerageAcctFeesContent.jsp Vanguard Brokerage Services Account fees and commissions]&lt;/ref&gt; charges $10 for online auction orders unless you are a Voyager client or higher. All brokers charge a markup for secondary market orders.  If you hold a TIPS mutual fund, you will pay a management fee; Vanguard charges 0.20%, and 0.11% for Admiral shares.  '''Advantage: I-Bonds'''.

== Inflation adjustment ==
I-Bonds are adjusted for inflation every six months. TIPS are adjusted for inflation every day. '''Advantage: TIPS'''.

== Interest accrual and payments ==
Interest on I-Bonds is accrued until the bonds are redeemed. TIPS pay out interest every six months. Whether one is better than another depends on whether the investor needs the interest payment or not.

== Tax treatment ==
I-Bonds are tax deferred. Taxes are due in the year in which the I-Bonds are redeemed, unless the investor elects to pay tax on the interests every year.   If the I-Bonds are used to pay educational expenses, the interest may be fully or partially tax-free, depending on your income&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p970.pdf IRS Publication 970, Tax Benefits for Education]&lt;/ref&gt;.  Interest payments and inflation adjustments on TIPS are taxable every year. For this reason, it is often suggested that investors hold TIPS in a tax-deferred account. There is no practical way to hold I-Bonds in a tax deferred account. '''Advantage: I-Bonds'''.

==A note on negative real rates ==
The fixed rate component of both TIPS and I-Bonds is based on real interest rates, which are normally positive. Real interest rates can sometimes go negative, however. When real interest rates are negative, the fixed rate on TIPS is also negative.

However, the fixed rate component of the I-Bond has a floor at 0% and cannot go negative. This is a large advantage of I-Bonds when purchasing during a period of negative real interest rates. You can view current levels of real interest rates [http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/Pages/TextView.aspx?data=realyield here]. '''Advantage: I-Bonds'''

==Three-fund lazy portfolios==
{{Main|Three-fund portfolio}}
A number of popular authors and columnists have suggested [[Three-fund_portfolio|three-fund]] lazy portfolios. These usually consist of three equal parts of bonds (total bond market or TIPS), total US market and total international market. While the "% allocation" is different from those listed below, these funds typically make up the core of Vanguard's [[Vanguard target retirement funds|Target Retirement]] and [[Vanguard_LifeStrategy_funds|Lifestrategy]] funds.

In addition, there are several close alternatives to these funds, especially when purchasing through Vanguard. For example, the "Vanguard Inflation-Protected Securities Fund" also has a short term alternative, "Vanguard Short-Term Inflation-Protected Securities Index Fund" (tickers [{{Vf | 1967}} VTIPX] or [{{Vf | 0567}} VTAPX]) which can offer slightly less volatility in NAV.

==Core four portfolios==
As [[Rick Ferri]] proposed on the Bogleheads forum, the 'Core Four'&lt;ref name="Core Four"&gt;{{forum link| t=10413| title=The Core Four| date=December 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; are four funds which form the "cornerstone" of a portfolio.

[[Rick Ferri | Rick]] proposes that investors first determine their bond allocation. With the remaining funds, allocate 50% to US stock, 40% to international and 10% to [[REIT]].&lt;ref&gt;{{forum link| p=2519915| title=Rick Ferri looking to internationalize his portfolio| date=June 11, 2015| author=[[Rick Ferri]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, for 60/40 and 80/20 portfolios, you would end up with the following&lt;ref name="Rick Ferri Index Portfolios"/&gt;:

[[Rick Ferri | Rick]] stresses that the exact allocation percentages are not important; to the nearest 5% is fine.&lt;ref name="Core Four" /&gt;

The Core Four is just a low cost foundation for your portfolio. You could add a slice of value stocks (US and/or International). You could split the bond portion between Treasury Inflation Protected Securities and nominal bonds, which would result in a slightly more conservative version of [[#David Swensen's lazy portfolio|David Swensen's model portfolio]] (less international stock and less REIT, but otherwise the same four base funds plus TIPS.

==More lazy portfolios==
Beyond the simple three- and four-fund lazy portfolios are more complex portfolios. These are still "lazy" in that they contain enough bonds (typically 30-40%) to allow you to maintain the same [[asset allocation]] for much of your accumulation phase. The more complex funds add REITs, and [[Slice and dice |'slice and dice']] the US and/or International stocks, adding large and small value to the mix. In some of the cases outlined below, a simpler portfolio can accomplish similar goals. For example, you can [[Value tilting - stock |'tilt']] away from a total stock market fund by adding a small cap value fund.

===Bill Schultheis's "Coffeehouse" portfolio===

[[Bill Schultheis]] made this simple seven-fund portfolio popular in his book [[Special:BookSources/978-0-9765857-0-1|''The Coffeehouse Investor'']]. He advocates 40% in a total market bond fund and 10% each in various stock funds. You can find more information at [https://www.coffeehouseinvestor.com/coffeehouse-beans/coffeehouse-portfolios/ The Coffeehouse Investor]. The Coffeehouse Portfolio contains only 10% international stocks (17% of total equities). It slices up the domestic portion, but uses a total international fund.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Discussed in {{ forum link | t = 43345 | title = Three Index Funds vs "The Coffeehouse Portfolio" ? | author = Shaoya | date = September 20, 2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===William Bernstein's "Coward's" portfolio===

He introduced the [http://www.efficientfrontier.com/ef/996/cowards.htm Coward's Portfolio] in 1996. The "coward" refers not to risk tolerance but to the strategy of hedging your bets and having slices of a number of asset classes. This portfolio is similar to the Coffeehouse Portfolio, except that it uses short term bonds, and divides the international portion into equal slices of Europe, Pacific and [[Emerging market stocks|Emerging markets]].

===Frank Armstrong's "Ideal Index" portfolio===
Frank Armstrong, author of [[Special:BookSources/978-0-8144-7250-7|''The Informed Investor'']], proposed this portfolio in an [https://moneycentral.msn.com/content/P128311.asp MSN Money article]{{dead link}}. It contains a smaller allocation to bonds, and a much larger allocation to international stocks (in fact the equities, excluding REIT, are split 50/50 between domestic and international). Like Bernstein he advocates short term bonds. If the domestic slices were replaced by a total market fund, this portfolio would be very close to the three-fund portfolios, with a slice of REIT added.

==Permanent Portfolio==
{{See also| Craig Rowland|J. M. Lawson}}
Free-market investment analyst Harry Browne devised the Permanent Portfolio in the 1980s, as a buy-and-hold portfolio that contains a healthy allocation to gold. The portfolio holds equal allocations of domestic stocks, gold, short-term treasury bonds, and long term treasury bonds.&lt;ref&gt;[https://earlyretirementextreme.com/wiki/index.php?title=Permanent_Portfolio Permanent Portfolio - Early Retirement Extreme Wiki]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group = "note"&gt;Discussed in {{ forum link | t = 15434 | title = Updated Modification of Harry Browne Permanent Portfolio | author = allenmickers | date = Mar 26, 2008}} and {{ forum link | t = 61964 | title = Harry Browne Permanent Portfolio Discussion (Cont'd) | date = Oct 23, 2010 | author = MediumTex}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Forum members [[Craig Rowland]] and [[J. M. Lawson]] have written a book, [[Special:BookSources/978-1-118-28825-2|''The Permanent Portfolio: Harry Browne's Long-Term Investment Strategy'']], detailing every aspect of the Permanent Portfolio.

You can build this portfolio with an investment in a low cost US total stock market index fund, along with direct investments in gold bullion coins, US treasury bills, and US treasury bonds. Or alternatively, with low-cost [[Exchange-traded funds| exchange-traded funds]].

If you have a sizable taxable account, it is possible to '''place a cash needs requirement''', such as an [[Emergency fund | emergency fund]] or home down payment, '''in a tax-advantaged account''' and improve the overall tax efficiency of an investment portfolio.

{{Notice|
Placing emergency funds in volatile accounts can be risky. Consider that the stock market may drop 50% when you need the money the most, forcing you to withdraw from the tax-advantaged account.&lt;ref&gt;{{forum link| t=65387| title=Emergency funds| date=December 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the taxable account should be twice as large as your cash needs. If it is smaller, keep a proportional portion of your cash needs in cash.
}}

==How it works==

Suppose you have $15,000 in your portfolio with additional $5,000 as an emergency fund. Then you could have:

* Taxable&lt;br&gt;$10,000 tax-efficient stock index funds
* Tax-advantaged account, such as [[401(k)]]&lt;br&gt;$5,000 money market fund (your emergency fund)&lt;br&gt;$5,000 bond fund

Now, suppose you need $5,000 in an emergency. You sell $5,000 from the stock index funds in your taxable account and exchange the money market fund for similar stock funds in your tax-advantaged account. You are left with:

* Taxable&lt;br&gt;$5,000 tax-efficient stock index funds
* Tax-advantaged account, such as 401(k)&lt;br&gt;$5,000 stock funds&lt;br&gt;$5,000 bond fund

Notice that you have not changed the asset allocation at all.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;
''White Coat Investor'' commented in this {{Forum link| p=2686420| title=Buying a house in 2-4 years; what do I do with my mutual funds?}} on the transfer from an existing investment in equity to a safer option for a house down payment:
{{blockquote|The main thing is to consider your options in the event of a huge bear market. If the market drops 50%, what will you do? Here are some choices:

# Don't buy the house and just keep renting until the stocks recover and future savings gets you back to where you want to be.
# Maybe houses will be cheaper in an economic downturn and you can still buy it with your decreased amount.
# Maybe houses will be cheaper and you can use a mortgage with &lt; 20% down, leaving your investments intact.
# Maybe you won't buy a house at all.

For some people, for whom these options aren't good choices, should sell their stocks now and put the money in CDs. But there are many people for whom these other options are very realistic alternatives. For them, keeping some or all of the money in stocks is probably okay. The expected return is higher, even if the actual return may not be.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Why it works==
 
The tax efficiency of holding your cash needs in a tax-advantaged account comes in two forms.

===While you do not need the cash===
While you do not need the cash, tax-efficient stock index funds generally yield 2% or so, which are all or mostly qualified dividends; most of the return is from capital gains which are not taxed until you sell. Depending on the interest rate, a typical money market fund yields anywhere from 2% to 5%, and the dividends are all non-qualified dividends. In addition, you can [[Tax loss harvesting | tax loss harvest]] the stock funds.

===When you need the cash===
When you sell a part of the tax-efficient stock index funds, you realize either losses or long-term capital gains. You can deduct losses on your tax return after offsetting capital gains, if any. Long-term capital gains are taxed more favorably than non-qualified dividends.

==Candidates for tax-efficient stock index funds==
The following funds are good candidates in which to invest cash needs, but there are others that are just as good.

US Domestic:
* Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund
* Vanguard Large-Cap Index Fund

International:
* Vanguard Total International Stock Market Index Fund
* Vanguard FTSE All-World ex-US Index Fund

The [[Principles of tax-efficient fund placement]] article prefers placing international stocks in the taxable account. Each pair is suitable for [[Tax loss harvesting | tax loss harvesting]] and avoiding [[wash sale | wash sales]].

==Fine points==

Use [[Specific identification of shares]]. Sell tax lots with losses or tax lots with the highest cost basis that have long-term capital gains. If you do not use [[Specific identification of shares]], it is difficult to minimize tax. In some cases, you might pay more tax on short-term capital gains than on ordinary income, which negates the benefit of placing cash needs in a tax-advantaged account. For this reason, you may want to wait for twelve months before you place cash needs in a tax-advantaged account if you are starting a taxable account now.

Avoid a [[wash sale]]. If you sell shares of the tax-efficient stock index funds with losses and buy "substantially identical" securities in your tax-advantaged account (within 30 days before or after the sale), that is a wash sale. You cannot deduct losses at all in this case. Therefore, you need to find a fund which is not substantially identical to purchase in your tax-advantaged account; preferably, it should be similar, such as an active fund in the same asset class as the index, or a fund tracking a different index. If you prefer to hold the original fund in your tax-advantaged account, you may switch after 31 days.

Make sure your taxable account is large enough. Keep in mind that the stock market tanking by 50% is not uncommon. If your taxable account is not large enough, say twice as large as the cash needs, then you may not have enough money in your taxable account during a market downturn. The market could actually go down by '''more''' than 50%, and that is a risk of this technique if the taxable account does not provide enough cushion. For this reason, you may be able to keep a small amount of cash needs (for example, enough for an emergency) in tax-efficient stock index funds, but you may not want to keep a large amount of cash needs (for example, a home down payment fund) in such potentially volatile investments, unless you have a very large taxable retirement portfolio.

US government mortgage backed securities are tracked by the Bloomberg MBS Index.

==Agency bonds issued by federal government agencies==

Federal agencies issuing bonds include:

* Federal Housing Administration
* [[Government National Mortgage Association|GNMA]] (Ginnie Mae)
* Small Business Administration

These bonds are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government to pay interest and pay back principal at maturity. Some agency issues may be callable and subject to call risk. Agency issues are less liquid than treasury bonds and usually pay a slightly higher interest rate as compensation. Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) bonds are not backed by a government full faith and credit guarantee but rather by the power revenue generated by the Authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://tva.q4ir.com/investment-opportunities/default.aspx| title=TVA - Investment Opportunities| publisher=Tennessee Valley Authority| accessdate=October 2, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Other agencies of the Federal Government issue bonds through the Federal Financing Bank (created in 1973 to lower borrowing costs for smaller governmental agencies).

==Bonds issued by Government Sponsored Enterprise (GSEs)== 

GSEs issuing bonds include:

* Farm Credit Banks
* Farm Credit System Financial Assistance Corporation
* Federal Home Loan Banks
* [[Fannie Mae |Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae)]]
* [[Freddie Mac |Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac)]]
* Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation (Farmer Mac)
* Student Loan Marketing Association (Sallie Mae)

GSEs are not backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. These bonds are subject to both credit risk and default risk and the yield on these bonds is typically slightly higher than on U.S. Treasury bonds.

On September 6, 2008, both Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae were placed into conservatorship by the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), essentially confirming the market's longstanding assumption that the GSEs' debt securities would be backed by the U.S. Government in case of crisis.

==Bond structures==
{{Quote
|quote = '''&lt;u&gt;Agency Bonds Snapshot&lt;/u&gt;'''
*'''Issuer''': Government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs)
*'''Minimum Investment''': Varies—generally $10,000
*'''Interest Payment''': Fixed coupon or floating/variable coupon rates. Interest is paid semiannually for fixed-coupon security.
*'''How to Buy/Sell''': Through a broker
*'''Bond Interest Rate''': Determined at origination and varies by bond
*'''Price Information''': Issue price and secondary trade data available through a broker and data vendors

'''&lt;u&gt;Agency Risk Report Card&lt;/u&gt;'''
*'''Credit and default risk''' are real for GSE-issued agencies: The federal government is under no legal obligation to save a GSE from default.
*'''Call risk''': Many agency securities—step-ups in particular—carry call provisions that allow the issuer to pay you prior to the bond's maturity date, typically when interest rates drop, leaving you to reinvest at lower prevailing rates.
*'''Interest rate risk''': If interest rates rise, the value of an agency bond on the secondary market will likely fall. 

'''&lt;u&gt;Mortgage backed securities Risk Report Card&lt;/u&gt;'''
*'''Credit and default risk''' are real for MBSs issued by GSEs: The federal government is under no legal obligation to save a GSE from default.
*'''Prepayment risk''' that acts much like call risk: You get your principal back sooner than the stated maturity, but the reinvestment opportunities are limited due to the inconsistent prepayment rates, which are driven by real estate mortgage interest rates and refinancing trends; population, geographic mobility and employment opportunities; and social and economic factors that are difficult to model.
*'''Extension risk''': The opposite of prepayment risk—the risk that interest rates will go up, lengthening the estimated maturity (but not the stated maturity) of your MBS and creating more holding-period risk.
*'''Interest rate risk''': If interest rates rise, the value of a mortgage-backed security on the secondary market will likely fall.

}}

Agency and GSEs issue debt securities with different structures. These structures include:

*'''Fixed coupon''': Most agency debt issues are fixed rate, non-callable bonds. GNMA securities are (full faith and credit) [[Mortgage-backed security | mortgage pass-through securities]]. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac also issue mortgage pass through securities (not full faith and credit) in addition to bond issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://capitalmarkets.fanniemae.com/debt-securities| title=Fannie Mae Debt Securities | publisher=Fannie Mae| accessdate=October 2, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://capitalmarkets.freddiemac.com/debt| title=Debt Securities - Capital Markets| publisher=Freddie Mac| accessdate=October 2, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Variable or floating coupon rate''': These bonds have floating rates that change periodically. The interest rate is linked by formula to a treasury bond or [[wikipedia:SOFR|SOFR]] index.
*'''No coupon''': Very short term agency debt is issued at a discount and matures at par value. These securities are similar in structure to Treasury bills.
*'''Callable''': Agencies issue callable bonds with what is known as "step up" coupon rates. Callable agency bonds have a preset coupon rate "step up" option that provides for increases in interest rates or the coupon rate as the bonds approach maturity. This feature is designed to minimize the interest rate risk for investors over time. However, step up bonds are often called by issuers during periods of declining interest rates. A called bond returns an investor's principal sooner than expected and usually forces the investor to reinvest principal at a lower rate of interest.
*'''Mortgage backed securities''': Mortgage-backed securities (MBS) are pools of first mortgages on residential properties. As the underlying loans are paid off by homeowners, the investors in MBS receive payments of interest and principal over time.

==Taxation==
GNMA bonds, and all bonds from GSEs are subject to federal tax, and to state and local income tax in most states. Most other agency bonds are subject to federal income taxation but are exempt from state and local income tax.

==Role in a portfolio==
These bonds are as safe (when backed by the full faith and credit of the Government) or almost as safe (GSEs) as Treasury bonds, in terms of risk of default. However, they often have additional options embedded within them, which add risk to the purchaser. 

In particular, [[GNMA]]s have significant [[Bonds: advanced topics#Convexity |negative convexity]] resulting from the underlying mortgage holder's ability to reduce repayments when rates rise or refinance when rates fall. Since these markets are reasonably efficient, bondholders are compensated by some amount for bearing these risks. However, since risks may come into play at precisely the wrong time, some portfolio theorists advise care when designing a portfolio using mortgage backed securities. This is a controversial topic among many Bogleheads. However, most agree that choosing to include bonds with significant optionality in your portfolio is less important than choosing your overall stock/bond split in a way that reduces risk to a comfortable level. 

A reasonable summary of the controversy might be the following conclusion:
Inclusion of such bonds by purchasing Total Bond Market or a similar fund is unlikely to hugely affect portfolio performance (see the arguments of [[Taylor Larimore]] on the forum),&lt;ref&gt;{{forum link| t=70979| title=Have GNMAs hurt or helped Total Bond Market ?}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas allowing bonds with significant optionality to form a much larger portion of the bond component of your portfolio would likely be unwise. Deciding to not include any such bonds in your portfolio can also be a wise choice (see the arguments of [[Larry Swedroe]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/why-gnmas-shouldnt-be-your-bond-choice/| title=Why GNMAs Shouldn't Be Your Bond Choice| publisher=CBS News| accessdate=October 2, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{for|additional information|wikipedia:Money market}}

{{PAGENAME}} are a collection of short-term investment instruments that are highly liquid and easily converted into ready cash. Because they are short-term, money market instruments rapidly adjust to changes in short term interest rates.

Investors hold cash investments for a number of reasons, for example as an [[emergency fund]], or for payments due in the short to intermediate term. Cash includes familiar bank instruments such as transaction and savings accounts, as well as short term bank [[Certificate of deposit|certificates of deposit]] (CDs). A certificate of deposit has a fixed term, and is less liquid than a deposit account because withdrawing principal early often has a penalty.

You can buy small denomination CDs directly from banks or from a brokerage. Cash held in any bank instrument is subject to credit risk in the case of bank failure. Bank deposits are generally insured up to $250,000 by the FDIC, and most depositors sensibly stay within these limits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.fdic.gov/deposit/deposits/| title=Understanding Deposit Insurance| publisher=FDIC| date=July 30, 2020| accessdate=August 26, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; The standard insurance amount is $250,000 per depositor, per insured bank, for each account ownership category.

Cash also includes some liquid securities bought and sold on the money markets. These include [[treasury bill]]s, institutional large bank CDs, [[commercial paper]], [[banker's acceptance]]s, and repurchase agreements (repos). Tax-exempt money market funds hold short term municipal securities.

== Marketable money market instruments ==
The main money market instruments are:

* [[Treasury bill|'''Treasury Bills''']]: Obligations backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, with a maturity of less than one year. T-bills are sold in denominations of $1,000 up to a maximum purchase of $5 million and commonly have maturities of one month (four weeks), three months (13 weeks) or six months (26 weeks). They are sold at auction at a discount, and the bill matures at par, the difference being the interest earned. Interest you earn on T-bills is exempt from state income tax, giving a tax benefit. T-bills are the only institutional marketable money market instrument that you can directly purchase. You can purchase them at auction through brokerages and banks, or through an individual account at [https://www.treasurydirect.gov/marketable-securities/treasury-bills/ Treasury Direct]. Federal agencies also issue short term instruments. Some of these have the full faith and credit backing of the treasury, but others do not.
* [[Certificate of Deposit|'''Bank Certificates of Deposit''']]: Market CDs are large, often multi-million dollar CDs offered by commercial banks and sold to large institutional investors. The New York branches of foreign banks issue Yankee CDs. Eurodollar CDs are dollar denominated CDs issued by foreign banks. As well as credit risk, Yankee and Eurodollar CDs bear sovereign risk; that is, the chance that a government might confiscate or freeze assets.
* [[Commercial paper|'''Commercial Paper''']]: An unsecured, short-term debt instrument issued by a corporation, typically for financing accounts receivable, inventories, and meeting short-term liabilities. Maturities on commercial paper rarely range any longer than 270 days. Corporations usually issue the debt at a discount, reflecting prevailing market interest rates. S&amp;P and Moody's rate commercial paper. For more, see: [[wikipedia:Commercial paper|Commercial paper]] from Wikipedia.
* [[Banker's acceptance|'''Banker's Acceptances''']]: A short-term credit investment created by a non-financial firm and guaranteed by a bank, often in connection with foreign trade. They trade at a discount from face value on the secondary market, and have a long history. For more, see: [[wikipedia:Banker's acceptance|Banker's acceptance]] from Wikipedia.
* '''Repos:''' Repurchase agreements (Repos) are made when a borrower deposits a treasury bill or other security as collateral with a lender who extends an overnight loan to the borrower. The difference in repurchase price determines the interest rate of the overnight loan. For more, see: [[wikipedia:Repurchase agreement|Repurchase agreement]] from Wikipedia.
* '''Municipal Securities''': Include a variety of short term municipal issuer short term instruments. These include general market notes, commercial paper, put bonds, and [https://www.msrb.org/sites/default/files/About-Municipal-Variable-Rate-Securities.pdf variable rate demand obligations (VRDOs)]. VRDOs comprise a significant percentage of the outstanding debt in the short term municipal market. They can be structured to provide a wide range of maturity options (1 day to over 360 days) to the underlying issuing entity and are typically issued at par. Municipal securities are exempt from federal taxation, although some private revenue securities are subject to the federal [[wikipedia:Alternative Minimum Tax|Alternative Minimum Tax]].

== Money market funds ==

Money Market funds are [[mutual fund]]s that invest in money market instruments. By design, they are meant to maintain stable [[Net asset value]] (NAV) of $1.00 per share, and provide investors with interest dividends. Money funds give you convenience, diversification of risk, and competitive short term yields (although the costs of investment are a critical factor in accessing the money market through funds). The underlying investments in the portfolio characterize money market funds. This specialization allows funds to differentiate by risk and tax characteristics.

Money market funds include:

* '''General Money Funds''': These invest in a selection of money fund instruments: treasury bills, CDs, Yankee CDs, Eurodollar CDs, Commercial Paper, and Banker's Acceptances. They are usually heavily weighted towards the non-treasury instruments. Because they are exposed to credit risks, they have higher interest coupons than treasuries (you can think of this excess interest as the default risk premium). The non-treasury component of a General Money Market Fund is taxable income for both federal and state tax.
* '''Treasury Money Funds''': Treasury money funds invest 100% in "full faith and credit" treasury bills and agency instruments. As a result they are not subject to credit risk (because the treasury has monopoly power to print fiat currency.) Treasury interest is exempt from state income taxation. Government funds include treasury securities along with other government agency paper not backed by the "full faith and credit" guarantee.
* '''Tax Exempt Funds''': These invest in municipal money market instruments. The interest is generally exempt from federal taxation, although some interest may be subject to the alternative minimum tax. State-specific Tax Exempt Funds invest in municipal securities of an individual state and so generate interest for state residents that is exempt from federal tax, state tax, and sometimes local tax. Tax exempt funds are subject to credit risk, as well as the risk of tax law change to their exemption status.

=== Money fund regulation ===

Rule 2a-7&lt;ref name="Rule 2a-7"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/17/270.2a-7#| title=17 CFR § 270.2a-7 - Money market funds| publisher=Legal Information Institute| accessdate=August 26, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[wikipedia:Investment Company Act of 1940|Investment Company Act of 1940]] regulates money funds. Key regulation provisions require the following:

* '''Maturity''': Money funds can only invest in money market instruments maturing under 12 months and must maintain a weighted average maturity of 60 days or less.
* '''Diversification''': Apart from federal government securities, money funds may not invest more than 5 percent of their assets in a single issuer.
* '''Credit Quality''': Money funds must limit their investments to securities that are rated in one of the two highest short-term rating categories by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization (NRSRO). Investment in second-tier securities is limited to 3% of total fund assets, with a limit of 0.5% for any single issuer. Investment in second tier securities is restricted to maturities of 45 days or less.&lt;ref name="Rule 2a-7"/&gt;

Under the 2014 final rules,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2014/08/14/2014-17747/money-market-fund-reform-amendments-to-form-pf#h-186| title=Federal Register :: Money Market Fund Reform; Amendments to Form PF| publisher=Federal Register| date=August 14, 2014| accessdate=August 26, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; money funds are divided into three classes: institutional, retail, and government. Institutional money funds must have a floating NAV based on market values. The rules also provide for liquidity (redemption) fees and gates (suspended redemption) during periods of market distress. In summary:

* A fund may impose a fee of up to 2% on redemptions if a fund's weekly liquid assets fall below 30% of its total assets.
* A fund must impose a 1% fee on redemptions (with the option of imposing a fee of up to 2%) if its weekly liquid assets fall below 10% of its total assets, unless the fund's board determines a fee would not be in the fund's best interest.
* A fund may impose a gate (that is, suspend redemptions) for up to 10 business days in a 90-day period.
* The fees and gates rules only apply to retail and institutional funds, although government funds may voluntarily adopt them if the fees and gates are previously disclosed to investors.

=== Breaking the buck ===
{{Main|The 2008 money market crisis}}

Although money-market funds are low risk, they are not zero-risk. If some of the underlying investments default, the fund may not be able to maintain a net asset value of $1.00/share. This failure is colloquially known as ''breaking the buck''. 

Since their introduction in 1971, money market funds have ''broken the buck'' on only two occasions. Most notably, in September 2008 three money-market funds of The Reserve ''broke the buck'' after Lehman went bankrupt.

A fund files the monthly market price value ("shadow price") of money market funds, along with copious amounts of other information on fund holdings, with the SEC on form N-MFP. The table below has links to these reports for Vanguard's low-cost money market funds.

=== Default risk premium ===

Default risk premium refers to the additional return from investing in securities with a risk of default, where treasuries and other securities backed by the full faith and credit of the US government are considered to have no default risk.

If there were no default premium, then investors would have no incentive to invest in anything but treasuries. Investment costs have a direct impact on how much of the default risk premium a money market fund investor can earn. Indeed, the high costs of the average money fund totally consume the default risk premium.

As a result, investors are often exposed to 100% credit default risk without receiving any compensation over the default free treasury bill. If you hold General Money Market Funds you need to keep control of costs if you want to gain any of the default risk premium.

=== After-tax yields ===
If you are comfortable bearing default risk, you can choose a money market return using the fund's after-tax return. The calculator below (courtesy of the The Financial Buff blog) analyzes money funds, taking into account all taxable input federal, state, and alternative minimum tax.

* [https://files.thefinancebuff.com/calculators/Bond-Funds-Yield-Calculator.html Bond Fund Yield Calculator]

The fund provider can give you the percentage of a tax-exempt money fund's assets held in securities subject to the alternative minimum tax.

*The bonds should not be subject to credit risk.

A ladder of individual bonds generally includes between 10 and a couple of dozen bonds. That means that each bond represents 2.5% to 10% of a portfolio.

The argument against an investor ever owning individual [[Corporate bonds |corporate]], [[High yield bonds | high yield]], or [[Emerging market bonds | emerging market]] bonds (even in a ladder) is that the effect of a single default (such as a corporation or city brought down by fraud), even if unlikely, could be devastating to the investor's portfolio. For [[Municipal bonds | municipal bonds]] the picture is less clear, as default rates are quite low for investment grade securities;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moodys.com/cust/content/content.ashx?source=StaticContent/Free+pages/Credit+Policy+Research/documents/current/2001700000407258.pdf Moody's US Municipal Bond Rating Scale]&lt;/ref&gt; nevertheless for small-to-medium-sized portfolios, diversification requirements and high [[Bid/ask spread|bid/ask spread]] transaction costs suggest that most investors would be best served by holding municipal bonds in low cost diversified mutual funds.

*The bonds should not be [[Bond basics#Call risk |callable]].

The most frequently recommended bond instruments for bond ladders are [[Treasury Bonds |Treasury]] bonds (including [[TIPS]]).{{citation needed}} As all Treasury bonds are explicitly backed by the US government, they have the highest possible credit rating. Most Treasuries also are not subject to call risk, and if purchased at auction, have no transaction costs. FDIC-backed certificates of deposit (CDs) are also appropriate instruments for a ladder.

==Types of ladders==

===Non-rolling ladder===

A non-rolling ladder is a bond ladder in which bonds are not rolled over to new bonds at the prevailing rate.

===Rolling ladder===

In a rolling ladder, as bonds mature they are replaced with bonds of similar maturity, so that the duration of the ladder remains approximately constant. This type of ladder is essentially [[Individual Bonds vs a Bond Fund | equivalent to a bond fund]], with the added advantage that it can be converted to a non-rolling ladder at no cost by simply failing to roll over bonds as they mature.&lt;ref group ="note" name="Ally"&gt;A graphical example of a rolling ladder can be seen at [http://www.ally.com/bank/cd-ladder/#tabs=step-by-step Ally's website].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treasury bond ladders==

Treasury bond ladders have the following advantages:
# An investor saves the mutual fund fees;
# If bought at auction there are no bid-offer spreads;
#For taxable accounts there is the ability to tax loss harvest at the individual security level; treasury interest is state tax exempt;
#You can target the specific maturity and cash flow you want/need.&lt;ref&gt;[http://moneywatch.bnet.com/investing/blog/irrational-investor/bonds-or-bond-funds-an-easy-choice/873/?tag=col1;blog-river Bond or bond funds: an easy choice, comment one-Larry Swedroe]&lt;/ref&gt;

===How to establish a bond ladder===
Lets say that you have $100,000 to invest and want to set up a 5 year bond ladder. To start you would invest $20,000 in each of 5 bonds ranging from 1 to 5 years in maturity. The 5 bonds would each represent 1 “rung” in the ladder. At the end of the first year after setting up the ladder, and for each of the four years after that, one bond would mature giving you back the principal that you invested in the bond. 

If you would like to keep the ladder going, then at the end of each year, you would reinvest the principal you receive back from the bond that matures into a new 5 year bond.

===Buying treasuries at auction===
The auction dates are published in the [http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/quarterly-refunding/Documents/auctions.pdf Tentative Auction Schedule of U.S. Treasury Securities].&lt;ref&gt;The schedule of Treasury securities auctions is released at the Treasury's Quarterly Refunding press conference, usually held on the first Wednesday of February, May, August, and November.&lt;/ref&gt; A few days before the auction date, the Treasury Department also publishes a formal [http://treasurydirect.gov/instit/annceresult/press/press_secannpr.htm announcement]. The announcement includes details of the security being offered. If it's a new issue, both the price and the coupon interest rate will be determined by the auction. The coupon rate is set to nearest 0.125% below the high yield from the auction. If it's a re-opening, the coupon interest rate is already known. The auction will set the yield which in turn determines the price. 

After the announcement date but before the auction cutoff time, retail investors can place auction orders through [http://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/indiv.htm TreasuryDirect] or through a brokerage account. [http://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/indiv.htm TreasuryDirect] charges no fee but it only handles taxable accounts. If you want to buy in an IRA, you must use a brokerage account, which can also handle taxable accounts.

After the auction, the Treasury Department makes another announcement for the auction result. The settlement date is at least one day after the auction date. You must have enough cash available on the settlement date to pay for the bonds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/research/indepth/res_auctions_indepth.htm Treasury Direct: Auctions In Depth] &lt;/ref&gt;

=== Buying treasuries on the secondary market ===
You can also buy Treasuries at any time on the secondary market through a brokerage account. The prices from the brokers include a markup over what institutions pay for larger trades. Some brokers also charge a separate commission on top of the markup. TreasuryDirect does not handle secondary market purchases although you can sell your existing holdings on the secondary market through its [http://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/help/tdhelp/help_ug_263-SellDirectLearnMore.htm SellDirect] service (fees and restrictions apply).

The following link shows some current Treasury notes pricing and yields available in the secondary market.

==CD ladders==
With a normal yield curve, long-dated CDs have a higher yield than shorter-dated ones. However, long-dated CDs, by definition, lock your money into an illiquid holding. A ladder provides a way to take advantage of the highest-yielding CDs while improving liquidity of (access to) your money.

Typically, you create a ladder by splitting your money into 5 parts, and purchasing CDs of 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 year duration. When the 1 year CD matures, you use the money to purchase a new 5 year CD. After 4 years, you have all of your money invested in 5 year CDs, but 1/5th of your money is available every year. As each CD matures, you can decide whether to reinvest it in all or in part. This is a rolling ladder as defined [[#Rolling ladder | above]].&lt;ref group ="note" name="Ally" /&gt;

If you want quicker access to your money, you can also set up a 1-year ladder, with rungs at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months.

Each time a CD matures, you can purchase the highest yielding new CD you can find (known as "riding the yield curve"). In a normal yield curve, that will be the longest dated one. But in an inverted yield curve, the shortest term CD may have a higher rate. You can even [[Certificate_of_Deposit#Yield_Chasing | chase yields]] by moving your money to whatever bank is offering the best rate at that moment.

===CD ladder alternatives===
When interest rates are low, the penalties imposed for redeeming CDs early ("breaking a CD") are also low. A point may be reached where the return of a CD redeemed early is better than purchasing one for the equivalent maturity date.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=824203#824203 CD Ladder Strategy - how to handle gaps, long term rates?], forum discussion&lt;/ref&gt;

For example: A 3.49 % 7-year CD with a 12 month interest penalty is redeemed after 3 years. The return (with penalty) is 2.31%. A 3 year CD is offered at 2.00%. Breaking a 7-year CD after 3 years instead of purchasing a 3-year CD results in a higher return by 0.31%.

In this case, it may be more advantageous to purchase multiple CDs at the longest term (highest rate) and break them early. A [[:Comparing CDs#Spreadsheet overview | spreadsheet]] can be used to evaluate if ladders, multiple CDs (non-ladder), or other scenarios are best.

{{Main|United States Treasury security}}
{{for|additional information|wikipedia:United States Treasury security}}

'''Treasury bonds''' and Treasury notes are two types of marketable [[United States Treasury security |United States Treasury securities]]. The Treasury issues both [[Nominal bond|nominal bonds]], the subject of this article, and [[Treasury Inflation Protected Security|inflation-protected bonds]].&lt;ref group="note"&gt; Government agencies also issue debt, some of which is backed by the full faith and credit of the government and some of which is not&lt;/ref&gt; Treasury bonds possess the advantages inherent in treasury securities: the bonds are backed by the full faith and credit of the US government;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://treasurydirect.gov/about/| title=About| publisher=TreasuryDirect| accessdate=August 1, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt; treasury bond interest income is exempt from state and local income tax; and treasury bonds currently being issued are not [[Wikipedia:Callable bond | callable]]; although some older issues available on the secondary market are callable.

Nominal Treasury bonds are issued in two maturity ranges:
*Notes have a range between one year and ten years;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.treasurydirect.gov/marketable-securities/treasury-notes/| title=Treasury Notes| publisher=TreasuryDirect| accessdate=August 1, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Bonds have a range greater than ten years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.treasurydirect.gov/marketable-securities/treasury-bonds/| title=Treasury Bonds| publisher=TreasuryDirect| accessdate=August 1, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this article both notes and bonds are referred to as "bonds". 

==Purchasing bonds==

Treasury bonds can be purchased through brokerages and banks, as well as through an individual or entity account at [https://www.treasurydirect.gov/ TreasuryDirect]. However, TreasuryDirect cannot be used to purchase bonds intended for IRAs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://treasurydirect.gov/laws-and-regulations/department-circulars/| title=Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Department Circulars| publisher=TreasuryDirect| accessdate=August 1, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With Vanguard currently offering several broad international index funds, some investors may wonder what they should buy in their portfolios. Here is an attempt to address '''frequently asked questions''' about these funds.

== Basic questions ==

=== What broad international index funds does Vanguard have? ===

* [{{vf|0113}} Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund]
* [{{vf|0770}} Vanguard FTSE All-World ex-US Index Fund]

=== Should I buy Total International or FTSE All-World ex-US? ===

Both funds are broadly diversified international index funds, which include both developed and emerging market stocks. The Total International Index fund tracks the [[FTSE Global All Cap ex US Index|FTSE Global All Cap ex-US Index,]] providing access to large cap, mid cap, and small cap international stocks. The FTSE All-World ex-US Index fund, tracks the [[FTSE All World ex US Index|FTSE All World ex-US Index]] which covers large cap and mid cap stocks.

==== FTSE All-World ex-US ====

* Tax efficient. The fund has distributed, on average, 75% [[Qualified dividend | qualified dividends]] since inception . The fund is eligible for the [[foreign tax credit]]. It is very unlikely to distribute capital gains in the event that a country (think South Korea) moves out of emerging markets and joins developed markets.
* The investor share [[Expense ratios |expense ratio]] (0.29%) is higher than that of Total International (0.22%)
* The fund offers admiral shares with an expense ratio of 0.14%. As a general rule, expense ratios decline as fund assets increase.
* Covers large cap and mid cap stocks. Includes Canada.

==== Total International ====

* The fund has distributed, on average, 75% [[Qualified dividend | qualified dividends]] under the qualified dividend tax regime. The fund qualifies for the foreign tax credit.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The Total International fund completed transition from the fund of funds structure (which does not pass along the foreign tax credit) in 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; It is very unlikely to distribute capital gains in the event that a country moves out of emerging markets and joins developed markets. 
* The expense ratio (0.22%) is lower than that of FTSE All-World ex-US (0.29%). 
* Offers admiral shares (expense ratio 0.14%). As a general rule, expense ratios decline as fund assets increase.
* Covers large cap, mid cap and small cap stocks. Includes Canada.

=== Should I exchange FTSE All-World ex-US for Total International Admiral for the lower ER? ===

Total International's target index includes both Canada and small cap stocks, which makes the fund look more attractive to many Bogleheads. If you already hold FTSE All-World Ex-US you might be tempted to exchange it for Total International, but you should look at the costs and benefits of the exchange more closely.

If you are holding FTSE All-World Ex-US in your taxable account and have significant unrealized capital gains it is probably not worth making the conversion. The difference between an admiral share ER of 0.14% and 0.15% is a mere -$1/year per $10000 invested. 

A reasonable alternative is to hold your FTSE All-World Ex-US mutual fund and direct new money to Total International.

=== What is foreign tax credit? ===

The [[Foreign tax credit |foreign tax credit]], in our context, is a refund of tax that Vanguard pays in foreign countries on dividends. When Vanguard distributes dividends, they are already reduced by tax paid in foreign countries. With foreign tax credit, you can get that amount back, but you still have to pay Federal income tax on the dividends before the foreign tax is paid. Sorry, foreign tax credit is not free money. 

=== I am running out of tax-advantaged room. Should I put Total Stock Market or FTSE All-World ex-US in a taxable account? ===

In general, you want to put either FTSE All-World ex-US or Total International Index in a taxable account so that you can get a [[foreign tax credit]], but the difference is not that great, so your individual situation may be different. In particular, if your [[401(k)]] has better international funds than US funds, then you probably want to hold the international funds in your 401(k).

=== Should I hold FTSE All-World ex-US or Total International Index in a taxable account for a foreign tax credit even though I have not maxed out my tax-advantaged account? ===

No, you should fill your tax-advantaged accounts first. The main exception is a [[401(k)]] or [[403(b)]] with expenses so high that they negate the benefit of either tax-deferred growth or tax-free growth; you should only invest enough in such an account to get the maximum employer match. Another exception may be a non-deductible Traditional IRA. It may not be a good idea to place a tax-efficient stock index fund in a non-deductible Traditional IRA. See [[Non-deductible Traditional IRA]] for more information.

=== Wow, FTSE All-World ex-US has expense ratio of 0.29%? Should I buy VEU, the ETF share class of FTSE All-World ex-US, to save on the expenses? ===

You can gain admiral share status with the fund for an investment of $10,000. If you take the ETF route, keep in mind that you will likely have to pay a commission on the purchase and sale if you do not purchase directly from Vanguard. In general, ETF shares may be a good choice if:

* you already have a brokerage account which has low commissions (no more than $10 or so),
* you are planning to invest in large lump sum(s), rather than small monthly contributions (which would incur a commission at every purchase),
* your brokerage allows for (free) reinvestment of fund distributions, and
* you can resist the temptation to trade the ETFs too often.

For a general discussion of whether to go ETF, see [http://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=10522 To ETF or Not to ETF].

You may also want to use a calculator at [https://personal.vanguard.com/us/faces/JSP/Funds/Tools/FundsToolsEtfCostSelectionContent.jsp?etfId=0 Calculate and compare costs for Vanguard ETFs and mutual funds] to see if going with the ETF makes sense for you.

=== I heard that slicing and dicing boosts return. Why go broad? ===
{{Main|Slice and dice international}}

=== The FTSE All-World ex-US lacks small-cap stocks. What should I buy to fill that area? ===
{{Main|Vanguard FTSE All-World ex-US Small-Cap Index Fund}}
The Vanguard Total International Index includes the market weighting of international small cap stocks.

Vanguard now has the [{{vf|1684}} Vanguard FTSE All-World ex-US Small-Cap Index Fund]. If you use this fund, it is more natural to use FTSE All-World ex-US for your large-cap allocation, as the two funds track exactly complementary indexes.

=== I would like some value tilt. What options does Vanguard provide? ===

For a [[Value tilting - stock|value tilt]] you might consider [{{vf|0046}} Vanguard International Value Fund]. If you are interested in growth tilt, consider [{{vf|0081}} Vanguard International Growth Fund]. Both of these are actively managed funds and thus often distribute capital gains. You should consider placing them in a tax-advantaged account.

=== How are the international funds priced when there is always a market open and trading somewhere in the world? ===

Share price, also known as [[Net asset value | ''net asset value'']] (NAV), is calculated each business day as of the close of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange, generally 4 p.m., Eastern Time. This is true for both domestic and international funds.

Stocks held by a Vanguard fund are valued at their ''market value'' when reliable market quotations are readily available. The values of any foreign securities held by a fund are converted into U.S. dollars using an exchange rate obtained from an independent third party.

When reliable market quotations are not readily available, securities are priced at their [[Fair value pricing | ''fair-value'' ]](the amount that the owner might reasonably expect to receive upon the sale of a security). A fund will also use fair-value pricing if the value of a security it holds has been materially affected by events occurring before the fund's pricing time but after the close of the primary markets or exchanges on which the security is traded. This most commonly occurs with foreign securities, which may trade on foreign exchanges that close many hours before the fund's pricing time. Intervening events might be company-specific (e.g. earnings report, merger announcement); country-specific (e.g. natural disaster, economic or political news, act of terrorism, interest rate change); or global. Intervening events include price movements in U.S. markets that are deemed to affect the value of foreign securities.

Fair-value prices are determined according to procedures adopted by a fund's board of trustees. When fair-value pricing is employed, the prices of securities used by a fund to calculate the NAV may differ from quoted or published prices for the same securities.

'''{{PAGENAME}}s''' were created from a law that Congress enacted in 1960&lt;ref group="note"&gt; Additional major legislative changes to REITs since 1960 include the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (TRA), which eliminated the tax benefits of real estate limited partnerships and launched the modern era of equity REITS; the IRS private letter ruling on the Taubman Centers Inc. initial public offering (IPO) in 1992, which allowed for the tax free exchange of partnership real property to a REIT (known as an UPREIT); the Omnibus Budget and Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA), and the REIT Modernization Act of 1999 (RMA). See Feng, Zhilan, Price, S. McKay and Sirmans, C. F., ''An Overview of Equity Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs): 1993-2009'' (March 8, 2011). Journal of Real Estate Literature, Vol. 19, No. 2, pp. 307-343, 2011. Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=1743132&lt;/ref&gt; to enable small investors to invest in real estate without either the large capital required to purchase single properties, or the responsibilities of property maintenance on a direct realty purchase. When holding shares of an equity REIT, an investor is an actual owner of the underlying real estate. 

REITs receive special tax treatment--the deduction of dividend payments on their corporate income taxes-- as long as the primary purpose of the company is to own real estate and it pays out 90% of its dividend income (rental income or mortgage interest) each year to shareholders. The special tax treatment REIT dividends receive means that they are deemed non-qualified dividends for the investor (that is, not subject to the lower "qualified" dividend tax rate granted to firms subject to double taxation). This makes REITs very tax-inefficient, and best held in tax-advantaged accounts.&lt;ref group= "note"&gt; Since 1972, the inception of the NAREIT Equity Index, the composition of equity REITs total return has consisted of 60% income return and 40% capital gain return. See also, [http://www.reit.com/REIT101/REITAttributes/Dividends.aspx Income history], Reit.com &lt;/ref&gt; 

If an investor has filled up available tax-advantaged space with bonds and wants to invest in REITs, placing them in a low-cost [[Variable Annuity |variable annuity]] or a [[Non-deductible traditional IRA|non-deductible traditional IRA]] is usually more tax efficient than holding them in a taxable account. Alternately, an investor can also switch taxable bonds held in tax-advantaged accounts for REIT held in tax-advantaged and adding [[Municipal bonds | municipal bonds]] held in taxable accounts.

==Types of REITs==
REITs are typically characterized by the nature of the assets the company holds: real estate, mortgages, or a combination of the two. 
* '''Equity REITs''': own physical real estate and are traded on a public stock exchange. This makes REITs very liquid unlike owning real estate directly. Equity REITS make up over 80% of the U.S. REIT market,&lt;ref&gt; Feng, Zhilan, Price, S. McKay and Sirmans, C. F., ''An Overview of Equity Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs): 1993-2009'' (March 8, 2011). Journal of Real Estate Literature, Vol. 19, No. 2, pp. 307-343, 2011. Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=1743132&lt;/ref&gt; and include the following sectors:
:* Diversified REITs: own a diverse group of properties not tied to any specific sector or industry.
:* Industrial REITs: own industrial real estate, that is, used for industry manufacturing.
:* Office REITs: REITs that own office buildings or other similar property.
:* Residential REITs: REITs that invest in residential real estate, such as apartment complexes.
:* Retail REITs: REITs that invest primarily in retail properties such as shopping malls.
:* Specialized REITs: own property that is specialized in a single use (such as lodging or storage).
* '''Mortgage REITs''': Invest primarily in mortgages backed by commercial real estate, and the earnings are from the mortgage loans.&lt;ref group="note"&gt; [{{Vf | 0123}} Vanguard REIT Index Fund] does not invest in mortgage REITs since they are not part of the MSCI REIT index. &lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Hybrid REITs''': REITs that invest in both property ownership and mortgages.
* '''Private REITs''': Private (non-traded) REITs are not traded on a public stock exchange, and are very illiquid. These are often sold by financial advisors who receive large commissions, an indication that they are not looking out for your best interest, and are designed to be sold and not bought.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reitwrecks.com/2009/05/non-traded-reits-are-designed-to-be.html Non-Traded REITs Are Designed to be Sold, Not Bought], REIT Wrecks&lt;/ref&gt;

==Valuation of REITs==
REITs are typically valued using two factors: yield, and premium (discount) to [[Net asset value | NAV]].

===Dividend yield===
A REIT's yield&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The income return on an investment. This refers to the interest or dividends received from a security and is usually expressed annually as a percentage. See: [http://www.investopedia.com/terms/y/yield.asp Yield Definition on Investopedia]&lt;/ref&gt; is calculated exactly as stocks and is expressed as an amount of dividends (in percent) a REIT will pay investors.

:&lt;math&gt;\mbox{Dividend yield}=\frac{\mbox{dividend per share}}{\mbox{price per share}}&lt;/math&gt;

Unlike a bond's [[Bond yield#Yield to maturity | Yield-to-Maturity]] (YTM), there is no presumption that capital, i.e. NAV, will be returned to investors in that equation (the redemption of a bond).

With common stocks, company boards decide how much of ''Earnings Per Share'' are to be paid out as ''Dividends Per Share''. This can cover a large range, as many pay no dividends at all, but ''Dividends Per Share'' may typically range from 1.5 to 3 times ''Earnings Per Share''.

With REITs, Earnings Per Share are ''not'' an accurate measure of a REIT's performance. Investment analysts usually use an adjustment to earnings known as ''Funds From Operations (FFO)''&lt;ref group="note"&gt; ''Funds From Operations'' adjusts earnings by adding back such significant non-cash elements on the balance sheet as real estate depreciation and other amortization, and subtracting capital gains or adding capital losses from sales of real estate. See [http://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fundsfromoperation.asp Funds From Operations - FFO], investopedia. A further adjustment, known as ''Adjusted Funds From Operations (AFFO)'' is often made to FFO. The most common adjustments are for regular expenditures used to maintain or improve a REIT's properties. See [http://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/affo.asp Adjusted Funds From Operations (AFFO)], Investopedia. Over the 1993 - 2009 period, U.S equity REITs provided an average 10.00% Funds From Operations yield, compared to 4.16% Earnings Per Share yield. Over the same period, equity REITS provided an average dividend payout ratio (Dividends/Net Income) of 131.48%. See See Feng, Zhilan, Price, S. McKay and Sirmans, C. F., ''An Overview of Equity Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs): 1993-2009'' (March 8, 2011). Journal of Real Estate Literature, Vol. 19, No. 2, pp. 307-343, 2011. Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=1743132. &lt;br&gt; In terms of dividend yield, Vanguard research reports that the FTSE NAREIT index provided an average 6.70% dividend yield over the 1989 - 2008 period, which is consistent with the 1993 - 2009 index return (6.70% average yield) derived from index data available for download at [http://www.reit.com/DataAndResearch/IndexData/FNUS-Historical-Data.aspx NAREIT]. See [https://institutional.vanguard.com/iam/pdf/ICRREI.pdf?cbdForceDomain=false Commercial Equity Real Estate: A Framework for Analysis] by Christopher B. Philips, CFA, Vanguard Investment Counseling &amp; Research, 08/17/2007. &lt;/ref&gt; as a more accurate measure of an equity REIT's profitability and capacity to pay dividends.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.investopedia.com/articles/04/112204.asp How To Assess A Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT)], investopedia. &lt;/ref&gt; 

US tax laws require essentially a payout of 90% of GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principle) taxable income, so "adjusted" ''Earnings Per Share'' and ''Dividends Per Share'' are closely aligned. Therefore, it is appropriate to value the REIT on a dividend yield basis.

For example: A REIT has a share price of $100. The total dividend for the REIT is expected to be $3.00 over the next 12 months. The REIT is therefore said to be trading at a prospective dividend yield of 3/100 or 3%.

===Average premium (discount) to NAV===
A REIT's Net Asset Value is calculated as:

:&lt;math&gt;\mbox{NAV per share}=\frac{\mbox{gross value of buildings}-\mbox{debt}}{\mbox{number of shares}}&lt;/math&gt;

Debt is taken deducting any cash that is on the REIT balance sheet.&lt;ref group="note"&gt; Over the 1993 - 2009 period, the leverage ratio (long-term liabilities divided by total assets) for U.S equity REITS averaged 44.37%. The annual average leverage ratio has ranged from a low of 29.96% in 1993 to a high of 51.31% in 2008, and has generally risen over the measurement period. See See Feng, Zhilan, Price, S. McKay and Sirmans, C. F., ''An Overview of Equity Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs): 1993-2009'' (March 8, 2011). Journal of Real Estate Literature, Vol. 19, No. 2, pp. 307-343, 2011. Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=1743132 &lt;/ref&gt;

The quoted price of a REIT, which trades like any stock, can differ from NAV. Historically, when the market is bullish about future commercial real estate values, stocks move to a premium to NAV. This is also true if there is a lot of takeover activity in the REIT sector. In essence, investors are expecting NAVs to rise. The discounts are quite analogous to [[Closed End Funds|closed end funds]], which normally trade at a discount to the value of their underlying investments.

Green Street Advisers publishes graphs showing estimated average premium (discount) to NAV.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;[http://www.greenstreetadvisors.com/ Green Street Advisers]. This link does not represent an endorsement, but this approach seems like a useful way to think about REIT valuation.

Average Premium to NAV: The premium (discount) ascribed to a company’s net asset value that is implied by the current share price compared to Green Street’s assessment of net asset value. Observed premiums/discounts in the public market have historically been reliable predictors of future changes in private-market prices.&lt;/ref&gt; The premium (discount) to NAV has ranged from over 30% premium to 40% discount over time.

===Expected returns from REITs===

[[William Bernstein]] has proposed a simple model for estimating long term returns for equity REITS. The sources of return for a REIT are:

* The current dividend yield,&lt;ref group="note"&gt; The dividend yield, is based on the payout of Funds from Operation minus the costs of maintaining property. Ruff in his paper "Commercial Real Estate: New Paradigm or Old Story, applies this metric to direct investment in real property, where it is referred to as the Cap rate, which is the net cap rate minus the expense cap rate, which is assumed to average 2%. &lt;/ref&gt; ( in our example above $3.00 per share).
* Any future growth in dividends. William Bernstein has shown that these grow by less than GDP.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.efficientfrontier.com/ef/702/2percent.htm The Two-Percent Dilution], ''Efficient Frontier'', 2002. &lt;/ref&gt; For REITS, rental income growth is usually assumed to roughly equal the inflation rate.
* The change in valuation of the REITs, or ‘speculative return’.

As an example, if REITs are currently yielding 3% and we expect future dividend growth of 3% per annum (i.e. slightly ahead of inflation), then expected long term returns are = 3% + 3% + change in valuation.

====Speculative return====
The following example illustrates the role of speculative return in the valuation model.

In our example above, the REIT has a share price of $100 and pays $3.00 dividends per annum. Our assumed yield on REITs (c. 3%) is very low compared to historic ranges. A pessimist might argue REITs will eventually return to say a 6% yield, implying a halving of valuation. If this revaluation took place over 18 years, the expected return of REITs in the formula above = 3% + 3% - 4% = 2% per annum. 

In other words, in 18 years, our REIT would have dividends of $5.11 (x 1.03^18), a price of $85.12 (5.11/ 6% yield), but the investor would also have received the dividends paid out in that time period, giving a positive total return despite the fall in valuation.

Note that in this model, because a yield is a per cent rather than a times (‘x’) like PE, a ''rise'' in yields is a fall in valuation, while a ''fall'' in yields is a rise in valuation.

The most important thing to observe both about premium/ discount to NAV and yield, for REITs, is that it is anything but stable. Even the long term average may not be that helpful, because real estate tends to have long cycles and the reversion to mean from a high or low takes so long.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;"Commercial Real Estate (CRE) tends to have a long cycle, typically over 10 years, and the booms and busts are spectacular. The CRE bust in New England in the early 1990s brought down at least one bank ([[Wikipedia:Bank of New England|Bank of New England, wikipedia]]) and left empty office buildings dotting the area for years. Something similar happened in Toronto at the same time. In London, the bankruptcy of the Canadian developer [[Wikipedia:Olympia and York|Olympia and York, wikipedia]], the owner of the Canary Wharf supercomplex, left Barclays Bank in possession of 10 per cent. of the UK’s entire office space Similar patterns were seen in western US states during the S&amp;L Crisis of the early 1990s. Before that, Calgary and Houston were particularly badly hit in the early 1980s when oil prices fell. There were office buildings built in Calgary in 1980 that were still empty in 1992." from ''Valuation of REITS'', unpublished document, by forum member Valuethinker.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dividend composition==
REIT dividends are composed of three different types of yield income, which are taxed at different rates:
* '''Return of Capital''': This is a return of your own investment and is not taxed upon distribution, it reduces your cost basis by the amount of the dividend.
* '''Capital Gain''': Results from sale of properties or other assets, taxed at either short or long term capital gains rates.
* '''Dividend''': Income which usually results from rental income of properties, which is non-qualified and taxed at your full marginal tax rate.&lt;ref&gt; See [{{Vf | 0123}} Current REIT index fund yield estimate], for the current yield of the Vanguard REIT index fund. &lt;/ref&gt;

The exact breakdown of the REIT fund dividends are not known until after the calendar year, sometimes as late as late February or early March. Beware of this if you hold REIT in a taxable account.&lt;ref group="note"&gt; For example, Vanguard provides a current estimate of unadjusted yield, and adjusted yield accounting for the return of capital on their [{{Vf | 0123}} Current REIT index fund yield estimate] page. They do not quote a 30-day SEC yield for the fund due to these complications. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Risks==

===Interest rate risk===
REIT prices may decline as the interest rate rises.

===Sector risk===
Equity REITs are one specific sector of the stock market; as of 2016, there are 151 stocks in the MSCI REIT index.&lt;ref&gt; [{{Vf | 0123}} Vanguard REIT Index Fund - Portfolio]&lt;/ref&gt; This makes REITs more volatile than broad market index funds. Some suggest that public REITs represent only a small slice of the commercial real estate market, and are best referred to as a separate asset class rather than a sector.&lt;ref group="note"&gt; Whether equity REITS act as a suitable proxy for direct investment in commercial real estate is an unsettled question in academic finance. Among recent papers, Hoesli, Martin and Oikarinen, Elias, ''Are REITs Real Estate? Evidence from International Sector Level Data'' (March 1, 2012). Swiss Finance Institute Research Paper No. 12-15. Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=2034377 or http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2034377, concludes: &lt;br&gt; "Both the variance decompositions and impulse responses suggest that the long-run REIT market performance is much more closely related to the direct real estate market than to the general stock market. Consequently, REITs and direct real estate should be relatively good substitutes in a long-horizon investment portfolio." &lt;br&gt;On the other hand, Pavlov, Andrey D. and Wachter, Susan M.,'' REITS and Underlying Real Estate Markets: Is There a Link?'' (June 27, 2011). U of Penn, Inst for Law &amp; Econ Research Paper No. 11-20. Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=1879968 or http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.1879968 finds: &lt;br&gt; "a statistically significant relationship between REIT and real estate returns only in the office sector. Other property types offer only very weak and insignificant relationships. This finding suggests that direct real estate investment or investment through the property price index derivatives cannot be replicated using REITs." &lt;/ref&gt;

==Returns==
The NAREIT Equity Index provides the longest term history of U.S equity REITs, covering the period from 1972 to the present. Over this period, equity REIT's annual return ranged between a high of +47.59% in 1976 and a low of -37.73% in 2008.

The 1973 - 1974 bear market in REIT stocks was predominantly marked by the negative performance of mortgage REITs which made up the majority of REIT issues during this era. These mortgage REITs had a large number of holdings in real estate building and development loans, many of which defaulted in the recessionary economic environment.&lt;ref&gt; [https://www.aier.org/sites/default/files/publications/RR19740902.pdf Research Reports: Real Estate Investment Trusts], American Institute for Economic Research, November 2, 1974. &lt;/ref&gt; The NAREIT Mortgage REIT indexed declined -36.26% in 1973, and dropped -45.32% in 1974.

After the 1973 - 1974 bear market equity REITs remained a small portion of the overall equity market. In 1975 the market consisted of 12 equity REITs with a market capitalization of 275.7 million dollars. Tax changes in 1987 and 1992 set the stage for a steady increase in both the number of equity REITs and the market capitalization of the REIT market.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.reit.com/DataAndResearch/US-REIT-Industry-MarketCap.aspx Historical REIT Industry Market Capitalization:], REIT.com &lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, with the maturation of the equity REIT market, Vanguard introduced an equity REIT index fund, tracking the MSCI US REIT Index. 

Most equity REIT market declines have historically preceded or been coincident with economic recessions. The NAREIT Index declined in the 1989 - 1990 recession;&lt;ref&gt; [[Wikipedia:Early 1990s recession in the United States|Early 1990s recession in the United States]] &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.fdic.gov/bank/historical/s&amp;l/ The S&amp;L Crisis: A Chrono-Bibliography],FDIC &lt;/ref&gt; declined again in the 1998 - 1999 bear market&lt;ref&gt; Clayton, Jim F. and MacKinnon, Greg H., Explaining the Discount to NAV in REIT Pricing: Noise or Information?

Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=258268 or http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.258268 &lt;/ref&gt; in advance of the 2000 - 2002 overall U.S. market decline (during which equity REITs provided positive returns); and declined once again in 2007 - 2008, the beginning stages of the 2008 - 2009 recession.&lt;ref&gt; [[Wikipedia:Great Recession in the United States|Great Recession in the United States]] &lt;/ref&gt;

==Role in a portfolio==
[[File:Reit correlation.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Source:[http://www.reit.com/InstitutionalInvestors/Diversification.aspx REIT.com]]]
Most Bogleheads allocate REITs up to 10% of their total portfolio according to a [http://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=219&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;vote=viewresult forum poll]. David Swensen, CIO of Yale University and author of [[Special:BookSources/978-0-7432-2838-1|''Unconventional Success'']] suggests a 20% allocation to equity REITs in his [[Lazy Portfolios#David Swensen's lazy portfolio |model portfolio]] for individual investors.

REITs, due to the risks involved, should be treated as equity even though they have income-producing characteristics similar to bonds. 

REITs can act as a portfolio diversifier since they have varying correlation to stocks and bonds (either higher or lower).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.portfoliosolutions.com/assets/attachments/2006_3_c.pdf By the Numbers: Asset Correlations, Fall 2006, Portfolio Solutions] &lt;/ref&gt; REITs are weakly correlated to inflation, due to the hard asset/rental income nature of the investment,&lt;ref&gt; [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=927712 Cointegration of Real Estate Stocks and REITs with Common Stocks, Bonds and Consumer Price Inflation - An International Comparison] by Westerheide, Peter (2006) &lt;/ref&gt; however investors looking specifically for inflation protection can instead use individual [[TIPS]], held to maturity, 

If you are using a portfolio of Vanguard market based or style based index funds, you should consider what percentages of REITs are present in Vanguard index funds before adding a separate REIT fund.

==Funds==
Indexed portfolios of equity REITs are available as both [[Mutual fund|mutual funds]] and [[Exchange-traded funds|exchange traded funds]]. [[Fidelity]] and [[The Vanguard Group |Vanguard]] offer low cost REIT index mutual funds. [[BlackRock iShares|iShares]], [[Charles Schwab|Schwab]], Guggenheim, State Street Global Advisors, and Vanguard offer equity REIT exchange traded funds.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is careful design of a portfolio that meets your [[Asset allocation |asset allocation]] when considering all the accounts in the portfolio as a whole.&lt;ref group="note"&gt; The ideas outlined in this article are designed for long term saving and investing, typically for your retirement. Shorter term goals, such as paying for a specific large purchase in the near to intermediate term, or investing to fund your children's future education, may mean that you have to design a separate asset allocation plan for a specific type of account, such as a taxable account, or educational savings account. &lt;/ref&gt; This article uses '''asset location''' and '''asset placement''' interchangeably.

If you want to create a portfolio based on the [[Bogleheads® investment philosophy]], developing it can become complicated when you have to consider more than one account.

If you have only a single retirement account, and that account contains all the funds you need, either in separate funds or in an all-in-one fund (like a [[Target Retirement| target retirement]], [[LifeStrategy]] or [[Balanced fund|balanced]] fund), it is straightforward to select your fund(s) today and keep them balanced in the future.

Many investors, however, have a collection of accounts: [[401(k)]] or [[403(b)|403(b)]], [[457(b)|457]], [[Traditional IRA|traditional IRA]], [[Roth IRA]], taxable accounts, and so on. They may be contributing to some of these, while others might be closed for new contributions. For couples, the number of accounts in a consolidated portfolio can double. Developing a coherent portfolio across all of these accounts that covers the asset allocation you want becomes even more complex.

With IRAs, you generally have your choice of funds. However, you can face problems if one or more of the accounts is a 401k or other employer-sponsored plans with a limited number of low-expense [[Indexing|index funds]], or none at all. Things also become complicated when you hold investments in your taxable accounts that might not be ideal for Boglehead investing principles, or which might be complicated to plan around, but which you are reluctant to sell because of tax implications.

This article provides '''initial guidance''' on how you can design a coherent portfolio across multiple accounts, while combining many of the investment principles covered in greater detail in other articles. However, while this article does cover basic principles, there are many variables that will make your profile unique. Use the information in this article as a framework for thinking about your portfolio design. There are many grey areas, and the information below will not necessarily be enough to build the "perfect" portfolio for your own unique circumstances. Please consider [[asking portfolio questions]] on the forum to get input from forum members. 

For a more concise explanation of these principles, with practical examples, see [[How to build a lazy portfolio]].

== Principles of asset allocation across multiple accounts ==
Assuming you are already [[Prioritizing investments|prioritizing investments]], then when you choose funds across accounts, follow these principles, listed in ''general'' order of priority:
# Choose the best and most appropriate fund choices for each asset category across your entire portfolio to achieve your target asset allocation
# Follow [[principles of tax-efficient fund placement]]
# Minimize the blended [[expense ratio]] across entire portfolio
# Provide ability to maintain asset allocation as ongoing contributions accumulate, without needing frequent rebalancing or exchanges (see [[#Rebalancing considerations |Rebalancing considerations]] below for details)
# Minimize complexity by avoiding an excessive number of "slices."
The order of priority is not absolute. In many portfolios, you have to balance two or more conflicting principles in concert, as described in more detail in the [[#Conflicting principles | Conflicting principles]] section of this article, which may cause you to elevate one priority over another in certain edge cases.

Consider the first three principles as core principles. The fourth and fifth principles are "nice to haves" but generally come after the core principles.

== Illustration of a multi-account portfolio ==
This section illustrates graphically some basic concepts of what a multi-account portfolio looks like using a sample portfolio with a sample asset allocation target as a case study.

=== Sample asset allocation ===
[[Image:MultiAccountPortfolioChart1.png|right|200px|thumb|'''Chart 1''' - Portfolio with asset classes]]
Chart 1 shows a sample portfolio of $100,000 with an asset allocation of 70% stocks and 30% bonds. This asset allocation will be used in the next three sample portfolios. The allocation is further divided into the following three [[asset class]]es:
* 50% US [[Stock basics|stocks]]
* 30% [[Bond basics|bonds]]
* 20% [[Domestic/International|international]] stocks
In this chart and later charts, these asset classes are color-coded in the following way:
* US Stocks in &lt;font color="red"&gt;red&lt;/font&gt;
* Bonds in &lt;font color="blue"&gt;blue&lt;/font&gt;
* International stocks in &lt;font color="green"&gt;green&lt;/font&gt;
In all charts, the relative vertical sizes of the bars in all the charts are the same to help make visual comparisons between the charts equivalent.

=== Portfolio 1 - Complex portfolio ===
Chart 2 shows an example of a complex portfolio for a married couple that implements the asset allocation described above.
[[Image:MultiAccountPortfolioChart4.png|left|400px|thumb|'''Chart 2''' - Complex multi-account portfolio for a couple]]&lt;div style="clear:both; margin:0; padding:0;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
This portfolio contains six different retirement accounts, for two people, with a total of eight splits spread across five different funds in the six accounts. Each account has a different balance, but the allocations are split up in such a way that the desired overall asset allocation is achieved when all the accounts are summed, which will be illustrated below in Chart 2A.

Observe that two of the funds ('''S&amp;P 500''' in Her 403b and '''Extended Market''' in Her Roth IRA) are sub-classes of the overall US stock asset class; this kind of sub-division might be necessary if Her 403b has only a [[S&amp;P 500 Index|S&amp;P 500 index fund]] and no total stock market fund.  
&lt;div style="clear:both; margin:0; padding:0;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Each '''account''' has a different balance, but the allocations are split up in such a way that the desired overall asset allocation is achieved when all the accounts are summed. This is shown below in Chart 2A. On the left side is the amounts held in the three '''asset classes''', divided up by '''account'''. The right side repeats Chart 1, which is the desired amounts to hold in each asset class. As you can see, the complex portfolio, when looked at as a unified whole, sums up to the target amounts in each of the three asset classes: Bonds are $30,000, US Stocks are $50,000 and International Stocks are $20,000.
[[Image:MultiAccountPortfolioPortfolio1_comparison.png|left|thumb|768px|'''Chart 2A''': Portfolio 1 viewed from the perspective of holdings in each '''asset class''', and further subdivided by '''account'''.]]
&lt;div style="clear:both; margin:0; padding:0;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Although Portfolio 1 looks complex, it is not uncommon for people who have been investing for a few years to arrive at a portfolio like this. The next sections look at a simpler portfolio and compare and contrast two approaches to portfolio design.

=== Portfolio 2 - Mirrored asset allocation ===
Chart 3 shows a different portfolio with the same asset allocation in the original example, distributed across three different retirement accounts, each of which has a different balance. The asset allocation in each account mirrors the overall asset allocation by having one fund for each asset class in each account.
[[Image:MultiAccountPortfolioChart2.png|left|500px|thumb|'''Chart 3''' - Portfolio with asset allocation mirrored across three accounts]]
&lt;div style="clear:both; margin:0; padding:0;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
The name of each account is on the bottom legend, and each account is separated by a vertical line.

Portfolio 2 will be contrasted with Portfolio 3 below.

=== Portfolio 3 - Spread asset allocation ===
Chart 4 shows the sample multi-account portfolio as in Portfolio 2, only with the assets consolidated across three accounts in five total splits. Observe that the total amounts within each asset class (US stocks, bonds and international stocks) are the same.

As well, the overall balance of each of the three accounts is the same. The only difference between Portfolio 2 and 3 is that the latter has fewer slices, and the locations of the asset classes are different. As described in more detail below, although the two portfolios seem to be almost identical variations of each other, Portfolio 3 is the optimal one. 
[[Image:MultiAccountPortfolioChart3.png|left|300px|thumb|'''Chart 4''' - Portfolio with asset allocation spread across three accounts]]&lt;div style="clear:both; margin:0; padding:0;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

== Mirror asset allocation in each account or across portfolio ==
[[#Portfolio 2 - Mirrored asset allocation|Portfolio 2]] above illustrates a portfolio in which each account has the same desired asset allocation. [[#Portfolio 3 - Spread asset allocation|Portfolio 3]], by contrast, does not aim to mirror the desired asset allocation in ''each account'', but does succeed in creating the desired asset allocation across the '''entire portfolio'''.

Chart 5 shows both portfolios, summed by account.
[[Image:MultiAccountPortfolioChart5.png|left|768px|thumb|'''Chart 5''' - Comparison of [[#Portfolio 2 - Mirrored asset allocation|Portfolio 2]] and [[#Portfolio 3 - Spread asset allocation|Portfolio 3]] summed by account. In both portfolios, the balances in each account are identical, and the sums of the holdings in each asset class are identical.]]&lt;div style="clear:both; margin:0; padding:0;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
As you can observe in Chart 5 above, the '''account balance''' of each account is identical, but Portfolio 2 has more slices (9) compared to Portfolio 3 (which has 5 slices).

Chart 5a below shows Portfolio 2 and Portfolio 3 side by side, but instead of summing by '''account balance''', we sum by '''asset class'''. Chart 5a illustrates that the '''amount''' in each asset class is identical for both portfolios. Also shown on the far right are the '''targets''' for each asset class (Chart 1) for comparison. As you can see, both Portfolios 2 and 3 sum up to $30,000 in bonds, $50,000 in US Stocks, and $20,000 in international stocks. The only difference is that Portfolio 2 does this with 9 slices whereas Portfolio 3 achieves the same results with 5 slices.
[[Image:MultiAccountPortfolioChart5a.png|left|thumb|768px|'''Chart 5A''' - Comparison of [[#Portfolio 2 - Mirrored asset allocation|Portfolio 2]] and [[#Portfolio 3 - Spread asset allocation|Portfolio 3]] summed by asset class.]]&lt;div style="clear:both; margin:0; padding:0;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
=== Advantages of whole portfolio allocation ===
In many cases, the latter approach of consolidating asset classes into a smaller number of fund slices across a total portfolio, as shown in Portfolio 3, has many advantages:&lt;ref&gt;{{forum link| p=1412990| title=Asset Allocation across multiple investing buckets?| date=June 9, 2012| author=retiredjg}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

* This allows you to choose the best and the lowest cost funds from each account. 
* It allows you to invest [[Principles of tax-efficient fund placement|tax-efficiently]].
* It eliminates tiny slices, especially for narrow asset classes (like [[REIT]]s)
* It eliminates having to meet a minimum amount for each fund multiple times.
* It gets you to cheaper share classes faster (such as Vanguard admiral shares).
* It eliminates unnecessary duplication.
* It makes [[Rebalancing|rebalancing]] simpler.

The possible defects of Portfolio 2 (the 9-slice portfolio) compared to Portfolio 3 (the 5-slice portfolio) are:
* You might be using more expensive funds in the 401k plan when you could concentrate all your holdings in the least expensive fund. As a result, your '''blended expense ratio''' across your entire portfolio will be higher than it needs to be.
* In the 401k, you may have selected '''inferior funds''' in every one of your target asset class, just for the sake of having a fund in every asset class in the 401k account.
* You may fail to meet the '''fund minimums''' for the smallest slices in the smallest account (in this case the bond slice in the Roth IRA may fall below the fund minimum).
* By slicing into too many small accounts, you might fail to meet the minimum for '''cheaper share classes''' such as Vanguard Admiral shares.
* By putting bonds in taxable, your portfolio is '''less tax-efficient''' than it could be if you concentrated bond holdings in tax-advantaged accounts.
* You have created a more complicated portfolio that can be more difficult to maintain.

Said more simply, the differences between Portfolio 2 and 3 are:
* "Portfolio 2 (mirrored allocation in every account) is like going to three grocery stores and buying 4 eggs at each, 1/3 pound of hamburger meat, and two cans of Coke.
* "Portfolio 3 (intelligent consolidation of asset classes across entire portfolio) is buying a 6 pack of Coke at the store where it is on sale, a dozen eggs at the store where it is on sale, and a pound of hamburger meat where it is the best price (or quality)."&lt;ref&gt;{{forum link| p=1387085| title=Advice on My Investments? (Thoughtfully Prepared)| date=May 9, 2012| author=Dickenjb}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Advantages of mirroring asset allocation in each account ===
Although a diligent investor who monitors their portfolio can often exact some gains (such as tax efficiency or lower expense ratios) from a whole portfolio approach to asset allocation, in some cases there can be some advantages to mirroring asset allocation in each account.

==== Rebalancing simplicity ====
If each account has the same allocation, it can be simpler to [[rebalancing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{forum link| p=1416936| title=Need Help with Initial Asset Allocation - Please| author=[[Rick Ferri]]| date=June 14, 2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Simplicity of all-in-one funds ====
Because investors are prone to making the mistake of viewing their portfolios by accounts rather than as a whole, they might be better off holding "balanced" allocations across accounts, even at the cost of a slight increase in a blended expense ratio or a slight loss in tax-efficiency.

Put another way, a casual investor might be better off holding the identical Target Date, Balanced or LifeStrategy funds in every account, rather than divide into single-class funds. They offset any minor sacrifice in expenses or tax-efficiency by holding the right asset classes and avoiding damaging mistakes.

== Steps to designing portfolio ==
[[Image:MultiAccountPortfolioBuckets.png|right|thumb|200px|'''Figure 1''' - Illustration of the '''bucket''' and '''pitcher''' analogy for asset allocation across multiple accounts. The buckets (asset classes) are on the bottom and the pitchers (accounts) are on the top. Each shape is sized proportionally per the target allocations and account balances of the sample Portfolio 3 used elsewhere in this article as a case study.]]
While it may seem difficult at first to compose a portfolio across multiple accounts, there are some general steps you can follow. If you are uncertain you can always submit your plan for feedback, or ask for general advice, in the [http://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewforum.php?f=1 Help with Personal Investments] forum. Also, see [[How to build a lazy portfolio]] for a streamlined explanation of what follows.

To visualize this exercise, imagine you have some '''buckets''' and some '''pitchers''' of fluid, which you can see in Figure 1. Each bucket is an '''asset class''', and the size of each bucket is based on how much you want to hold in that asset class. The pitchers of fluid represent each '''account''' you have, and the volume of fluid in each pitcher is based on your '''account balance'''. For the purposes of this exercise, suppose that the fluid is a different color for each account and it does not dissolve into other fluids.

In designing a multi-account portfolio, you are trying to strategically pour the fluid (money) from each pitcher (account) into each bucket (asset class) until each bucket is filled and each pitcher is empty. You take your pitcher (the account) and start pouring into a bucket (the asset class). If you fill the bucket and the pitcher still has fluid (money), then fill the next bucket. If your pitcher runs out of fluid, then go to the next pitcher.

When you are done, every pitcher is empty and every bucket should be full. Each bucket will contain fluid from the different accounts, but overall each bucket will be full so that you have the right amount in each asset class.

[[Image:MultiAccountPortfolioAssetClassesByAccount.png|right|300px|thumb|'''Portfolio 3''' with asset classes spanning across accounts, based on [[#Portfolio 3 - Spread Asset Allocation]] above]]
The bucket/pitcher analogy is represented by '''Portfolio 3''', shown in the nearby bar chart that breaks the portfolio down by its three major asset class. Notice how the three buckets, one for each asset class, are filled by the "fluid" from the three accounts.

The trick to this exercise is you do not want to randomly pour your pitchers into the various buckets -- you want to strategically pour the the right fluids (accounts) into the right buckets (asset classes) by observing the [[#Principles of asset allocation across multiple accounts|principles of asset allocation across multiple accounts]] outlined above in this article.

=== Flowchart for allocating ===
[[Image:AssetAllocationMultipleAccountsFlow.png|right|thumb|600px|'''Figure 2''' - Allocating money to funds across multiple accounts]]The bucket-and-pitcher analogy described previously can be depicted by a process flowchart that shows how to fill the buckets. That flowchart is illustrated in '''Figure 2''' nearby. Moving from left to right you will:
# Identify the first '''account''' (bucket) to allocate.
# Identify the first '''fund''' in the account to allocate.
# Fill that fund until its asset class is full, or until the account has run out of  money, whichever comes first.
## If the asset class is full, and the account still has money, then go to #2 and repeat.
## If the asset class is not full, but the account has run out of money, then go to #1 and repeat until all accounts have been allocated.

The steps in the flowchart are outlined in more detail in the sections below.

=== Determine asset allocation ===
{{main|Asset allocation}}
The first step is to choose your [[Asset allocation|asset allocation]], basically your allocation to [[Stock basics|stocks]], [[Bond basics|bonds]], and [[Money markets|cash]]. Be sure to consider this in the context of your entire [[Portfolio|portfolio]]. The allocations should reflect your return needs for return, balanced against your [[Risk tolerance|tolerance for risk]]. For most investors this will mean hopefully gaining returns that, in the long run, outpace [[CPI|inflation]], while reducing the magnitude of short term investment losses to a level that allows the investor to remain invested without panic selling.

=== Calculate asset classes ===
Next, work out the percentages you want to hold in US Stocks, International Stocks and Bonds. If you want to overweight smaller sectors ([[REIT|REITs]], [[Small caps|small cap value]], etc.) then determine those percentages as well. If you want to split your bond holdings in different types, then determine those percentages. For example, suppose you want to hold 60% stocks and 40% bonds, with one-third of your stocks in international. That comes out to:
* US: 40% (2/3 * 60%)
* International: 20% (1/3 * 60%)
* Bonds: 40%

=== Start with problematic account ===
{{See also|Tax-efficient fund placement}}
Start with the plan or account that has the most expensive or most limited choice of funds. In most cases, this will be a 401k or other employer-sponsored retirement plan.

==== Selecting the fund ====
Scan your fund listings and look for any index funds with low expense ratios. In most cases, the lowest-expense funds will be index funds. Find the lowest fee fund. In most cases, this fund will be an [[S&amp;P 500 index]] fund. Note that the actual name of the fund might not actually be S&amp;P 500 Index Fund. It might be called '''500 Index''', '''Equity Index''', '''Large Cap Index''' or some other name. You may need to read your plan information carefully determine the fund’s composition.

Your plan might also have a Total US Stock Index fund. If the expense ratio is not much higher than the S&amp;P 500 Index fund in your plan (if any), then so much the better—-it is generally easier to work with a Total US Stock Market index fund when creating a portfolio. If you do not have a Total US Stock Market Index Fund, but you have a 500-index fund an extended market index fund, then you can pair these two funds as described below.

Put all your assets in that fund, up to the amount you need for that asset class, and up to your account balance.

For example, given the sample account above, if you have a $100,000 balance in all your retirement accounts, then you want to hold $40,000 in US Total Stock Market. Suppose your 401k has a US Total Stock Market fund, and your 401k balance is $25,000. In this case, put all $25,000 in that fund; you will then move on to the rest of your funds to fill up the other asset classes.

If your 401k balance is $50,000, then put $40,000 to the Total US Stock Market Fund. After that, you still have $10,000 more to allocate in the 401k.

==== Allocating around a S&amp;P 500 index fund ====
If your plan only has a [[S&amp;P 500 Index|S&amp;P 500]] index fund, but no Total US Stock Market Index Fund, then you should use the 500 Index fund up to around 80% of the total amount you want to allocate to US Stock. You should then complement the 500 Index fund with [[Small cap|small-cap]] or a combination of [[Mid caps|mid-cap]] and small-cap to [[Approximating Total Stock Market|approximate total stock market]]; see linked article for exact ratios depending on which small/mid cap or [[Extended market index fund|extended market index fund]]s you can use in other accounts.

For example, a $100,000 portfolio that needs $40,000 in US Stocks would need $32,000 in a S&amp;P 500 index and $8,000 in an extended market index fund; again, see linked article for up-to-date exact percentages for various small/mid-cap funds.

So, if your 401k balance is under $32,000, then put all of it in the S&amp;P 500 index fund. If the balance is over $32,000, then put $32,000 in the S&amp;P 500 Index fund. Next, you can either put the remaining in International or Bond funds as described in [[#Guidelines for international funds|Guidelines for international funds]] and [[#Guidelines for bond funds |Guidelines for bond funds]], or find complementary small/mid cap funds in the same plan.

If you can find suitable small/mid-cap index funds or an extended market index fund, and the expense ratios are less than suitable international or bond index funds, then use the small-cap/mid-cap/extended market index funds up to the amount you need to fill the US Total Stock Market asset class. If your balance is less than the amount needed, then you would need to use a similar fund in a different account to complete your holdings.  If you balance is more than the amount needed, then go to the next section ([[#Allocating to remaining accounts|Allocating to remaining accounts]]).

If the account balance is less than 80% of your US stock allocation (for example, you need $40,000 in US Stock but your account balance is $50,000), then choose the cheapest and best index fund, if any, in the international or bond class. In many 401k plans, this is where it becomes more complicated because the quality of choices is mediocre. You will just need to find the best you can

==== Guidelines for international stock funds ====
Look for a fund with a name like International Index, Total International Index, International Equity, MSCI All-World ex US, or other fund names that suggest a total market international fund. Generally, if there is an index fund, it will be the least expensive international fund in the plan. You may need to study your funds carefully to find the right fund.

If you do not have an international index fund, then finding the right fund is beyond the scope of this article. Assuming you want to emulate the Vanguard Total International Stock Market Index Fund ([{{Vf | 0113}} VGTSX]) then you will want to find a large-cap blend that tracks the Vanguard fund as closely as possible. Ideally, look for funds that have some emerging markets.

==== Guidelines for bond funds ====
Similar to international stock fund, look for a bond fund with "index" or "total" in its name. You will probably need to study your funds more closely to see if there is an index fund in your plan. Look for a fund that tracks the  [[Bloomberg US Aggregate Bond Index]], which is the same index the Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Fund ([{{Vf | 0084}} VBMFX]) tracks.

If you do not have a bond index fund, then choosing which bond fund(s) is beyond the scope of this article.

==== Choosing between international or bonds if neither is ideal ====
If you have to choose between an international choice or a bond choice in a plan, and neither is ideal, then you might want to consider the following:
* All things being equal, choose the fund with the lowest expense ratio; you can use other accounts for the other asset class
* If you have taxable accounts, then generally you will want to hold international stocks in taxable and bonds in tax-advantaged, so choose the bond fund for a tax-advantaged account; see [[Principles of tax-efficient fund placement]] for more information.
* All things being equal, choose the more "complete" fund that will not require you to complement the fund with another fund in a different account (for example, if you have an international fund with only developed markets, then you would need to hold a complementary emerging markets fund in a different account if you wanted to have a complete international portfolio).
* If you have another account with a limited number of options, then look at the options in the same asset classes in the other account and try to pick the best combination between the two of them.

Once you identify the next fund (whether bonds or international), then fill up that account up to the maximum you need, up to your account balance. If you still need more money in that asset class, then use your other accounts. If you still have money left over in the first account to allocate, then go to the third and final asset class and find the best fund for that class, using the same principles described above.

=== Allocating to remaining accounts ===
Once you have allocated all your money in the first account, then move to the next account. If you have more than one account with limited choices, then move to the next-most-difficult account and apply the same principles above, by finding the best and cheapest index fund in an asset class you need, using it up to the amount you need, etc.

Once you have taken care of the problematic accounts with constraints, then you can move to the accounts where you have more flexibility (typically traditional IRA or Roth IRA accounts).

Repeat until you have allocated all the money in all your accounts. Generally, if you have smaller accounts, try to fill those up with a single fund. In your largest account, where you will likely need to hold two or more funds, it can be advantageous to arrange your holdings so that you can have a fund from each of your asset classes. Depending on your overall portfolio, doing so can mean that you can do all your rebalancing in one account simply by making exchanges between the funds in the largest account.

=== Considerations about rebalancing across accounts===
{{See also|Rebalancing}}
Assuming you have used the principles above to create a perfectly balanced portfolio today, you need to consider how ongoing contributions or planned withdrawals will affect your asset allocation.

Generally, you want to ensure that you can keep your asset allocation intact into the future without needing to do frequent [[Rebalancing|rebalances]] or exchanges. If you can find a way to do this without compromising other principles, then do so as it is important to have a maintenance-friendly portfolio.

One way to keep a portfolio balanced with future contributions is, when possible, to have your largest account hold funds in all three asset classes. Ideally, you are still contributing to this account so that you can rebalance with contributions as well as fund-to-fund exchanges, if necessary. In your smaller accounts, if the math works, have each account contain a single asset class each in order to eliminate the need to do exchanges in those smaller accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{forum link| p=1344633| title=Same Vanguard funds in multiple accounts OR ... ???| date=March 24, 2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, suppose you have a dormant account to which you can no longer contribute, but which you cannot (or do not want to) transfer into an account that to which you can contribute. That account is 40% of your portfolio, and you want to hold 40% of your portfolio in bonds. If you put all your money in that account in bonds, then you will be out of balance very soon unless you find another bond fund in a different account that into which you can direct 40% of future contributions. As that one account gradually decreases its share of your overall portfolio (even as its balance, you hope, grows), your other accounts will need to hold more bonds to keep your 40%.

Another difficulty arises when you have one smaller account that holds two asset classes. Suppose it holds international and bonds, with $5,000 in each, in a Vanguard IRA, and you are no longer contributing to this account. Remember that the Vanguard minimum for these funds is $3,000. Suppose you heavily are adding bonds in a different account (like a 401k). To keep your bond allocation where it needs to be, you might periodically transfer some money from the bond fund in the IRA to the international fund. At some point, the balance in the bond fund will hit the minimum. At this point or sometime in the near future, you may need to exchange all the bond funds into international. This may upset your asset allocation by a few percentage points in your asset classes, but there might not be much you can do. In most cases, though, the $3,000 shift will eventually be corrected as future contributions fill in the gaps.

== Conflicting principles ==
Ideally, you can construct a portfolio that meets all of these principles. In many cases, however, you must make compromises because it may be impossible to satisfy two or more conflicting principles simultaneously. Examples may include:
* You can construct a perfectly balanced portfolio today, but all of your bond holdings are in one account that you no longer contribute to. This means that as future contributions are added, your bond allocation will immediately start falling below your desired allocation.
* You have a 401k plan with funds that have high expense ratios across the board, with the exception of one low-expense S&amp;P 500 index fund. You would like to use only that S&amp;P 500 index fund in your 401k, but your 401k balance is too big to put all of your money in only that one fund Therefore you are forced to select a less-than-ideal 2nd fund in your 401k that you might ordinarily want to avoid.
* You must hold some international stocks in your 401(k) to meet your overall asset class targets, but the only desirable fund is not as diversified as you would like (for example, it might exclude small-caps or [[Emerging market stocks|emerging markets]]). You would like to hold a complementary emerging markets fund in another account to “complete” your international holdings, but you might not have that option or the amount you need might be under the minimum amount to open the fund.
* You would like to compose your entire portfolio of index funds, but one account contains only actively-managed funds and it is difficult to determine the best choice.
* You must hold US Stocks in your 401k. You have an S&amp;P 500 index and a mid-cap index. But, the 500 Index has a high expense ratio and the mid-cap index has a low expense ratio. You are conflicted between holding the theoretically correct asset class and paying reasonable expenses.
* Following [[Principles of tax-efficient fund placement#Step 4: Place high growth stock funds|Principles of tax-efficient fund placement - place high growth stock funds]], you might prefer to put stock funds in  a Roth IRA, but if you have a 401k with low-expense stock funds and high-expense and/or inferior choices of bond funds, then you might be better off putting bonds in the Roth IRA to have lower expenses in the 401k.
* You may want to hold in your US stock a total US stock market index fund, or an approximation of one. But in your 401k plan, you might have a low-fee S&amp;P 500 index fund and a high-expense actively managed small cap fund. In this case, the benefit of holding a more diversified holding of both S&amp;P 500 and small cap fund may be outweighed by the additional expenses the small cap fund. In some cases, it may be better to omit the small cap fund entirely.

=== Which principle wins? ===
Taking the scenarios above, there is not always a clear cut answer when two principles are in conflict.

For example, in the last scenario above, the conflict is between having a complete total stock market allocation comprised of an S&amp;P 500 fund and a complementary small cap fund. You would like to hold both to get complete exposure to US stocks, but the small cap fund has a high expense ratio. If the expense ratios for the funds were 0.10% and 0.20%, then by all means hold both funds. But if the ratios are 0.3% and 1.1%, then the case for choosing the small cap fund over holding exclusively S&amp;P 500 is less convincing. Somewhere along that continuum you must decide which is the better choice.

=== Low balance portfolios ===
If you are just building your portfolio it can be difficult to make the math work with multiple accounts because you might not be able to divide your slices into pieces that are more than the fund minimums. For example, most Vanguard mutual funds have a $3,000 minimum (with the exception of some all-in-one funds). As a result, you may need to underweight or overweight a particular asset class in the present or in the near future if future contributions cannot be made proportionally to funds in each asset class.

In these cases your options are:
* Use an all-in-one fund in the small account until the balance is big enough to split into single funds.
* Use [[Exchange-traded funds|ETFs]] – not necessarily recommended for inexperienced investors, and can add trading expenses.
* Use mutual funds in other fund families that have lower minimums.
* Omit a slice until your balances grow enough. This may skew your asset allocation slightly, for example, holding all of your US Stocks in an S&amp;P 500 fund because you do not have enough in another account to open a complementary small cap fund.

See {{forum link| t=98314| title=Portfolio checkup| date=June 20, 2012}}, for a detailed example of a scenario of the challenges and options of crafting a multi-account portfolio and maintaining your target asset allocation when you cannot make future contributions in the same proportions as your target asset allocation.

=== Taxable accounts ===
Another constraint may be in a taxable account that holds some funds that you cannot easily sell because of [[Tax loss harvesting|tax issues]]. In these cases, you may need to work around the holdings in the taxable account.

== Factors leading to complex portfolios ==
While a simple portfolio is generally preferred over a complex portfolio, there are a number of justifications for introducing complexity to a portfolio or deviating from the general principles of allocating assets across a whole portfolio.&lt;ref&gt;Personal Email expounding on these factors from [[User:Blbarnitz]] on 14 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Asset protection ===
{{main|Asset protection}}
Asset protection concerns might lead to a change in asset location policy.

=== Marital conflicts over investing philosophy ===
Marital issues may come into play. One spouse may have a much lower [[risk]] tolerance than the other, and be very uncomfortable holding a high allocation to volatile investments in their share of accounts. On the other hand, a potential future divorce settlement arguably makes it advisable that each spouse, regardless of risk tolerance, should have at least some equity exposure in their accounts, so that the individually owned accounts are valued more equally.

=== Slice and dice ===
{{main|Slice and dice}}
If you have a "slice and dice" portfolio, you will usually have a more complex allocation across accounts than if you used a [[Three fund portfolio|three-fund-portfolio]].

=== Investor behavior ===
One argument for having balanced accounts throughout a portfolio is that some investors tend to look at single accounts in isolation instead of as a unified whole portfolio. 

For example, suppose one investor has $100,000 in a tax-deferred account in bonds, and a $100,000 taxable account with stocks.  A different investor has the same overall asset allocation, but each account is split equally between stocks and bonds.

If stocks decline 40%, the first investor will see his taxable account decline 40%. Assuming that bonds have a 0% change, the second investor will see each account decline by 20%. The first investor might focus on the losses in the taxable account, rather than looking at those losses spread over his entire portfolio, and abandon his strategy out of fear of losing more. That same investor might not be as alarmed if both accounts go down 20%, even though in the end both scenarios are essentially identical.

This difficulty of trying to protect investors from this behavioral pitfall is expressed by [[Rick Ferri]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{forum link| p=1426569| title=Advisor suggests same allocation across account types| date=June 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{blockquote|[T]here is a hidden risk with having different allocations in taxable versus non-taxable, and we saw this risk turn into reality during 2008 and early 2009. A few clients terminated their higher risk taxable portfolio because that specific portfolio was losing more money than the more conservative non-taxable portfolio. In other words, they separated their portfolios in their mind and compared returns rather than looking at the big picture.}}
&lt;!-- NOTE: EVENTUALLY I'D LIKE TO ADD SOME CASE STUDIES, BUT I HAVE COMMENTED OUT FOR NOW --&gt;
&lt;!--
Case Studies
The following case studies illustrate each of the principles. Although these scenarios are somewhat simplified, you can adapt these principles to your own situation.

Case 1

In this case, you have the following accounts and funds. These

401k: 50,000
IRA: 25,000

401k funds
S&amp;P 500 Index Fund 0.2% ER
Bond Fund 0.8% ER
Small Cap Blend Index Fund: 0.6% ER
International Fund 0.9% ER

Roth IRA - Vanugard 


Future contributions:
401k: 16,000
Roth IRA: 3,000

Desired AA:
60/40

US: 40
International: 20
Bonds: 40

Initial allocation:
32% S&amp;P 500
8% Small Cap Index Fund
26% Bonds

IRA
20% International
14% Bonds

Workflow:
First, start with the account with the highest fees, in this case the 401k. Pinpoint the desirable index fund with the lowest expense and maximize your holding in it, up to the limit in your asset allocation. In this case, it is the S&amp;P 500 Index Fund. Across all of your portfolio, the most you want to hold in S&amp;P 500 is 80% of your US Stocks, which is 40%. That comes to 32% (80% * 40% = 32%).

Next, you need to fill out more space in the 401k. Choose the next lowest-expense fund that can fit into your asset allocation. In this case, it is the small cap index fund, and you want 8% of it.

You still have 26% left of your portfolio that you need to allocate. Choose the next lowest-expense fund, which is Bond, and fill it up. That gives you 26% of bonds in the 401k.

Now that the 401k plan is filled, move to your Roth IRA. You need 14% more to get your Bonds to 40%. The remainder, 20% is left for International.


Case 2

401k: $20,000
Roth IRA at Vanguard: $25,000
IRA at Vanguard: $10,000

Ongoing contributions:
401k: $8,000
Roth IRA: $5,000
IRA: $0.00

AA:
US Stock: 40%
International Stock: 20%
Bonds: 40%

Funds available in 401k:

401k:
36% TSM

Roth IRA
4% - TSM ! Problem - balance too low

Case 3
Taxable

You can use an assortment of tools to design and manage portfolios that span multiple accounts. In addition to the spreadsheets there are various utilities to design and manage portfolios that span multiple accounts. Most cannot automatically compose your ideal portfolio, but you can use them to enter two or three models that you composed, and then you can compare and contrast the results, looking in particular at the blended expense ratios and the totals of each asset class. 
Two popular tools are: 
*[[Vanguard Portfolio Watch]] is an online tool for Vanguard clients to track asset allocation. 
*[[Tools_and_calculators#Portfolio_tools|Morningstar Instant X-Ray]] is a tool especially useful for breaking down a portfolio into asset allocations and style boxes.

Additionally, you could use one of the many spreadsheets:

This article will address how to incorporate the investment options in [[Employer retirement plans overview | employer retirement plans]] to create a [[Lazy portfolios | lazy portfolio]].&lt;ref group="note"&gt;This technique will work for any list of funds. However, assistance with employer plans is a common request by new investors in the Bogleheads forum; so we will focus on this aspect.&lt;/ref&gt;

The process starts by deciding on a stock / bond asset allocation, reviewing the available funds, then selecting the appropriate funds to create the portfolio. 

The article illustrates two asset allocation plans using a 60% / 40% stock to bond allocation:
*For total market investors: A three-fund indexed portfolio;
*For multifactor ([[Slice and dice |"slice and dice"]]) investors: The seven-fund indexed Coffeehouse portfolio.

==Asset allocation==
{{Main | Asset Allocation}}
The first step when starting an investment program is to choose your [[Asset allocation|asset allocation]], basically your allocation to [[Stock basics|stocks]], [[Bond basics|bonds]], and [[Money markets|cash]]. Be sure to consider this in the context of your entire [[Portfolio|portfolio]]. When beginning participation in an employer's retirement plan, this means incorporating both the plan investments and your existing investments in your overall allocations. The allocations should reflect your return needs balanced against your [[Risk tolerance|tolerance for risk]]. For most investors this will mean hopefully gaining returns that, in the long run, outpace [[CPI|inflation]], while reducing the magnitude of short term investment losses to a level that allows the investor to remain invested without panic selling.

Document your chosen asset allocation in your [[investment policy statement]], if you would not yet have completed it.

==Sample portfolios==
{{main|lazy portfolios}}
The following sample portfolios depict two different asset allocation plans. For illustrative purposes, each portfolio holds a 60 / 40 equity / bond allocation.

===Three-fund portfolio (for total market investors)===
[[File:Newchart.png|thumb|right|Three-fund portfolio with a 60/40 asset allocation]]
The [[Three-fund portfolio |three-fund portfolio]] attempts to simplify the investing process by using three total market [[Indexing|index]] funds holding broadly diversified stock and bond investments. The portfolio is meant to be a buy-hold-and [[Rebalancing|rebalance]] portfolio. The three asset classes required for this portfolio are listed below:&lt;ref group="note"&gt; For example, [http://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=1&amp;t=122957 Forum discussion 401k investment] offers the options displayed in the table below. The plan contains Vanguard target retirement funds and standalone fund selections, which are suitable for creating a three-fund portfolio. (''Open table to view fund options and expense ratios.'')

In this instance, the investor can capture the three fund portfolio by using the fund selections in the table below. Selecting a Vanguard target retirement fund would create a variant of the three-fund portfolio, as the funds' add an [[Developed market bonds|international bond]] index fund to the portfolio. [[Vanguard target retirement funds|Vanguard target date retirement funds]] are [[Vanguard four fund portfolio|four-fund portfolios]].

==Multiple accounts==
{{main|Asset allocation in multiple accounts|Tax-efficient fund placement}}
A frequently encountered situation is that the investment portfolio is allocated to a multiplicity of accounts. For example, a husband and wife may both have employer provider plans, both have personal retirement plans, both have taxable accounts. This equals six accounts.&lt;ref group="note"&gt; In addition to the doubling of marital investment accounts (employer provided retirement accounts, personal retirement accounts, and taxable accounts), it is possible to have even more potential accounts. These additional accounts may include:
* Supplemental employer retirement plans , such as a [[457(b)|457(b) plan]]. 
* Inherited non-spousal IRAs, which, by law, cannot be mingled with other IRA accounts.
* [[Health savings account|Health savings accounts]].
* [[Fixed annuity|Fixed]] or [[Variable annuity|variable]] deferred annuities.
* College savings plans, such as a [[529 plans|529 plan]] or a [[Coverdell Education Savings Account]].
* A [[Charitable remainder trust|charitable remainder trust]] or a [[Charitable pooled income fund|charitable pooled income fund]]. &lt;/ref&gt;

Even if you are a single individual, it is possible to accumulate accounts over an investing lifetime. For example an individual might accumulate a current employer provided plan, a rollover IRA holding the assets from a past job's 401(k) plan, a Roth IRA, and a taxable account.
 
In this situation you would need to repeat the actions over the different accounts:

# Determine our overall asset allocation.
# Perform the checklist on the employer retirement plan as mentioned in the next section.
# Gather the expense ratio for each fund in each account, as well as the tax efficiency. 
# If some accounts do not offer an asset class, or close alternative, then the accounts which do have that asset class should be filled first, with lower expense ratios taking priority.
# Fill in remainder of your total asset allocation with the lowest expense ratios from each account, taking into account the tax considerations. 
# Add up the total amount for each asset class and ensure that your asset allocation is as desired.

==Selecting the funds - Employer plan checklist==
For the chosen asset allocation you then need to review the available funds and select the appropriate ones.

Employer plans can have many investment options, presenting investors with a long list of unfamiliar names. The following checklist can help you find the offerings that can help fill your desired asset allocations. For our sample portfolios, we would be looking for index funds matching our targeted asset classes.

=== Employer plan checklist ===

For each item in the plan fund list, find the available asset class exposure that the funds provide and their [[Expense ratios|expense ratios]].&lt;ref group="note"&gt; 401(k) plans can impose administrative costs on employees in addition to fund expense ratios. Many 401(k) and 403(b) plans are funded with variable annuity contracts which can impose fees in addition to the funds' expense ratios. Make sure you are aware of the total costs. &lt;/ref&gt; This information can usually be found in the fund's fact sheets.&lt;ref group="note"&gt; Hint: Put everything in a spreadsheet. It's easier to make updates and will help when calculating percentages and fund amounts later on.&lt;/ref&gt;

Look for the major asset class categories, such as [[Stock basics|US stock]], [[Domestic/International|international stock]], [[Small caps|small cap stocks]], [[Value tilting - stock|value stocks]] and [[Bond basics|US bonds]]. Fixed income (cash reserves) counts as bonds; company stock funds count as stock. Some bond funds may be listed as "inflation protected." 

Since our desired portfolios are indexed, seek out the plan's index funds, such as the "SSgA S&amp;P 500 Index" (US stocks) or "SSgA US Bond Index" (US bonds) or "SSgA Global Equity Ex US Index" (International stocks, which sometimes have an alphabet soup of acronyms like [[MSCI EAFE index|MSCI EAFE]]). The fund's fact sheet will list the asset allocation information.&lt;ref group="note"&gt; For an example of a plan with a mixture of index funds and active funds on the plan fund menu, see the fund options in the plan revealed in [http://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=1&amp;t=123516 Any good funds in this list], forum discussion.

Employer provided plans typically contain at least one or two index funds. Some plans may have a [[Self directed brokerage account|brokerage window]] that provides access to a wider selection of indexed investment options, but be sure to calculate the expected cost of using this service, taking into account all fees that would apply and compare it to the cost of using the fund choices in the qualified plan in order to help guide the decision. 

The plan may not provide total market index funds. A common example is a plan offering only an [[S&amp;P 500 index]] fund. You may want to approximate the total market by using funds that "complete" the S&amp;P 500 index. Similarly, plans often provide international exposure with a developed market index fund, which lacks the [[Emerging market stocks|emerging market stocks]] and small cap international stocks included in international total market funds. (You may not need to replicate a total market fund for every asset class if you can hold total market funds in other accounts.) 

If you decide to reconstitute a total market fund using multiple funds, you can find detailed information on how to approximate total market allocations at:
*[[Approximating total stock market]] 
*[[Approximating total international stock market]]

The plan may only contain actively managed funds. In this circumstance you should select the lowest cost stock funds and highest grade bond funds that approximate the targeted assets classes.&lt;ref group="note"&gt; For example, 
[http://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=1&amp;t=123565 401k Choices Seem Expensive], forum discussion reveals a 401(k) plan offering only active funds. (''Open table to reveal fund options and expense ratios'').

Note that if you hold [[#Multiple accounts|multiple accounts]], you need not hold each of your portfolio's asset classes ''within'' the employer plan, unless you prefer to mirror the allocation in each account. The allocations can be spread across accounts (as an example: holding the bond allocations in an employer plan; the US stock investments in a personal IRA, and holding international investments in a [[Principles of tax-efficient fund placement|taxable account]].)

==Target date retirement funds==

A good default option for employer provider plans is to place your contributions and employer matches into a [[Target date retirement funds|target date retirement fund]]. 

Some plans may provide you with target retirement plans with indexed target date funds which can provide you with a variant of the three-fund portfolio. Examples would include plans holding Vanguard target retirement funds and the [[Thrift Savings Plan]] target retirement fund series.

If you are thinking of using a target date fund be aware that many plans offer retirement date funds that invest in a large number of actively managed funds. You need to carefully check the underlying funds to see if they truly match your desired allocation.&lt;ref group="note"&gt; For example, Fidelity Freedom 2035 Target Date fund employs 24 actively managed funds as the underlying investments for the fund (see [https://fundresearch.fidelity.com/mutual-funds/composition/315792655 Analyze the Fidelity Freedom 2035 Fund (FFTHX) composition]). American funds employ 17 active funds in its [https://americanfundsretirement.retire.americanfunds.com/about/funds/details.htm?ticker=AAFTX target fund]. T. Rowe Price uses 17 active funds and one index fund in its [http://www3.troweprice.com/fb2/fbkweb/composition.do?ticker=TRRJX 2035 fund]. American Century uses 13 active funds in its [https://ipro.americancentury.com/ipro/product/mf/holdings/954.jsp#ARYIX 2035 target fund]&lt;/ref&gt;

An advantage of tax-deferred accounts is that you can transfer among the different funds without paying taxes on the gains. In other words, you are not stuck with this decision. There is no penalty for changing your mind later. If you feel more confident about lowering your expenses by going to separate low-cost funds at a later time, you are free to do so.

===Using a target date fund to approximate a lazy portfolio===
{{Main | Approximating Vanguard target date funds}}
If you are a novice investor seeking to use a three-fund or four fund portfolio, Vanguard's [[Target date retirement funds]] can provide models for your portfolio since they are nothing more than lazy portfolios, using total market index funds, designed and managed by investment professionals. Your decision is to simply align your desired asset allocations with the appropriate target retirement fund.

Refer to the [[Approximating Vanguard target date funds|main article]] for a comprehensive overview. 

==Inflation-protected securities==
Bond funds identified as inflation-protected, like [[Treasury Inflation Protected Security | TIPS]], are somewhat different than a conventional bond fund. Their purpose is to help diversify your portfolio further by providing some protection against inflation.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Inflation-protected securities actually protect against ''unexpected'' inflation, which is not discussed here.&lt;/ref&gt;

One Boglehead approach is to add inflation-protected securities to the bond portion of your portfolio, perhaps up to 50% of the bond allocation. The choice is arbitrary - from not using any inflation-protected fund up to 50% (or more). The decision is based on a level of comfort (can you sleep well at night) rather than one based on theory.

Note that some of the examples and references date back to 2013, and the applicable values may no longer be accurate.  Nonetheless the methodology should still be applicable.}}
'''{{PAGENAME}}''' aims to help you if you are saving and investing in an [[Employer retirement plans overview|employer provided plan]] and want to approximate a Vanguard target date fund based on the funds in your plan. 

If you are lucky enough to have an employer plan with a wide selection of low-cost asset class index funds, you can probably closely approximate a target date fund with a limited number of funds. 

However, you may find that your plan has high costs, offering a lot of funds but few of which are index funds. For you, creating a simple, low cost approximation can be more difficult. You might need to use other accounts to reach the asset allocation you are aiming for.

This article describes the how to approximate a target date fund, and include a comprehensive example. It also shows several cases where approximating target retirement funds is suitable.

==Principles of approximating Vanguard target date funds==
[[File:Fourfunds.png|thumb|right| Four-fund portfolio&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The above graphic represents that there are four primary components to a target date fund. It does not indicate that a typical allocation is 25% in each.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The [[Vanguard target retirement funds|Vanguard target date retirement funds]] are '''[[Vanguard four fund portfolio|four-fund portfolios]].''' The four asset class index funds making up this buy-hold-and rebalance portfolio are:
* A US total stock market index fund
* A total international stock market index fund
* A US total bond market index fund
* A total international bond market index fund
The Vanguard Target Retirement Income fund, as well as the funds that are closing in on their target dates add a fifth fund, the Vanguard Short-Term Inflation Indexed Bond Index. 

Target date funds change allocations over time. If you approximate a target retirement fund you will need to '''change allocations regularly''' to follow changes in the target retirement fund you are approximating. See table [[Vanguard target retirement funds#Detailed fund allocations|Vanguard target retirement funds - Detailed fund allocations]].

Before Vanguard added international bonds, target funds held the [[three-fund portfolio]] without international bonds. If you want to approximate a target retirement fund, but you do not want to hold international bonds, you can replace these international bonds with domestic bonds.

==Constituent total market funds==
The three-fund and four-fund portfolios have one thing in common: Every index fund name contains "total." This section shows the "total" index fund compositions.

===US total stock market funds===
{| class="wikitable" style="float:right; margin-left:10px"
|+ Fund style box (%)&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The weightings shown here are for illustration only.&lt;/ref&gt;
| {{MStarStylebox|26|22|24|6|6|7|3|3|3}}
|}
These funds invest in the investable US public stock markets, weighting stocks according to their [[Market capitalization|market capitalization]]. They will include large-cap, [[Mid caps|mid-cap]], and [[Small caps|small-cap]] stocks. A [https://www.morningstar.com/content/dam/marketing/apac/au/pdfs/Legal/Stylebox_Factsheet.pdf style box] shows the percentage of stocks in each weighting category. Summing all categories equals 100%.  The weighting of these components can change over time. Current Vanguard and Fidelity total US stock market fund weightings are available [https://www.morningstar.com/funds/xnas/vtsax/portfolio here] and [https://www.morningstar.com/funds/xnas/fskax/portfolio here]. 

====Approximating US total stock market funds====
{{main|Approximating total stock market}}
It is likely that you will find only an [[S&amp;P 500 Index|S&amp;P 500 index]] fund in your retirement plan. In this case, for total market coverage you need to add a [[Extended market index fund|completion index]] fund, or a combination of mid cap and small cap index funds. 

In some cases, you may have these funds in your plan. The [[Thrift Savings Plan]], the federal workers retirement savings plan, for example, offers both an S&amp;P 500 index fund and an extended market completion index fund. Some plans may also offer a mid cap index fund and a small cap index fund in addition to the S&amp;P 500 index fund, which makes it possible to approximate the US total market. 

====Without suitable options for US total stock market funds====
If your plan lacks suitable options to capture the rest of market, you may be able to do this by:
* Investing in these completion indexes in a personal retirement plan or taxable account;
* Forgo investing in the S&amp;P 500 fund and hold the total market fund allocation in a personal retirement plan or taxable account.
* If married, invest in these completion indexes in your spouse's accounts.
* If married, forgo investing in the S&amp;P 500 fund and hold the total market fund allocation in one of your spouse's accounts.

===Total international stock market index fund===
The most complete total international index funds invest in both developed market and emerging market stocks, and hold market allocations to large-cap, mid-cap, and small-cap stocks. 

===Approximating total international stock market index fund===
{{main|Approximating total international stock market}}
Some international index funds will only cover developed markets, and many international index funds only include large-cap and mid-cap stocks. In these cases, you can consider adding emerging market and small cap international index funds. Depending on the specific indexes used for developed markets and emerging markets, completely replicating the total market could mean that you need to add Canadian and South Korean index funds.

The approximate breakdown between developed market, emerging market, and global-ex US small cap stocks is:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://institutional.vanguard.com/investments/product-details/fund/0113| title=Vanguard Total International Fund| publisher=Vanguard}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Developed market: 65%
*Emerging market: 20%
*Global ex-US small cap: 15%

Depending on the availability of emerging market and small cap international index funds, you might be able to add them in your employer's plan, in your individual retirement plans or taxable accounts, or if married, in your spouse's accounts. An additional option is to forgo investing in a developed market index fund and hold a total international index fund in another account (if married, this can also include a spouse's account).

===Total US bond index funds===
In the US, a total bond index is commonly benchmarked to the [[Bloomberg US Aggregate Bond Index]], which benchmarks investment grade taxable bonds. These include [[Treasury bonds|treasury]] and [[Government agency bonds|government agency]] bonds, investment grade [[Corporate bonds|corporate bonds]], [[Mortgage-backed securities|mortgage-backed securities]] and [[Asset-backed securities|asset-backed securities]]. The index does not include [[Treasury Inflation Protected Securities|Treasury inflation protected securities]], [[High yield bonds|high yield]] bonds, [[Floating rate bonds|floating rate]] bonds, or [[Municipal bonds|municipal]] bonds. The total US bond market index has an intermediate term duration.

===Total international bond index funds===
Most forum investors will be considering the Vanguard international bond index fund, which is hedged against currencies, and invests in international government, agency, and corporate bonds, primarily from developed countries. The index has an intermediate term duration.

==Example of approximating a Vanguard target date fund==
Below is an illustrative example, as of August 31, 2013, which builds a target date fund asset allocation from a 401(k) plan's list of available funds.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;See {{forum link| t=122977| title=First 401(k) Advice}}. Disclaimer: The examples have no relation to the member's situation and are only illustrative.&lt;/ref&gt; The plan has:
*A lot of choices.
*Target retirement funds, but in this case these are inappropriate because they are [https://www.fidelity.com/mutual-funds/asset-allocation-funds/freedom-funds/overview Fidelity Freedom® Funds] that use 24 active funds.&lt;ref group="note"&gt; Actively managed target retirement funds often are a compilation of a large collection of actively managed funds. Here are the fund tallies from four large mutual fund complexes for target date 2035 funds:

*A Balanced fund, [https://fundresearch.fidelity.com/mutual-funds/summary/31634R109 Fidelity® Multi-Asset Index Fund], which approximates three quarters of the Vanguard target retirement fund (lacks international bonds) but comes with the limitation of having only one asset allocation (85% stocks/ 14% bonds).
*U.S. and international stock total market indexes and a US bond index that match three quarters of the Vanguard target retirement fund and fulfill the requirements for a three-fund portfolio.
*A developed international market index.

===Goal===
The following examples use an asset allocation of 60% / 40% stocks to bonds. By design, Vanguard allocates 28% of a target date fund's stock allocation to international stocks and allocates 20% of a portfolio's bond allocation to international bonds. The [{{Vf | 0682}} Vanguard Target Retirement 2020 Fund (VTWNX)] is the closest match and holds the following total market index funds:&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The allocations below represent the Vanguard 2020 fund as they were in 2013.  The allocations as of today have significantly changed, as indicated in the above link, with a lower stock allocation and a higher bond allocation.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Approximating the U.S stock market allocation===
This plan holds a total U.S. stock market index fund. Replace the Vanguard funds as shown in the spreadsheet under "A total US stock market fund is available." Because it lacks a total international bond market index, one option is to use the US bond index fund in place of the international bond index fund. Round the asset allocations to the nearest 5%.

The following scenarios show how to approximate the U.S. total market segment, if we assume that the plan ''did not provide'' a total U.S. stock market index.

====No U.S. total stock market index fund is available (completion index)====
If the plan lacks a U.S. total stock market index fund, you can use the available completion index fund and reconstitute the total US market slice of the portfolio as follows:

S&amp;P 500 index fund with completion index fund. The total market approximation split would be: 
* S&amp;P 500 index: 80% of the US stock allocation
* Completion index: 20% of the US stock allocation.

Refer to in the spreadsheet under "If a total US stock market index fund is not available (Completion index)."  In this case, entering FXSIX (holding value of 80%) and FSEVX (holding value of 20%) will result in a Total US Stock style box that's very close to the one shown [[#US total stock market funds|above]].

Split the US total stock market index share by these percentages as shown:

*S&amp;P 500 index: 34.8% = 80% of 43.6%
*Completion index: 8.72% = 20% of 43.6%

This example uses extra precision (more decimal places) to show the methodology. In practice you round the final asset allocations to the nearest 5%. Rounding the example percentages gives this allocation:

*S&amp;P 500 index: 35%
*Completion index: 10%

====No U.S. total stock market index fund is available (small-cap and mid-cap)====
If the plan lacks both the U.S. total stock market index and a completion index fund, you could use the available small-cap and mid-cap index funds to approximate the US total market index:

S&amp;P 500 index fund with a mid-cap index fund and a small-cap index fund. The total market approximation split would be:
*S&amp;P 500: 80% of the US stock allocation
*Mid cap index: 5% of the US stock allocation
*Small cap index: 15% of the US stock allocation.

Refer to in the spreadsheet under "If a total US stock market index fund is not available (Mid-cap, small-cap)." As stated previously, use Morningstar's [https://www.morningstar.com/instant-x-ray Instant X-Ray]. In this case, entering FXSIX (holding value of 80%), FSCKX (holding value of 5%), and VSCIX (holding value of 15%) will result in a Total US Stock style box that's very close to the one shown [[#US total stock market funds|above]].

Split the US total stock market index share by these percentages as shown:

*S&amp;P 500: 34.88 % = 80% of 43.6%
*Mid cap index: 2.18 % = 5% of 43.6%
*Small cap index: 6.54% = 15% of 43.6%

This example uses extra precision (more decimal places) to show the methodology. In practice you round the final asset allocations to the nearest 5%. Rounding the example percentages gives this allocation:

*S&amp;P 500: 35%
*Mid cap index: 5%
*Small cap index: 5%

====No U.S. total stock market index fund is available (S&amp;P 500 index only)====
The plan only has an S&amp;P 500 index fund and neither of the above funds are available. In this case, you would need to use a completion index fund, or a combination of small-cap and mid-cap index funds held in ''other'' accounts (personal retirement accounts, a taxable account, or if married, one of your spouse's accounts) to approximate a total market position.

Otherwise, use the S&amp;P 500 index fund.

In addition, you might decide to totally forgo investing in the plan's US stock funds, by holding the US stock allocation in another account (or if married, in your spouse's account.)

===Approximating the international stock allocation===
This plan holds a total international stock market index fund; which is shown in the spreadsheet under "A total US stock market fund is available."&lt;ref group="note"&gt; Note that the plan's total international index fund tracks the MSCI All-World ex-US index, which covers the world's large-cap and mid-cap stocks. To more completely approximate the Vanguard target date fund allocations, you would need to add a global ex-US small cap fund. &lt;/ref&gt;

The following scenario shows how to approximate the international total market segment if the plan ''did not provide'' a total international index fund.

====No total international stock market index fund is available====
The plan has developed market index fund (SPTN International Index ADV (FSIVX)).

To partially approximate the total international fund, you would invest in the developed market index fund (FSIVX) but would need to add an emerging market index fund to the portfolio in another account. For a closer approximation, you would also need to add a global-ex U.S. small cap international index fund in another account. In this particular scenario, because the plan's developed market index tracks the [[MSCI EAFE index]], the allocation lacks exposure to Canada. If the added emerging market index does not include South Korea, this nation would also be missing from the allocation.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;For a precise replication of a Vanguard retirement date fund allocation to total international markets, see [[Approximating Total International Stock Market]]&lt;/ref&gt; 

In addition, you might decide to totally forgo investing in the plan's international stock funds, by holding the international allocation in another account (or if married, in your spouse's account.)

===Approximating the U.S. bond allocation===
This plan holds a U.S. total bond market index fund; which is shown in the spreadsheet under "A total US stock market fund is available."

The following scenario shows how to approximate the U.S. total bond market index, if we assume that the plan ''did not provide'' a total U.S bond index.

Refer to [[How to build a lazy portfolio#Inflation-protected securities |Inflation-protected securities]] for suggestions on incorporating inflation-protected bonds.

====No U.S. total bond market index fund is available====
The plan has a U.S. intermediate-term Treasury bond index fund available that provides the portfolio with an investment grade intermediate bond allocation. If you want to diversify the bond allocation, you can do it by holding additional bond funds in other accounts.&lt;ref group="note"&gt; If you must hold the total bond market index fund allocation in a taxable account, consider substituting a low-cost intermediate tax-exempt bond fund if this gives you better after-tax returns. &lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, you might decide to totally forgo investing in the plan's US bond funds, by holding the US bond allocation in another account (or if married, in your spouse's account.)

===Approximating the international bond allocation===
This plan does not provide an international bond allocation. You need to add an international bond allocation in another account.

Alternatively, if you do not want to hold international bonds, you could fill this allocation with a U.S. total bond index, U.S. Treasuries, [[How to build a lazy portfolio#Inflation-protected securities |Inflation-protected securities]] or, in taxable accounts, tax-exempt bonds.

A '''convertible security''' is a security— usually a [[Convertible bonds | bond]] or a [[Preferred stock|preferred stock]]— that can be converted into a different security—typically shares of the company's common stock. In most cases, the holder of the convertible determines whether and when to convert. In other cases, the company has the right to determine when the conversion occurs.&lt;ref name="SEC"&gt;[https://www.sec.gov/answers/convertibles.htm Convertible Securities - Convertibles (Fast Answer)], from the SEC.&lt;/ref&gt;

Companies generally issue convertible securities to raise money. Companies that have access to conventional means of raising capital, such as public offerings and bank financings, might offer convertible securities for particular business reasons. Companies that may be unable to tap conventional sources of funding sometimes offer convertible securities as a way to raise money more quickly.&lt;ref name="SEC" /&gt;

In a conventional convertible security financing, the conversion formula is generally fixed - meaning that the convertible security converts into common stock based on a fixed price. The convertible security financing arrangements might also include caps or other provisions to limit dilution (the reduction in earnings per share and proportional ownership that occurs when, for example, holders of convertible securities convert those securities into common stock).&lt;ref name="SEC" /&gt;

==Risk==
The most common issuers of both ''convertible bonds'' and ''convertible preferreds'' are non-investment-grade-rated companies. The convertible securities may be nonrated or rated below BBB– from the major rating agencies, such as Moody's or Standard &amp; Poor's. An interesting point to note is that most companies that issue convertibles don't default on their obligations, but credit analysis of each issuer is important because there is that risk.&lt;ref name="VG"&gt;[https://personal.vanguard.com/us/insights/article/keele-convertible-securities-04152013 What you need to know about convertible securities], from Vanguard.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="VT1"&gt;[http://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=1935162#p1935162 Can you talk me out of Preferred Stocks?], by forum member Valuethinker, direct link to post.&lt;/ref&gt;

Convertible bond risks are discussed in more detail [[Convertible bonds#Risks | here]].

''Convertible preferred shares'' are usually issued by financial companies to bolster capital ratios for regulatory reasons. They generally are not redeemable, i.e. they have no time limit. They are significantly riskier than convertible bonds given that:&lt;ref name="VT3"&gt;[http://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=1939165#p1939165 Re: Wiki - Convertible Securities], by forum member Valuethinker, direct link to post.&lt;/ref&gt;

*they tend to have no time limit, so what sets the price is the general level in interest rates, and the credit risk of the particular issuer
*they rank behind debt as priority in a liquidation or sale of the business, therefore they have higher credit risk

Accordingly the Vanguard Fund (VCVSX) [[#Convertible securities funds|below]], for example, is heavily weighted towards convertible bonds which are lower risk. In both cases, it underlines the need for specialist expertise to determine if the "call" option awarded to the investor (the right to convert into common stock) is correctly valued.&lt;ref name="VT3" /&gt;

==Convertible bonds==
{{Main | Convertible bonds}}
==Convertible preferred stocks==
''Convertible preferred stock'' is a stock which carries a right to convert into common stock at a certain pre-specified exercise (or strike) price. The analysis of the value of this option (effectively a long dated call option) to the investor is complex and it is a relatively risky area that requires expertise to make successful investments.&lt;ref name="VT"&gt;[http://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&amp;t=131065&amp;view=unread#p1930113 Re: Can you talk me out of Preferred Stocks?], by forum member Valuethinker, direct link to post.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike convertible bonds, ''convertible preferreds'' lack a maturity date -- unless they are redeemable and a date is specified at issue. ''Convertible preferreds'' have greater equity upside potential than ''straight preferreds,'' but normally lower starting yields and greater volatility.&lt;ref name="VG" /&gt;&lt;ref name="VT2"&gt;[http://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&amp;t=131639&amp;p=1939542#p1939177 Re: Wiki - Convertible Securities], by forum member Valuethinker, direct link to post.&lt;/ref&gt;

Basically for individual investors these things make no sense for variety of reasons, including asset location and the asymmetric call risk.
And in fund you are paying high expenses for the bond side of the risk-at least the interest rate side you can get at zero cost yourself.

Institutional investors like insurance companies use them to get around capital requirement rules--they want more equity exposure but it requires more capital than bond exposure so they "cheat" by getting their equity exposure on the bond side--this leads IMO to overpricing of converts--which allowed hedge funds to arb them for long time. But then so much money came into the market to exploit it that at one point almost all trading was done by hedge funds so no one left to exploit---the trade got overcrowded.

{{Expand article|further=no}}
'''Peer-to-peer (P2P) lending''' is a collaborative way for individual investors to participate in lending activities previously limited to banks. The information in this article is oriented toward the two major U.S. companies providing mature lending platforms, Lending Club and Prosper.

== Summary ==
Below&lt;ref&gt;Lending Club Company Website [https://www.lendingclub.com/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Prosper.com Company Website [https://www.prosper.com/]&lt;/ref&gt; summarizes some of the key aspects of P2P:
* The P2P companies screen borrowers according to stringent lending standards but can provide loans more efficiently than banks.&lt;ref&gt;Why Wells Fargo is Terrified of Peer to Peer Lending [http://www.lendingmemo.com/wells-fargo-peer-to-peer-lending/] &lt;/ref&gt;
* Accurate risk ratings with associated interest rates are posted for investors.&lt;ref&gt;How Lending Club Sets Interest Rates [https://www.lendingclub.com/public/how-we-set-interest-rates.action]&lt;/ref&gt;  
* The P2P company issues “notes” to individual investors, who can invest small amounts (as little as $25 each) to diversify across hundreds of loans, and investors are charged fees of 0.5% to 1% of the note’s value, which are deducted as principal and interest are paid.  
* Notes are available in two term periods, 36 months and 60 months.  
* P2P companies recommend holding at least 200 notes to obtain adequate diversification.  
* P2P lending is regulated at the state level, and not all states permit investment.  Some states limit investment only to Lending Club or to Prosper. Some states that prohibit investment permit purchase and sale of secondary market notes.

== Risks ==
* Default Risk – Notes issued are unsecured loans and borrowers default more frequently.
* Single Party Risk – The P2P companies own the loans, issue notes to investors, then collect and disburse payments of principal and interest. Investors do not own the underlying loans.  Therefore, in the event of a P2P company bankruptcy, the loans may be considered assets to the company’s creditors.  Accordingly, investors should carefully consider the limits to investor protections for Lending Club and Prosper before investing.
* Interest Rate Risk – When interest rates go up, the market value of existing notes will fall in price because new notes can be found at interest rates more attractive than existing (lower interest rate) notes.  
* Economic Risk – During poor economic conditions, and particularly during periods of high unemployment, default rates for notes could increase substantially.
* Liquidity Risk – Although there is a secondary market for trading P2P notes, market prices can decline significantly due to a lack of willing and available buyers.  Investors holding notes to maturity do not incur this risk.
*Prepayment Risk - Borrowers may pay back loans early, so lenders reinvesting the proceeds may obtain less favorable rates. Additionally, Lending Club investors incur a pre-payment penalty because they are still assessed the 1% fee against the balance of their "pro rata share of the payment."&lt;ref&gt;Lending Club Pre-payment Penalty to Investors [http://kb.lendingclub.com/investor/articles/Investor/What-happens-if-a-loan-is-repaid-early/?l=en_US&amp;c=Investor%3APayments_and_Fees&amp;fs=Search&amp;pn=1]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Competition from Institutions and Individuals – The available pool of attractive-rate notes has declined in recent years due to increased involvement by institutional and retail investors.  While the number of P2P loans is increasing, investor demand has been greater.  Accordingly, the average interest rate earned and number of loans available per retail investor have been declining since 2013.&lt;ref&gt;Is Peer-to-Peer Lending Over? [http://thecollegeinvestor.com/10812/is-peer-to-peer-lending-over/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.lendingclub.com/info/demand-and-credit-profile.action Lending Club Average Interest Rate]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Benefits ==
* The personal loan segment is a recently-available segment for retail investors, and provides a new way to add diversification within a fixed income portfolio.
* Investors who wish to actively manage their fixed income investments can now do so with P2P notes, even with limited capital.
* Given the small minimum investment per note ($25), a high level of loan diversification can be obtained.
* While lending standards were initially loose for P2P platforms, today they are more stringent. Additionally, P2P providers update their performance records, including loan default rates and returns, on a regular basis.
* You can filter loans by criteria that you choose, so you can “personalize” the risk characteristics for each individual loan you select. You can also select groups of notes that fit the amount of overall risk and return you prefer.
* Personal loans, while risky, provide a high return and different risks than other fixed income investments.  For example, personal loan notes are different than high yield corporate notes.
* Some investors may find it fun to select the individual loans they wish to participate in, and cherry-pick certain loans to attempt “better returns.” There are differences to be found, even between identically graded loans.

== Implications for investors ==
P2P is neither a simple nor a low cost investment, and therefore is considered inappropriate by most Boglehead investors. Bogleheads generally "take risk on the equity side" rather than with fixed income.

While the personal loan segment is a lucrative area previously limited to banks, it is not clear whether the risk adjusted return, ''after fees'', provides a better risk-adjusted return than comparable investments, such as high yield bonds. P2P should be considered a concentrated investment because of its single party risk. If selected, total investment in P2P should only be a small part of the portfolio (no more than 5%).  P2P is not tax-efficient and should be located within tax-advantaged accounts. P2P providers permit IRA accounts.

Investors who might consider P2P useful could be those already including high yield (junk) bonds in their portfolio. The reason is P2P may provide high yield investors additional diversification. P2P and high yield investors should take a corresponding reduction in their equity allocation, since both have a high correlation with equity performance.  It is suggested that a high number of P2P notes be held (700-800) for effective diversification, and that maturities for every note be for terms of 36 months, no 60-month term notes included.  A best practice for active investors is to acquire notes gradually, over a 36-month period, so a ladder with a portion maturing every month can be reinvested at current rates.

However, investors usually think of risk as the possibility that their investments could lose money.

'''Risk tolerance''' is your emotional and psychological ability to endure investment losses during large market declines without selling or undue worry, such as losing sleep. To know whether a portfolio is right for your risk tolerance, you need to be brutally honest with yourself as you try to answer the question, "Will I sell during the next [[Bear market|bear market]]?"&lt;ref name="Guide"&gt;{{cite book| title=Bogleheads' Guide To Investing| title-link=Bogleheads' Guide To Investing| author1=Taylor Larimore| author2=Mel Lindauer| author3=Michael LeBoeuf| author1-link=Taylor Larimore| author2-link=Mel Lindauer| author3-link=Michael LeBoeuf| edition=2nd| publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons| isbn=978-1-118-92128-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Risk tolerance defined==
Author [[Rick Ferri]] defines risk tolerance as:&lt;ref name="AllAbout"&gt;{{cite book| title=All About Asset Allocation| title-link=All About Asset Allocation| author=Rick Ferri| author-link=Rick Ferri| edition=2nd| publisher=McGraw-Hill| isbn=978-0-07-170078-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quotation|...a measure of the amount of price volatility and investment loss you can withstand before changing your behavior. ... An emotional decision to change or abandon an investment plan as a result of market risk ultimately increases portfolio risk and reduces return. If an investor has been in a bad market long enough to lose money, that investor doesn’t want to be out of the market when it turns around. That becomes a strategy of all risk and no return.}}

Bogleheads author [[William Bernstein]] uses ''risk tolerance'' in the sense of attitude toward risk. He suggests that investors can evaluate their risk tolerance based on how they reacted to the financial crisis during 2008 and early 2009:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=William Bernstein| author-link=William Bernstein| date=2010| title=The Investor's Manifesto| publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc| isbn=978-0-470-50514-4| pages=75-80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Sold: low risk tolerance
*Held steady: moderate risk tolerance
*Bought more: high risk tolerance
*Bought more and hoped for further declines: very high risk tolerance

You can adjust the level of risk in your portfolio by adjusting your [[asset allocation]].

Risk tolerance is a key factor for creating your [[asset allocation]] (the percentage of [[Stock basics | stocks]], [[Bond basics | bonds]], and cash or [[Money markets | cash equivalents]])&lt;ref group="note"&gt;''Fixed income'' is sometimes considered to be a combination of bonds and cash. See [[Fixed income]].&lt;/ref&gt; that will let you stay the course during inevitable market downturns.

=== Ability, willingness and need to take risk ===
Author [[Larry Swedroe]] defines asset allocation as "the process of investing assets in a manner reflecting one’s unique ability, willingness and need to take risk," with willingness referring to risk tolerance and whether you have the "fortitude and discipline" to stay with an allocation during market downturns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Larry Swedroe| author-link=Larry Swedroe| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/asset-allocation-guide-how-much-risk-should-you-take/| title=Asset Allocation Guide: How much risk should you take?| publisher=CBS Moneywatch| date=February 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Larry Swedroe| author-link=Larry Swedroe| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/asset-allocation-guide-what-is-your-risk-tolerance/| title=Asset Allocation Guide: What is your risk tolerance?| publisher=CBS Moneywatch| date=February 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Larry Swedroe| author-link=Larry Swedroe| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/asset-allocation-guide-how-much-risk-do-you-need/| title=Asset Allocation Guide: How much risk do you need?| publisher=CBS Moneywatch| date=February 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ability''' to take risk involves your investment time horizon, need for liquidity, stability of earned income, and your flexibility to adapt if you need a plan B.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;From: [[Asset allocation]]:

''Ability'' relates to an investor's ability to withstand the ups and downs of the market without getting nervous and making changes to the asset allocation. Selling in the face of a decline is about the worst thing an investor can do. Here is a table offered by author [[Larry Swedroe]], based on the 1970s bear market, showing the amount of decline for various stock/bond allocations:
{|
| style="vertical-align:top;" |
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center"
!Asset allocation %&lt;br&gt;(stock/bond)
!Exposure to&lt;br&gt;maximum loss
|-
||20/80||5%
|-
||30/70||10%
|-
||40/60||15%
|-
||50/50||20%
|-
||60/40||25%
|}
| style="vertical-align:top;" |
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center"
!Asset allocation %&lt;br&gt;(stock/bond)
!Exposure to&lt;br&gt;maximum loss
|-
||70/30||30%
|-
||80/20||35%
|-
||90/10||40%
|-
||100/0||50%
|}
|}

For example, an investor would be willing to accept a loss of 35% in the portfolio if they held an allocation of (80% stocks / 20% bonds). This table is from the 1970s; performance during other time periods will have different results. The general idea is for investors to select an asset allocation they are comfortable with.

'''Willingness''' to take risk is characterized as the eat well/sleep well trade-off. You need to take more risk for the possibility of higher expected returns (eat well). However, if you take more risk than you can handle emotionally, then it is likely that you will abandon your investment plans if your portfolio suffers big enough losses. So it is unwise for you to take so much risk that you will not sleep well during the inevitable stock market downturns.

'''Need''' to take risk is determined by the rate of return you need to achieve your financial objectives. If you decide to take more risk because of perceived "need", remember that taking extra risk could well backfire and lead to lower returns. Perhaps more importantly, once you have "won the game" by accumulating sufficient wealth, it is unwise to take more risk than you need, because the value of additional gains is much less important than the consequences of severe losses.

==Why is risk tolerance difficult to determine?==
Knowing your emotional tolerance for investment risk means knowing yourself and your unique goals and needs - and it is not easy.

Jason Zweig writes in his book on neuroscience, ''Your Money &amp; Your Brain'', that "... ''perception of investment risk'' is in constant flux, depending on your memories of past experiences, whether you are alone or part of a group, how familiar and controllable the risk feels to you, how it is described, and what mood you happen to be in at the moment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jason Zweig|title=Your Money &amp; Your Brain|date=2007|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|location=New York|page=128|isbn=978-0-7432-7668-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Investors are often asked by financial advisors to take risk tolerance questionnaires intended to help determine how aggressive or conservative their investments should be. But Jane Bryant Quinn in her book, ''How to Make Your Money Last'', calls the questionnaires "... generally bunk. You’ll lean toward more risk if stocks are going up, you’ve had a good day at the office and your shoes don’t pinch. If you’ve had a bad day because stocks went down and your unemployed child is moving in, you’ll suddenly feel more conservative."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jane Bryant Quinn|title=How to Make Your Money Last: The Indispensable Retirement Guide|date=2016|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|location=New York|page=230|isbn=978-1-4767-4376-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rick Ferri]] says some questionnaires that are worded well may be helpful, but "...overall they are not the answer to the asset allocation question. ... Finding a person’s maximum tolerance for risk takes a lot more than a questionnaire. It requires soul-searching. We tend to be brave in a bull market, and this means that it is not the ideal time to search for our risk tolerance. Soul-searching should be done in a bear market when we are not sure what is going to happen next."&lt;ref name="AllAbout" /&gt;

}}
Understanding and avoiding '''behavioral pitfalls''' has a greater final impact on your investing success than any other factor. Because emotions and subsequent behavioral pitfalls often lead to miscalculating [[risk tolerance]] and [[Asset allocation|asset allocation]], you need to be aware of behavioral pitfalls before making asset allocation decisions. 

An important pitfall to be aware of is '''loss aversion''', the emotional tendency to strongly prefer avoiding losses over acquiring gains. As an example, loss aversion implies that if we lose $100, our emotional pain is much larger than the satisfaction we would feel from receiving $100. Common indications include checking your portfolio on an almost daily basis, selling funds before you intended to lock in profits, or selling when you did not intend to in order to avoid further losses.

Selecting a mix of risky and risk-free assets (or higher-risk and lower-risk assets) is one of the most important decisions in designing a portfolio. Investors must develop a rational assessment of [[risk tolerance]] to make rational decisions about portfolio design.

Most approaches to assessing risk tolerance consider these criteria in one way or another:
*Attitude toward risk
*Investment time horizon
*Other factors that affect ability to compensate for investment losses, for example, net worth, stability of income, future liabilities, and flexibility of goals.

This article presents several frameworks to help you to assess your risk tolerance. It uses the term ''risk tolerance'' to describe both an investor's capacity to bear risk and their attitude toward risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author1=Zvi Bodie| author2=Robert C Merton| title=Finance| date=2000| publisher=Pearson| page=322| isbn=978-0-13-310897-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some authors use the term ''risk tolerance'' to describe only an investor's attitude toward risk; that is, the psychological and emotional aspects related to taking risk. To avoid confusion, the article uses "determining appropriate risk exposure" instead of "assessing risk tolerance" for frameworks that use the term ''risk tolerance'' to refer only to an investor's attitude toward risk. 

== Risk tolerance ==
{{main article|Risk tolerance}}

Risk is the uncertainty (variation) of an investment's return, which does not distinguish between a loss or a gain. However, investors usually think of risk as the possibility that their investments could lose money. 

'''Risk tolerance''' is an investor’s emotional and psychological ability to endure investment losses during large market declines without selling or undue worry, such as losing sleep. 

To know whether a portfolio is right for your risk tolerance, you need to be brutally honest with yourself as you try to answer the question, "Will I sell during the next bear market?"

Knowing your emotional tolerance for investment risk means knowing yourself and your unique goals and needs - and it is not easy. The next sections show different ways you can assess your risk tolerance.

==Boglehead's Guide To Investing==
The ''[[Bogleheads' Guide To Investing]]'' discusses determining appropriate risk exposure in the chapter on [[asset allocation]]. The context is designing an efficient portfolio and "staying the course".

The book explores four areas:
* Goals
* Time frame
* Risk tolerance
* Personal financial situation

Examples of '''goals''' are saving for a home, a child's education, or retirement.

Stocks are suitable for long '''time frames''', whereas medium and short-time frames require less risky investments. 

'''Risk tolerance''' is about the psychological and emotional ability to stick with the investment plan during large market declines. Whether or not you think you could sleep well at night (the ''sleep test'') with your current asset allocation (proportions of stocks, bonds and cash) is one indicator of risk tolerance.

Your own '''personal financial situation''' affects how much risk and what types of risk are appropriate. Stability of income and net worth affect the need to take risk. Investors with higher guaranteed retirement incomes (for example, a pension or social security) or high net worth do not need to take as much risk; that is, they have a lower requirement to invest in stocks.

The book refers to three tools, along with an investor's own experience, to help factor risk into your asset allocation:
* [[John Bogle]], founder of Vanguard, suggests that a rough "rule of thumb" to hold your '''age in bonds'''.
* Consider the '''maximum decline''' to expect with various stock/bond ratios. The original version of the book presents maximum declines in the 2000 to 2002 bear market, but the maximum declines in the 2008/2009 bear market were worse; a common rule of thumb is to be prepared for a 50% loss in the stock portion of your portfolio.
* Vanguard provides an online questionnaire and suggested asset allocations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| publisher=Vanguard| url=https://investor.vanguard.com/tools-calculators/investor-questionnaire| title=Investor Questionnaire| accessdate=July 18, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book includes a version of the questionnaire as an Appendix, but see the [https://investor.vanguard.com/tools-calculators/investor-questionnaire Vanguard website] for the latest version.

The book presents various sample portfolios based on these "stages in life":
* Young investor
* Middle-aged investor
* Investor in early retirement
* Investor in late retirement

==Larry Swedroe: ability, willingness, and need to take risk==

Bogleheads author [[Larry Swedroe]] suggests that investors evaluate their risk tolerance by considering their '''ability, willingness and need''' to take risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Larry Swedroe| author-link=Larry Swedroe| url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/asset-allocation-guide-how-much-risk-should-you-take/| title=Asset Allocation Guide: How much risk should you take?| publisher=CBS Moneywatch| date=February 3, 2014| accessdate=July 18, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Larry Swedroe| author-link=Larry Swedroe| url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/asset-allocation-guide-what-is-your-risk-tolerance/| title=Asset Allocation Guide: What is your risk tolerance?| publisher=CBS Moneywatch| date=February 12, 2014| accessdate=July 18, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Larry Swedroe| author-link=Larry Swedroe| url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/asset-allocation-guide-how-much-risk-do-you-need/| title=Asset Allocation Guide: How much risk do you need?| publisher=CBS Moneywatch| date=February 19, 2014| accessdate=July 18, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ability''' to take risk involves investment time horizon, liquidity needs, stability of earned income, and the flexibility to adapt if the portfolio does not achieve its expected returns (that is, "plan B").

'''Willingness''' to take risk is characterized as the eat well/sleep well trade-off. Taking more risk is required to enable the possibility of higher expected returns (eat well). However, if investors take more risk than they are emotionally able to handle, then it is likely that they will abandon their investment plans if their portfolios suffer sufficiently severe losses. So it is unwise for investors to take so much risk that they will be unable to sleep well during the inevitable stock market downturns.

'''Need''' to take risk is related to the investment goal. If the goal requires a higher expected return, an investor needs to take more risk with the expectation that doing so will result in a higher return. Perhaps more importantly, once an investor has "won the game" by accumulating sufficient wealth, it is unwise to take more risk than is needed, since the value of additional gains is much less important than the consequences of severe losses.

==William Bernstein==

Bogleheads author [[William Bernstein]] discusses determining appropriate risk exposure in the context of deciding on your allocation between stocks and bonds based on age and risk tolerance (attitude toward risk), at least as a starting point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=William Bernstein| author-link=William Bernstein| title=The Four Pillars of Investing| date=2010| pages=75-80| publisher=McGraw Hill| isbn=978-0-07-174705-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A very young investor has many years to take advantage of the inevitable bear markets by buying stocks at depressed prices. At the other extreme, a retired person typically is spending down savings, and therefore an extended bear market is more likely to endanger the likelihood that a stock-heavy investment portfolio will last through retirement.

In finance terms, younger investors have more [[Human capital | human capital]]; that is, their total future earnings are much larger than their investment portfolio. By contrast, a retired investor who is not working has no human capital. Human capital can be considered as a bond-like investment, so the high value of a young investor's human capital can justify a higher allocation to stocks.

Middle-aged investors fall somewhere in the middle, so perhaps might consider dividing their portfolio evenly between stocks and bonds.

Other than age, risk tolerance is the other major consideration in determining asset allocation. Bernstein uses ''risk tolerance'' in the sense of attitude toward risk. Bernstein suggests that investors can evaluate their risk tolerance based on how they reacted to the financial crisis during 2008 and early 2009:

*Sold: low risk tolerance
*Held steady: moderate risk tolerance
*Bought more: high risk tolerance
*Bought more and hoped for further declines: very high risk tolerance

Bernstein mentions age in bonds as the most common age-based rule of thumb, and suggests that investors might modify this based on risk tolerance as follows (stated in terms of percentage point increase or decrease to the stock allocation):

*Very High: +20%
*High: +10%
*Moderate: 0%
*Low: -10%
*Very Low: -20%

For example, a 50-year-old with moderate risk tolerance might hold a 50/50 stock/bond allocation (age in bonds), while a 50-year-old with very high risk tolerance might hold a 70/30 stock/bond portfolio.

Bernstein emphasizes that this is just a starting point. A very wealthy, frugal retiree might have a higher stock allocation since the chance of running out of money is low, and the investment time horizon is relatively long considering the lifetimes of their heirs and other beneficiaries. At the other end of the spectrum, a retiree whose annual living expenses consume a relatively large percentage of retirement savings might consider reducing spending and use most retirement savings to purchase a fixed annuity.

Bernstein points out that investors who have not lived through serious market declines tend to overestimate their risk tolerance. He strongly urges that investors invest conservatively until they have experienced their first bear market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=William Bernstein| author-link=William Bernstein| title=The Four Pillars of Investing| date=2010| page=124| publisher=McGraw Hill| isbn=978-0-07-174705-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; This gives them the chance to determine how they will behave as they see the value of the stock portion of their portfolio decline significantly; for example, will they have the discipline to rebalance from bonds to stocks when it seems most frightening to do so?

Bernstein presents a criterion he describes as the "equipoise point" to help with the stock/bond allocation decision. This is the point at which the pleasure of seeing the stock portion of your portfolio increase in value during a bull market just offsets the regret of not having a higher allocation to stocks. It also is the point at which the pain of stock losses during a bear market counterbalances the positive feelings provided by your bonds (which can be rebalanced into stocks at lower prices).

==Rick Ferri: lifecycle model==

Bogleheads author [[Rick Ferri]] suggests using a modified version of the age in bonds rule of thumb to help decide on the split between higher-risk and lower-risk assets, and presents asset allocation decisions in terms of a life-cycle investing framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=All About Asset Allocation| title-link=All About Asset Allocation| author=Rick Ferri| author-link=Rick Ferri| edition=2nd| publisher=McGraw Hill| pages=243-289| isbn=978-0-07-170078-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Age is an important factor in determining asset allocation. Older investors have less time to make up losses, and if still working, have fewer years to replace those losses from savings. However, applying the simple age in bonds rule of thumb is more appropriate for younger investors than for older investors.

The financial situations of younger investors are less diverse, so holding your age in bonds probably is a reasonable guideline. Financial assets are small relative to future earnings, so large stock market fluctuations will have relatively small impact on long-term wealth. A 70/30 stock/bond allocation probably is fine for most 30-year-olds.

However, there is much more diversity in the financial situations of older investors; for example, accumulated wealth, access to pension plans, family size, and so on. Although you can use age in bonds as a starting point, it is much more likely that you will need to make significant adjustments based on your personal financial situation. The concept of "asset allocation age" aims to account for these factors.

For example, investors whose wealth is large relative to spending needs can afford to take more risk, and therefore have asset allocation ages that may be higher than their chronological ages. Examples of factors to consider in determining asset allocation age are income needs, retirement needs, pensions, living expenses, bequeathing goals, passive income sources, attitude toward risk, debt, and possible inheritances.

You can also use a life-cycle investing model to help decide on how to allocate portfolio assets between higher-risk stocks and lower-risk fixed-income investments. There are four life phases to consider:

*Early savers, typically ages 20 to 39, with an appropriate allocation to stocks in the range of 60% to 80%.
*Midlife accumulators, typically ages 40 to 59, with an appropriate allocation to stocks in the range of 50% to 70%.
*Transitional retirees, typically ages 60 to 79, with an appropriate allocation to stocks in the range of 30% to 70%.
*Mature retirees, typically age 80 and up, with an appropriate allocation to stocks in the range of 20% to 60%.

Developing a good understanding of how you are likely to react to market volatility and bear markets is also critical in determining an appropriate asset allocation. Risk tolerance is defined as "a measure of the amount of price volatility and investment loss you can withstand before changing your behavior."

Although risk tolerance questionnaires can be useful as a starting point in discovering your risk tolerance, they generally are not sufficient. An asset allocation stress test is another useful tool. This involves working through a bear market scenario, month by month, using a target portfolio with real dollar amounts, and determining if you are likely to stick with a rebalancing plan as the value of the portfolio declines.

==Daniel Solin==

Daniel Solin is the author of ''[[Smartest Investment Book You'll Ever Read |The Smartest Investment Book You'll Ever Read]]'', listed in the Bogleheads [[Book recommendations and reviews]], and the subject of [https://web.archive.org/web/20210509223427/https://socialize.morningstar.com/NewSocialize/asp/FullConv.asp?forumId=F100000015&amp;lastConvSeq=54472 this Taylor's Gem].

Chapter 29 in another one of Solin's books, ''The Smartest Money Book You'll Ever Read'', is titled ''Assessing Your Risk Capacity''. Solin presents five major factors for assessing risk capacity:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Daniel R Solin| title=The Smartest Money Book You'll Ever Read| date=2012| publisher=Penguin Group| pages=138-141| isbn=978-0-399-53721-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Time horizon and liquidity needs. Longer time horizon and lower shorter-term liquidity needs increase risk capacity.
*Income and savings rate. Higher income and savings rate increase risk capacity.
*Net worth. Higher net worth increases risk capacity.
*Attitude toward risk. This is what most people refer to as ''risk tolerance'', and is the emotional component of handling losses.
*Investment knowledge. The better your understanding of portfolio theory and the risk-return trade off, the higher your risk capacity.

Solin provides a [https://www.ifa.com/SurveyNET/index.aspx Risk Capacity Survey] on his website. There is a quick survey with five questions, a 25-question "complete" survey, and a 19-question survey for [[401(k)]] plans.

{{See also|Lazy portfolios|How to build a lazy portfolio}}
'''Lazy portfolios''' are designed to perform well in most market conditions. Most contain a small number of low-cost funds that are easy to [[Rebalancing|rebalance]]. They are "lazy" in that the investor can maintain the same [[Asset allocation|asset allocation]] for an extended period of time, as they generally contain 30-40% [[Bond basics|bonds]], suitable for most pre-retirement investors.

==Canadian versions of lazy portfolios==
{{Main|finiki:Simple index portfolios}}
Below are a few examples of lazy portfolios (also called simple portfolios) that Canadian domiciled investors can use.

===Three ETFs===
The three-ETF portfolio is recommended for its simplicity and diversification.

Three-ETF portfolios consist of Canadian bonds, Canadian stocks and global stocks. Here is an example using TSX-traded ETFs from Vanguard Canada:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.financialwisdomforum.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=528931#p528931| title=Re: Simple Portfolios 2014}} Financial Wisdom Forum discussion.&lt;/ref&gt;

|}
| style="vertical-align:center" |[[File:Vanguard Canadian 3-Fund Portfolio.png]]
|}
Suitable alternatives from other vendors for two of the three ETFs in the table above are mentioned in the following pages: [[finiki:Conventional_bonds#Bond_indexes.2C_index_funds_and_ETFs|Canadian bonds]] and [[finiki:Common_shares#Mutual_funds_and_ETFs|Canadian equities]]. For global stocks, VXC currently has few competitors on the TSX. There are US-listed options for the global equity ETF, such as [{{Vf | 3141}} VT], but they include a small percentage (3-4%) of Canadian equities.

This three-fund portfolio may appear overly simplistic. Certainly the brokerage statements will look very boring. Yet this portfolio has the following characteristics:
* Exposure to over 500 Canadian bonds (terms of 1 to over 25 years; credit ratings covering the full investment grade spectrum, include government and corporate bonds)
* Exposure to nearly 250 Canadian stocks covering large-, mid- and small-capitalizations
* Exposure to thousands of large- and mid-capitalization stocks from other developed and emerging markets
* Will be very easy to rebalance 
* Weighted average management fee of 0.14% (December 2014), full MER will be a few basis points higher 
* No currency exchange fees for ETF transactions using Canadian dollars
* No currency hedging of global equities

Model portfolios maintained by [https://canadiancouchpotato.com/model-portfolios/ Canadian Couch Potato] use the same three ETFs as in the example above, with a range of fixed income from 10 to 70% of the portfolio. For equities, his Canadian:Global mix is 1:2 instead of 1:1.

===Four index funds===
If you do not want to open a brokerage account, a four index fund portfolio is available.

Simple index portfolios with four index funds include Canadian equities, US equities, EAFE Equities, and Canadian bonds. The following table is an example of a simple index portfolio built with [[finiki:Benchmarks#FPX_Indexes|"FPX Balanced"]] allocations, using four [https://www.tdcanadatrust.com/products-services/investing/mutual-funds/td-eseries-funds.jsp TD e-funds] as a example of low-cost index mutual funds:

Investors who want a simple [[asset allocation]] portfolio often use a '''two-fund portfolio'''. This consists of one equity [[index fund]] and one fixed income fund. The fund selections can vary depending on asset class (global equity or domestic equity, and bond type), and asset type ([[Mutual fund|mutual fund]], [[exchange-traded fund]] (ETF), and [[Collective investment trust|collective investment trust]] (CIT)).

==Global two-fund portfolios==
[[Rick Ferri]] has proposed a [[Lazy portfolios#Two fund portfolio|two-fund portfolio]] consisting of the following asset classes:
* A global stock market index fund/ETF
* A US intermediate term bond index fund/ETF

He suggests a US total market bond index fund/ETF for the fixed income selection. However, you can substitute a global bond index fund/ETF, a US intermediate-term bond index fund/ETF, a US intermediate-term [[treasury bond]] index fund/ETF, or a US [[Municipal bonds|municipal bond]] index fund/ETF for the fixed income allocation. You may also find that employer-provided retirement plans will use collective investment trusts as investment vehicles.

You can adjust Rick Ferri's two-fund portfolio to reflect any stock/bond allocation. The charts below show suggestions for different asset allocations.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==US-only two-fund portfolios== 
Both [[John Bogle]] and Warren Buffett have recommended portfolios for investors who want to invest in US domestic stocks and bonds. 

===John Bogle's two-fund portfolio===
[[John Bogle]] has often suggested that an investor can use one total US stock market index fund and one total US bond index fund.{{#tag:ref|In chapter 18 of ''The Little Book Of Common Sense Investing'', [[John Bogle]] wrote:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=The Little Book of Common Sense Investing| chapter=Chapter 18 - What Should I Do Now?| author=John Bogle| author-link=John Bogle| date=2007| isbn=978-0-470-10210-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Blockquote|Deep down, I remain absolutely confident that the vast majority of American families will be well served by owning their equity holdings in an all-U.S. stock-market index portfolio and holding their bonds in an all-U.S. bond-market index portfolio.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Warren Buffett's two-fund portfolio===
[[File:Buffett two-fund portfolio.png|150px|thumb|Warren Buffett's two-fund portfolio]]
Warren Buffett has suggested a two-fund portfolio consisting of a 90% allocation to an [[S&amp;P 500 index|S&amp;P 500]] index fund and a 10% allocation to [[treasury bills]].{{#tag:ref|In his 2013 letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders, Warren Buffett wrote:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/2013ltr.pdf| title=2013 Letter to the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc| author=Warren Buffett| date=February 28, 2014| accessdate=June 8, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Blockquote|What I advise here is essentially identical to certain instructions I’ve laid out in my will. One bequest provides that cash will be delivered to a trustee for my wife’s benefit. (I have to use cash for individual bequests, because all of my Berkshire shares will be fully distributed to certain philanthropic organizations over the ten years following the closing of my estate.) My advice to the trustee could not be more simple: Put 10% of the cash in short-term government bonds and 90% in a very low-cost S&amp;P 500 index fund. (I suggest Vanguard’s.) I believe the trust’s long-term results from this policy will be superior to those attained by most investors – whether pension funds, institutions or individuals – who employ high-fee managers.}}|group="note"}}

You can purchase treasury bills in a brokerage (or Treasury Direct) account, where investors tender a noncompetitive bid at auction. You can also use a treasury money market fund, or an ETF investing in 1 to 3 month bills for access to the treasury bill market. 

However, you are free to substitute an intermediate bond fund (total bond, intermediate bond, treasury bond, or municipal bond) for the t-bill allocation if desirable. Many employer-provided retirement plans offer S&amp;P 500 index funds or collective investment trusts.

You can also choose to allocate the Buffett two-fund portfolio to various stock/bond allocations.

==One balanced index fund portfolio==
You can also build a two-fund portfolio by investing in a single [[Balanced fund|balanced]] index fund. For example, [[Vanguard]], [[Fidelity]], and [[Schwab|Charles Schwab]] offer [[Target date retirement funds|target date retirement index funds]] that provide access to global stocks and intermediate bonds. Vanguard also offers global target risk balanced index funds (the [[LifeStrategy]] funds). Vanguard's funds provide access to both global stocks and global bonds. Fidelity and Schwab's target date offerings provide access to global stocks and US bonds.

Vanguard offers a US Balanced Index Fund, consisting of a 60/40 stock/bond allocation using a total US stock market index allocation and a total US bond market index allocation.

Because of [[Tax-efficient fund placement#Tax efficiency of balanced funds| tax implications]], it is often recommended that balanced index funds are used in tax-deferred and tax-free investment accounts.

Finance professor [[wikipedia:Benjamin Graham|Benjamin Graham]] (1894-1976) was the mentor of Warren Buffett, and coauthor of the influential textbook, ''Security Analysis''. His book for ordinary investors, ''[[special:BookSources/0-06-015547-7|The Intelligent Investor]]'' appeared in 1949 and went through subsequent editions up through 1973. In this book, Graham gave a widely-cited piece of advice on asset allocation. The advice can be summarized in his words: {{blockquote|&lt;nowiki&gt;[T]he&lt;/nowiki&gt; investor should never have less than 25% or more than 75% of his funds in common stocks.}}

Graham distinguished between the "enterprising" investor with "willingness to devote time an attention to securities that are more sound and more attractive than the average," that is, to beat the market, and the "defensive" investor who "will place his chief emphasis on the avoidance of serious mistakes or losses. His second aim will be freedom from effort, annoyance, and the need for making frequent decisions." In short, the Bogleheads investment philosophy is like that of Graham's "defensive" investor. 

In ''The Intelligent Investor'', Graham recommends 50/50 as the standard allocation:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Benjamin Graham| author-link=wikipedia:Benjamin Graham| editor=Jason Zweig| publisher=HarperCollins| title=The Intelligent Investor| isbn=0-06-055566-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{blockquote|We are thus led to put forward for most of our readers what may appear to be an oversimplified 50–50 formula. Under this plan the guiding rule is to maintain as nearly as practicable an equal division between bond and stock holdings. When changes in the market level have raised the common-stock component to, say, 55%, the balance would be restored by a sale of one-eleventh of the stock portfolio and the transfer of the proceeds to bonds. Conversely, a fall in the common-stock proportion to 45% would call for the use of one-eleventh of the bond fund to buy additional equities.}}

Graham says to stay within the range of 25/75 to 75/25:

{{blockquote|We have suggested as a fundamental guiding rule that the investor should never have less than 25% or more than 75% of his funds in common stocks, with a consequent inverse range of between 75% and 25% in bonds. There is an implication here that the standard division should be an equal one, or 50–50, between the two major investment mediums.}}

He is equivocal about what is now called "tactical asset allocation"; that is, varying stock exposure in response to market conditions:

{{blockquote|According to tradition the sound reason for increasing the percentage in common stocks would be the appearance of the “bargain price” levels created in a protracted bear market. Conversely, sound procedure would call for reducing the common-stock component below 50% when in the judgment of the investor the market level has become dangerously high. 

These copybook maxims have always been easy to enunciate and always difficult to follow—because they go against that very human nature which produces that excesses of bull and bear markets. ...}}

Finally, he says:

{{blockquote|&lt;nowiki&gt;[W]e&lt;/nowiki&gt; can give the investor no reliable rules by which to reduce his common-stock holdings toward the 25% minimum and rebuild them later to the 75% maximum.}}

'''Asset allocation''' means dividing an investment portfolio among different asset classes. Typically these are [[Stock basics|stocks]], [[Bond basics |bonds]], and cash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/assetallocation.htm| title=Beginners' Guide to Asset Allocation, Diversification, and Rebalancing| publisher=SEC| date=August 28, 2009| accessdate=August 9, 2023}} With modifications according to {{forum link| p=2360117| title=Re: Wiki comments requested: The importance of asset allocation}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt; Investors use three asset allocation strategies.

*'''Strategic asset allocation''' follows the [[Bogleheads® investment philosophy|Bogleheads investment philosophy]]. Strategic asset allocation is designed for the long run. The allocation may change due to life events, but it should not change due to market conditions.
*'''Tactical asset allocation'''. [[Tactical asset allocation]] shifts allocations according to economic or valuation factors. Vanguard has historically used [[Tactical asset allocation#Vanguard tactical asset allocation funds|tactical asset allocation]] for a limited number of its balanced funds.
*'''Dynamic asset allocation'''. Dynamic asset allocation calls for allocations to shift in accordance with changing future liabilities, a condition especially relevant, since changes in pension law, to institutional defined pension and institutional endowment portfolios, see [https://web.archive.org/web/20160512131137/https://www.dol.gov/ebsa/pensionreform.html The Pension Protection Act Of 2006], Department of Labor, and [https://studylib.net/doc/8651971/glide-path-alm--a-dynamic-allocation-approach-to Glide path ALM: A dynamic allocation approach to derisking]. See [https://web.archive.org/web/20190117023155/https://institutional.vanguard.com/iam/pdf/IAMIPST_122009.pdf Sample investment policy statement XYZ Company Pension Plan], Vanguard, August, 2011 for an example of an IPS employing dynamic asset allocation.&lt;/ref&gt; Determining which mix of assets to hold in a portfolio is a personal choice. The asset allocation that works best at any given stage in your life will depend largely on your need, ability and willingness take risk. These depend on the investment ''time horizon'', and on your ''financial capacity'' and ''emotional capacity'' to [[Risk tolerance|tolerate risk]] and to [[Bogleheads® investment philosophy#Stay the course|stay the course]].

While this may sound like a daunting task, there are straightforward guidelines to help you choose an appropriate asset allocation. 

How much in bonds? How much in stocks? That is the basic question of asset allocation. The more risk you can handle, the less bonds you need. When you are young, your prime earning years lie ahead, and it will be decades before you need to access the money. So higher stock allocations may be suitable, because big drops in stock prices will not hurt as long as you do not flee the market. 

[[John Bogle]] said that "as we age, we usually have (1) more wealth to protect, (2) less time to recoup severe losses, (3) greater need for income, and (4) perhaps an increased nervousness as markets jump around. All four of these factors suggest more bonds as we age."&lt;ref name="Bogle"&gt;{{cite book| author=John Bogle| author-link=John Bogle| title=Common Sense on Mutual Funds| date=2010| pages=87-88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Your asset allocation applies to your overall portfolio. You do not need to have the same asset allocation in every account you own; in fact, this may be detrimental. See [[Asset allocation in multiple accounts]] and [[Tax-efficient fund placement]] for more details.

==Strategic asset allocation==
A key reason for having an asset allocation strategy is to help you reduce the risks of volatile equity asset classes, ones that are expected to provide higher returns, by combining them with more stable fixed-income assets. These balanced portfolios help reduce volatility and down-side risk, making it easier for you to maintain a long term investment program (stay the course) without panic selling during bear markets.

With a '''strategic asset allocation''' - as explained in this article - you choose a base target allocation to a selection of different [[asset class]]es for the long run. Strategic asset allocation is used by investors following the [[Bogleheads® investment philosophy]]. You can change it due to life events, but you should not change it because of market conditions. The main asset classes are equities ([[stock]]), fixed-income ([[bond]]s) and cash. 

The goal is to select an asset allocation that lets you sleep at night, and ''avoid'' the destructive urge to sell out in a panic the next time the market plummets; then having to agonize over when it is a "good time' to get back in. This leads to selling low and buying high, the exact opposite of prudent investing.

Because the three main asset classes - equities, fixed-income, and cash equivalents - have different levels of risk and return, each will behave differently over time. Because of this, you will need to periodically [[Rebalancing|rebalance]] the allocation to these asset classes back to their target allocation to keep the portfolio's risk-return level constant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/strategicassetallocation.asp#axzz1mShM43qE| title=Strategic Asset Allocation - Definition of Strategic Asset Allocation on Investopedia| publisher=Investopedia}} A portfolio strategy that involves periodically rebalancing the portfolio in order to maintain a long-term goal for asset allocation. &lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, a '''[[tactical asset allocation]]''' shifts allocations according to economic or valuation factors. Vanguard has historically used [[Tactical asset allocation#Vanguard tactical asset allocation funds|tactical asset allocation]] for a limited number of its balanced funds. Finally, a '''dynamic asset allocation''' shifts allocations in accordance with changing future liabilities.

==Stocks and bonds==
{{Main|Stock basics | Bond basics}}

You need [[Stock basics | stocks]] to get the expected return needed to accumulate funds for retirement. Stocks provide investors with a share of the profits generated by publicly owned companies in the economy. But in exchange for the hope of high return, stocks are extremely volatile and risky. Many investors learned how risky stocks can be in 2008 when they fell 50% from their previous highs. Over time, stock prices roughly follow the trend of the economy, which is to grow. But prices can stagnate or decline for decade-long periods. This is why an allocation to bonds is a necessary part of an asset allocation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author1=Joseph Davis| author2=Daniel Piquet| url=https://personal.vanguard.com/pdf/icrrbp.pdf| title=Recessions and balanced portfolio returns| date=2011| publisher=Vanguard Institutional| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210228023517/https://personal.vanguard.com/pdf/icrrbp.pdf| archive-date=February 28, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bond basics | Bonds]] are a promise to pay back a loan of money on a pre-set schedule. Bonds do not produce the same expected high returns that stocks do, but they are much less volatile. The way to get reasonable growth without stomach-churning drops is to hold a mix of stocks and bonds.

==Impact of asset allocation on risk and return==

The only problem is that we haven't a clue what that portfolio will be.

The first table below shows the returns of various stock/bond allocations from 2000 - 2002. This period was marked by falling stock prices. The second table reflects the longer-term rewards investors hope to receive, assuming that the historical pattern of bond returns providing a premium return over inflation, and stock returns providing a premium over bond returns will be realized. The tables show why asset allocation is important. It determines future return, as well as the bear market burden of periodic losses that you will have to carry successfully to get those returns.

==Rules of thumb==
Although your exact asset allocation should depend on your goals for the money, there are some ''rules of thumb'' to help.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Rule of thumb: A principle with broad application that is not intended to be strictly accurate or reliable for every situation. (Reference: {{forum link| p=1445012| title=Wiki: Asset Allocation - Update "Age in Bonds"?}}.)&lt;/ref&gt; Any rule of thumb is only a starting point for decision making, not the end.

The most important asset allocation decision is the split between risky and non-risky assets. This is most often referred to as the stock/bond split.

[[John Bogle]] recommended "roughly your age in bonds"; for instance, at age 45, about 45% of the portfolio should be allocated to high-quality bonds. He also suggested that, during the retirement distribution phase, you should treat the value of any future pension and expected Social Security payments as a bond-like component of wealth and asset allocation.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;

{{blockquote|Long before the crash, I had fine-tuned my rule-of-thumb asset allocation model, centered at 50/50 for older investors in the distributions phase of their investment plan. Rather, I recommended -- as a crude starting point -- that an investor's bond position should be equal to his or her age. An investor age 65, then, would consider the propriety of a 65/35 bond/stock allocation. Clearly, such a rule must be adjusted to reflect an investor's objectives, risk tolerance, and overall financial position. (For example, pension and Social Security payments would be considered bondlike investments.) But the point is that as we age, we usually have (1) more wealth to protect, (2) less time to recoup severe losses, (3) greater need for income, and (4) perhaps an increased nervousness as markets jump around. All four of these factors suggest more bonds as we age.}}
"Age in bonds" and its variants, (age - 10) or (age - 20), are very general rules of thumb which you can adjust for your circumstances; a key circumstance being the presence or absence of a pension, which would change your willingness or need to take risk. Some Bogleheads do not add pensions and Social Security to their asset allocation of bond holdings. (Reference: {{forum link| p=1445023| title=Wiki: Asset Allocation - Update "Age in Bonds"?}}.)&lt;/ref&gt;

If you choose less conservative guidelines, you should understand why you feel that you have the ''need, ability, and willingness'' to take on the greater inherent risk, as explained in the next section.

All these age-based guidelines assume that your circumstances mirror the general population's. If you have a different retirement age (earlier or later), different asset levels (have saved enough to fund your retirement fully with [[Treasury Inflation Protected Security | TIPS]]), or different needs for the money (for example, college savings) you need to consider what makes your situation different, and adjust your asset allocation accordingly.

==Ability, willingness, and need==
{{Main|Risk tolerance | Risk and return: an introduction}}

Risk is the uncertainty (variation) of an investment's return. Risk tolerance is an investor’s emotional and psychological ability to endure investment losses during large market declines without selling or undue worry, such as losing sleep. To know whether an asset allocation is right for your risk tolerance, you need to be brutally honest with yourself as you try to answer the question, "Will I sell during the next bear market?". This is [[Risk_tolerance#Why_is_risk_tolerance_difficult_to_determine.3F|very hard to accurately assess]] before you have already gone through a bear market.

Author [[Larry Swedroe]] has written a multi-part guide for selecting your asset allocation; how much to invest in stocks versus bonds.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;
Four articles by Author [[Larry Swedroe]] are referenced here:
*'''Part I:''' [http://www.cbsnews.com/news/asset-allocation-guide-how-much-risk-should-you-take/ Asset Allocation Guide: How much risk should you take?], CBS Moneywatch, February 3, 2014.
*'''Part II:''' [http://www.cbsnews.com/news/asset-allocation-guide-what-is-your-risk-tolerance/ Asset Allocation Guide: What is your risk tolerance?], CBS Moneywatch, February 12, 2014.
*'''Part III:''' [http://www.cbsnews.com/news/asset-allocation-guide-how-much-risk-do-you-need/ Asset Allocation Guide: How much risk do you need?], CBS Moneywatch, February 19, 2014.
*'''Part IV:''' [http://www.cbsnews.com/news/asset-allocation-guide-dealing-with-conflicting-goals/ Asset Allocation Guide: Dealing with conflicting goals], CBS Moneywatch, February 25, 2014.

There are three additional articles in the series:
*'''Part V:''' [http://www.cbsnews.com/news/asset-allocation-guide-us-vs-international-equity/ Asset Allocation guide: U.S. vs. international equity], CBS Moneywatch, March 4, 2014. Determine the appropriate mix between domestic and international stocks. (This article is US focused.)
*'''Part VI:''' [http://www.cbsnews.com/news/asset-allocation-guide-value-vs-growth/ Asset Allocation Guide: Value vs. growth], CBS Moneywatch, March 13, 2014. Decide how much to invest between ''value'' and ''growth'' stocks. (This article is intended for experienced investors who wish to deviate from the total market approach.)
*'''Part VII:''' [http://www.cbsnews.com/news/asset-allocation-guide-small-cap-vs-large-cap/ Asset Allocation Guide: Small-cap vs. large-cap], CBS Moneywatch, March 18, 2014. Decide how much to invest between ''small-cap'' and ''large-cap'' stocks. (This article is intended for experienced investors who wish to deviate from the total market approach.)&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Ability:''' Four factors determine your ''ability'' to take risk:&lt;ref group="note"&gt;''Ability'' relates to your capacity to withstand the ups and downs of the market without getting nervous and making changes to the asset allocation. Selling in the face of a decline is about the worst thing you can do. Here is a table offered by author [[Larry Swedroe]], based on the 1970s bear market, showing the amount of decline for various stock/bond allocations:
{|
| style="vertical-align:top;" |
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center"
!Asset allocation %&lt;br&gt;(stock/bond)
!Exposure to&lt;br&gt;maximum loss
|-
||20/80||5%
|-
||30/70||10%
|-
||40/60||15%
|-
||50/50||20%
|-
||60/40||25%
|}
| style="vertical-align:top;" |
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center"
!Asset allocation %&lt;br&gt;(stock/bond)
!Exposure to&lt;br&gt;maximum loss
|-
||70/30||30%
|-
||80/20||35%
|-
||90/10||40%
|-
||100/0||50%
|}
|}

For example, an investor would be willing to accept a loss of 35% in the portfolio if they held an allocation of (80% stocks / 20% bonds). This table is from the 1970s; performance during other time periods will have different results. The general idea is for investors to select an asset allocation they are comfortable with.

*'''Willingness:''' Define your ''willingness'' to take risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Larry Swedroe| author-link=Larry Swedroe| url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/asset-allocation-guide-what-is-your-risk-tolerance/| title=Asset Allocation Guide: What is your risk tolerance?| publisher=CBS Moneywatch| date=February 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Do you have the fortitude and discipline to stick with your predetermined investment strategy when the going gets rough?

*'''Need:''' The ''need'' to take risk is determined by the rate of return required to achieve financial objectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Larry Swedroe| author-link=Larry Swedroe| url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/asset-allocation-guide-how-much-risk-do-you-need/| title=Asset Allocation Guide: How much risk do you need?| publisher=CBS Moneywatch| date=February 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The greater the rate of return needed to achieve your financial objective, the more risks with equities you need to take. A critical part of the process is differentiating between real needs and desires. If you decide to take more risk because of perceived "need", keep in mind that taking extra risk could well backfire and lead to lower returns.

*How you should handle difficult choices among ''ability'', ''willingness'', and ''need'' to take risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Larry Swedroe| author-link=Larry Swedroe| url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/asset-allocation-guide-dealing-with-conflicting-goals/| title=Asset Allocation Guide: Dealing with conflicting goals| publisher=CBS Moneywatch| date=February 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, [[Larry Swedroe]] suggests choosing the lowest equity allocation from among ''ability'', ''willingness'', and ''need'' to take risk (and adjusting goals as needed).&lt;ref name="BH"&gt;{{Forum link|p=6032412|title=Re: Clarification of the 'need, ability, and willingness' framework}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case where the ''ability'' is greater than the ''need'' to take risk, it is possible to choose an equity allocation in the range between these two factors, based on your ''willingness'' to take risk.&lt;ref name="BH" /&gt;

==Rebalancing==
{{Main|Rebalancing}}
Over time your asset allocation may change from its original position as a result of the difference in returns from the various asset classes. [[Rebalancing]] is the act of bringing the asset allocation in line with current [[investment policy statement|investment policy]]. A typical recommendation is that you should review the portfolio asset allocation once a year, and if necessary, rebalance as specified in the investment policy. Rebalancing is often the most difficult part because it is counterintuitive, it requires you to sell a portion of an investment that went up, and buy more of what went down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Rick Ferri| author-link=Rick Ferri| title=All About Asset Allocation: The Easy Way to Get Started|edition=Second|date=2010|page=x|publisher=McGraw-Hill, Inc|isbn=978-0071700788}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Asset allocation portfolios==
{{Main|Lazy portfolios}}
Strategic asset allocation strategies range from simple to complex. [[Lazy portfolios]] are designed to perform well in most market conditions. Most contain a small number of low-cost funds that are easy to rebalance. They are "lazy" in that you can maintain the same asset allocation for an extended period of time, suitable for most pre-retirement investors.

*[[John Bogle]] was a proponent of simple asset allocation portfolios. He frequently advised that most investors should allocate investment portfolios using two asset class index funds: a U.S. total market stock index fund, and a U.S. total bond market index fund.&lt;ref&gt;John Bogle argues this position in his classic text, {{cite book| title=Common Sense on Mutual Funds| isbn=978-0470138137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*A widely held portfolio among Bogleheads Forum members is the [[three fund portfolio]]. This allocates investments among a U.S. Total market stock market portfolio; a Total International stock market portfolio, and a U.S Total bond market portfolio. Members frequently expand this portfolio to include a fourth asset class, [[Treasury Inflation Protected Securities|U.S. inflation-indexed bonds]].

*Some strategic asset allocation funds add additional asset classes or sub-asset classes to the asset mix. For equity investments these additions can include [[Value tilting - stock|value stock]] funds, real estate funds ([[Real estate investment trust|U.S.]] and [[International REITs|international]]), [[gold]], and [[Commodities|commodity]] futures funds. Additional fixed income asset classes include [[High yield bonds|U.S high yield bond]] funds, international [[Developed market bonds|developed market bond]] funds, and [[Emerging market bonds|emerging market bond]] funds. Depending on your risk tolerance preferences or tax situation, you might restrict your bond market allocations to [[treasury bonds|U.S treasury bonds]] or investment grade [[municipal bonds]].

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Funds that implement target asset allocations==
{{Main|Balanced fund|Target date funds}}
An asset-allocation fund or a balanced fund is a [[mutual fund]] that holds multiple [[Asset class | asset classes]]. Typically these funds hold [[Stock basics|stocks]], [[Bond basics|bonds]], and in some instances, [[Money markets|cash]]. Although many balanced funds maintain a fixed [[ asset allocation]], some have a variable allocation policy, changing asset weightings according to market conditions. 

[[Target date funds]] are balanced funds that gradually change asset class weightings according to a presumed changing need for a lower risk profile over time. These funds attempt to provide investors portfolios that account for the holder's age, risk appetite, and investment objectives, with an appropriate allocation of asset classes. However, [[Balanced fund#Arguments against balanced funds|critics of this approach]] point out that arriving at a standardized solution for allocating portfolio assets is problematic because individual investors require individual solutions.

==Choices for equity==
{{See also|Variations on Bogleheads® investing}}
For equity allocation, you need to choose the split between domestic ("US") and international (excluding US or "ex-US") stocks.

You may decide to select a set portion of regional stock markets, for example: North American markets, European markets, Asian markets, and Emerging markets.

If you are unsure of the US and ex-US allocation split (the sum representing the total amount of stocks), you can copy the allocations used by a balanced ("all-in-one") or target date fund. Those funds are created by experienced professionals who have done all the hard work before-hand. An example is shown in the wiki [[Approximating Vanguard target date funds#Example of approximating a Vanguard target date fund |here]].

At the same time, you need to decide whether to follow the full market or to select a portion (large-cap, mid-cap or small-cap); or to tilt in style (value, blend or growth); favor [[REIT]]s, or to allocate among sectors.&lt;ref group="note"&gt; A common reasons for sector allocation is: You may be employed in a segment of the economy with low job security and so want to reduce or eliminate exposure to that sector in your investment portfolio.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Choices for bonds==
Bogleheads like to own bond funds [[Individual Bonds vs a Bond Fund | instead of individual bonds]] for convenience and diversification. Using individual [[Corporate bonds|corporate]] or [[Municipal bonds|municipal]] bonds require a very large holding in order to achieve the broad diversification and increased safety of a bond fund. The high number of different bonds in bond funds let you ignore the risk of any one bond defaulting. You can manage [[Bond basics#Interest rate risk|Interest rate risk]] if you select funds with short and intermediate-term [[Bonds: advanced topics#Duration |duration]], and you can manage [[Bond basics#Credit_risk| default risk]] by selecting funds with high credit ratings. The central idea here is that your bond holdings are for safety; that is, to reduce violent up and down swings in your overall portfolio value. Bogleheads tend to take risks on the equity side, not the bond side.

Bogleheads typically divide bond allocations between just two categories: [[Nominal bond | nominal bonds]] such as the [{{Vf | 0084}} Vanguard Total Bond Market Fund], and U.S. Treasury Inflation Protected Securities ([[Treasury Inflation Protected Security |TIPS]]) such as the [{{Vf | 0119}} Vanguard Inflation Protected Securities Fund]. A TIPS fund gives you additional diversification, as well as inflation protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=The Bogleheads' Guide To Investing| title-link=Bogleheads' Guide To Investing| isbn=978-1-118-92128-9| publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.| date=2007| p=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[I Savings Bonds | I-Bonds]] are also an attractive alternative to TIPS. The U.S. Treasury sells these directly to investors. They do not need to be held in a tax-protected account; and they accrue interest tax-deferred for up to 30 years. There are annual limits on how much you can buy in I-bonds.

It consists of global stocks and bonds, held in [[Free-float methodology|free-float]] market proportions.&lt;ref name=RISMAT-7&gt;{{Cite web|author=William F. Sharpe|title=Retirement Income Scenario Matrices 7. The Market Portfolio|url=https://web.stanford.edu/~wfsharpe/RISMAT/RISMAT-7.pdf|publisher=Stanford University (Creative Commons)|accessdate=June 16, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Components ==

There is currently no single retail fund that implements a World Bond/Stock (WBS) portfolio in the way described by Sharpe. To address this, he has suggested a four-fund proxy&lt;ref name=RISMAT-7/&gt;&lt;ref name=4-Fund-Proxy&gt;{{Cite web|author=William F. Sharpe|title=The Four-fund Proxy for the World Bond Stock Fund|url=https://retirementincomeanalysis.blogspot.com/2019/08/the-four-fund-proxy-for-wold-bond-stock.html|date=August 2019|accessdate=June 16, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also a two-fund proxy&lt;ref name=2-Fund-Proxy&gt;{{Cite web|author=William F. Sharpe|title=A Two-fund Proxy for the World Bond Stock Fund|url=https://retirementincomeanalysis.blogspot.com/2019/09/a-two-fund-proxy-for-world-bond-stock.html|date=September 2019|accessdate=June 16, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt; for WBS consisting of established Vanguard index funds.

A four-fund proxy for WBS consists of:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Component fund !! Asset class
|-
| VTSAX (or VTI) || US stocks
|-
| VTIAX (or VXUS) || Ex-US stocks
|-
| VBTLX (or BND) || USD bonds
|-
| VTABX (or BNDX)  || Ex-USD bonds
|-
|}

A two-fund proxy for WBS consists of:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Component fund !! Asset class
|-
| VT || Global stocks
|-
| BNDW || Global bonds
|-
|}

Of course, it is also possible to implement something similar with non-Vanguard funds.

== Allocations ==

The index funds used by the WBS proxies described above are held in proportion to their free-float market capitalization. That requires calculating the market capitalization of the index that each fund tracks. This is done by taking each index's market capitalization listed in its most recent factsheet, and then projecting that forward by the change in the fund's adjusted closing prices between the factsheet's publishing date and the current date.

&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{IndexMarketCap}_\mathrm{Current} = \mathrm{IndexMarketCap}_\mathrm{Factsheet} \times \frac{\mathrm{TrackingFundPrice}_\mathrm{Current}}{\mathrm{TrackingFundPrice}_{\mathrm{FactsheetDate}}}
&lt;/math&gt;

Note: VBTLX/BND, VTABX/BNDX, and BNDW track Bloomberg indices which do not publish their market capitalization numbers.  Sharpe has suggested that FTSE indexes (for example, WorldBIG) could substitute.&lt;ref name=RISMAT-7/&gt;&lt;ref name=4-Fund-Proxy/&gt;

=== Example ===

Here is an example of the allocation calculations as of June 15, 2025:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Component fund
! Asset class
! Tracked index
! Index factsheet market cap
! Index factsheet date
! Adjusted closing price on factsheet date

| FTSE Global All Cap Index
| $90.42T
| May 30, 2025
| $123.37
| $124.95
| $91.58T
(= $90.42T * $124.95 / $123.37)
| 62.43%
(= $91.58T / ($55.08T + $91.58T))
|-
| BNDW
| Global bonds
| FTSE WorldBIG (substitute for Bloomberg index)
| $54.93T
| May 31, 2025
| $68.58
| $68.77
| $55.08T
(= $54.93T * $68.77 / $68.58)
| 37.57%
(= $55.08T / ($55.08T + $91.58T))
|-
|}

|}

Note: The total allocation to VTI and VXUS in the four-fund proxy might not precisely equal the VT allocation in the two-fund proxy. This is because VTI tracks a [[CRSP equity indexes|CRSP]] index which differs slightly from the [[FTSE Group|FTSE]] index that VT tracks.

== Rebalancing ==
{{See also|Rebalancing}}

The World Bond/Stock (WBS) portfolio holds each individual asset (that is, individual stock or bond) in proportion to its free-float market capitalization. Equivalently, it holds the same fraction of each asset’s free-float shares outstanding. That is, '''(shares held) / (free-float shares outstanding)''' is the same for every individual asset.

Framing WBS this way shows that rebalancing is needed only when an asset’s free-float supply changes the fraction of shares held (for example, new issuances, buybacks, or redemptions).

Conversely, events like price changes and dividend payments do ''not'' require rebalancing since they leave the fraction of shares held unchanged. As a result, WBS requires less frequent rebalancing than traditional fixed-weight portfolios (for example, a 60/40 stock/bond mix), which must rebalance whenever asset prices change.

If WBS assets are held through a ''single'' index fund, the fund handles rebalancing internally. But if assets are split across ''multiple funds'' (for example, stocks in VT and bonds in BNDW), their underlying free-float supply may change at different rates. This causes the share fractions held by the different funds to drift apart, requiring occasional manual rebalancing between the funds to realign them.

== Adjusting for personal circumstances ==

The World Bond/Stock portfolio mirrors the holdings of the average publicly invested portfolio, thereby taking on average investment risk and producing average return.&lt;ref name=Arithmetic&gt;{{Cite web|author=William F. Sharpe|title=The Arithmetic of Active Management|url=https://web.stanford.edu/~wfsharpe/art/active/active.htm|publisher=Association for Investment Management and Research|date=February 1991|accessdate=June 16, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt; This makes it a good default strategy.

Nevertheless, Sharpe notes that someone may justifiably deviate from this strategy to adjust for personal circumstances.&lt;ref name=Adjust&gt;{{Cite web|author=Charles Rotblut, William F. Sharpe|title=Allocate by Market Weight (And Adjust for Personal Circumstances)|url=https://www.aaii.com/files/PDF/9314_allocate-by-market-weight-and-adjust-for-personal-circumstances.pdf|publisher=American Association of Individual Investors|accessdate=June 16, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Adjustments discussed by Sharpe include:
* '''Adding a riskless asset.'''  For example, using certain inflation-adjusted investments (like [[Treasury Inflation Protected Security|TIPS]]) to cover a portion of real expenses.&lt;ref name=RISMAT-6&gt;{{Cite web|author=William F. Sharpe|title=Retirement Income Analysis with scenario matrices, Chapter 6. Inflation-Protected Investments|url=https://web.stanford.edu/~wfsharpe/RISMAT/RISMAT-6.pdf|publisher=Stanford University (Creative Commons)|accessdate=June 16, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Tilting asset allocations.''' For example, adjusting the stock/bond ratio to account for factors like [[Human capital|human capital]].&lt;ref name=Adjust/&gt;

=== Tilting using adaptive asset allocation ===

Sharpe proposes Adaptive Asset Allocation Policies, which allow asset class tilting while still remaining anchored to the dynamics of the WBS portfolio.&lt;ref name=AAAP&gt;{{Cite web|author=William F. Sharpe|title=Adaptive Asset Allocation Policies |url=https://web.stanford.edu/~wfsharpe/aaap/wfsaaap.pdf|publisher=Stanford University|accessdate=June 16, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt; This enables customization while continuously adapting to changes in the relative risk between asset classes.

It works as follows. Start with a desired initial allocation. Then update each asset class weight using:

&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{UpdatedWeight} = 
\mathrm{CurrentMarketWeight} \times
\frac{\mathrm{InitialDesiredWeight}}{\mathrm{InitialMarketWeight}}
&lt;/math&gt;

Finally, normalize the updated weights to get the new allocation.  For example:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Component fund
! Asset class
! Initial desired weight
! Initial market weight
! Current market weight
! Updated weight
! Normalized allocation
|-
| VT
| Global stocks
| 80%
| 60%
| 55%
| 73.33%
(= 55% * 80/60)
| 76.52%
(= 73.33 / (73.33 + 22.50))
|-
| BNDW
| Global bonds
| 20%
| 40%
| 45%
| 22.50%
(=45% * 20/40)
| 23.48%
(= 22.50 / (73.33 + 22.50))
|-

The concept of portfolio '''value tilting''' is intended for &lt;u&gt;advanced investors&lt;/u&gt;. Tilting is not recommended for new investors, as it ''intentionally deviates'' from investing in the total market- a Bogleheads' approach to managing your portfolio.
}}

==Background==
{{Quote
|quote = '''John Bogle on tilting''':&lt;br&gt;"Impressed both by the long-term performance (and recent performance) of value stocks and small-cap stocks, some investors hold the all-market (or S&amp;P 500) index fund as the core, and add a value index fund and a small-cap index fund as satellites. I'm skeptical that any kind of superior performance will endure forever. (Nothing does!) But if you disagree, it would not be unreasonable to hold, say, 85 percent in the core, another 10 percent in value, and another 5 percent in small cap. But doing so increases the risk that your return will fall short of the market's return, so don't push too far."

Financial experts&lt;ref&gt;See John Bogle, [https://personal.vanguard.com/bogle_site/sp20020626.html The Telltale Chart]&lt;/ref&gt; often recommend that investors should use index mutual funds to invest in entire markets, or, invest in funds that approximate the total market. Other portfolio theorists advise holding portfolios that tilt toward small and value stocks.&lt;ref&gt;Eugene Fama Jr., [http://www.dfaus.com/2009/05/the-new-indexing.html The New Indexing], July 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Truman A. Clark, [http://www.dfaus.com/2009/05/the-dimensions-of-stock-returns-2007.html The Dimensions of Stock Returns], September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; 
One popular way to analyze the stock market is to subdivide it into 3 levels of [[Market Capitalization | market capitalization]] and 3 [[Stock Basics#Style | styles]], resulting in a 3 x 3 "style" box. As defined in the style box for VTSMX&lt;ref&gt;[{{Vf | 0085}} Vanguard's Total Stock Market Index Fund (VTSMX)] approximates the total market by investing in over 3,000 stocks, which is representative of the whole U.S. market&lt;/ref&gt;, the majority of the US Market (the Total Stock Market or "TSM") is held in large caps. Therefore, this fund (representing the US Market, or the "Market") is defined as a "''cap weighted''" market.
&lt;center&gt;

The intent is that these distribution percentages, by definition, accurately represent the composition of the entire market. Gain and loss over time represents the movement of the market as a whole.

If you invest $1.00 in a total market index fund, each stock receives the same amount of your dollar in proportion to its cap weight. The largest stock gets 100 times the amount of a company 100th its size. Therefore, no company gets more or less than that determined by its market capitalization.

==Tilting==
Tilting is defined as any deviation (change) from the Total Stock Market distribution percentages as previously defined.

Historically, value stocks and small stocks have provided higher returns than large blend and growth stocks (in both domestic and foreign markets). The theoretical basis posited for these higher returns states that small stocks and value stocks are riskier than large and growth stocks, and that the higher returns compensate investors for higher risk.&lt;ref&gt; Rolf W. Banz, "The Relationship Between Return and Market Value of Common Stocks," Journal of Financial Economics, 9 (1981), pp. 3-18 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Davis, James L., [[Eugene F. Fama]] and [[Kenneth R. French]], "Characteristics, Covariances, and Average Returns: 1929-1997" (February 1999). Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP) Working Paper No. 471. Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=98678 or DOI: 10.2139/ssrn.98678 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Eugene F. Fama]] and [[Kenneth R. French]], "Value Versus Growth: The International Evidence" (August 1997). Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=2358 or DOI: 10.2139/ssrn.2358 &lt;/ref&gt; Based on theory and past performance, some investors choose to add additional value and small stocks to their portfolios. Many investors who tilt employ what is termed a 4x25 allocation consisting of equal parts of 25% large blend; 25% large value; 25% small blend; and 25% small value. Tilters employ blend indexes for growth stock exposure in response to the long term performance of small cap growth stocks.&lt;ref&gt; [[William Bernstein]], [http://www.efficientfrontier.com/ef/499/scg.htm Small Cap Growth Indexing and the Multifactor Threestep],''Efficient Frontier'', April, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; [[William Bernstein]], [http://www.efficientfrontier.com/ef/701/sg.htm The Small-Growth Indexing Anomaly], ''Efficient Frontier'', Summer 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Other tilters, valuing greater portfolio simplicity, overweight small value stocks by adding a small value fund to the market portfolio.&lt;ref&gt;Sample portfolios using small cap tilts are included in [[Lazy Portfolios]]:
*[[Lazy Portfolios#Bill Schultheis's "Coffeehouse" Portfolio]]
*[[Lazy Portfolios#William Bernstein's "Coward's" Portfolio]]
*[[Lazy Portfolios#Frank Armstrong's "Ideal Index" Portfolio]]&lt;/ref&gt; Overweight means increasing your holdings to more than is naturally in the market profile. 

As an example, the Small cap styles represent 9% (3 + 3 + 3) of the total market. ''Tilting to Small'' means overweighting your portfolio to hold more than 9% of Small cap stocks.

==Considerations==
===Asset allocation===
Bogleheads author [[Larry Swedroe]] suggests that tilting to stocks with higher expected returns, such as small-cap and value, can allow the investor reduce overall equity exposure while maintaining the same expected return for the portfolio. Holding a smaller allocation to stocks and a larger allocation to bonds reduces "fat tail" risk; i.e., the risk of unexpected events that have a large negative impact on the overall stock market.

===Duration===
Tilted portfolios require long holding periods as the market, value, and size factor returns often rotate over time.&lt;ref&gt; [[William Bernstein]], [http://www.efficientfrontier.com/ef/700/factors.htm Factor Rotation], ''Efficient Frontier'', Summer 2000. &lt;/ref&gt;
===Investor behavior===
The investor's behavior during bear and bull markets can influence results. An investor who tilts must be able to hold to the allocation during periods when the tilted equity portfolio underperforms the market portfolio. An investor should also resist the temptation to engage in "performance chasing", that is buying or selling a size or style tilt based on recent performance.
===Rate of return===
Although small-cap and value stocks may have higher expected returns than large-cap and growth stocks, investors should recognize that the record of realized returns does not assure a similar pattern in the future. The timing and magnitude of the small and value premiums will always be uncertain, i.e. past performance does not predict future performance.

===Taxes===
In a taxable account, value funds have an additional tax cost, because they tend to have higher dividend yields. Rebalancing between multiple funds may also add to the tax cost if the rebalancing cannot be done with new money. Small-cap and value index funds are more likely to realize capital gains, although tax-managed funds and [[ETFs]] reduce this tax effect. Much of the extra tax cost can be avoided by [[Principles of Tax-Efficient Fund Placement|tax-efficient fund placement]] for an investor with both tax-advantaged and taxable accounts if the value funds can all be held in a tax-advantaged account.

Over time the meaning has been extended.&lt;/ref&gt; DCA is an alternative to lump sum investing, which is to make the entire investment immediately. It is a technique to overcome fear in investing by mitigating the risk of loss over the short term. 

For any sequence of constant-dollar purchases&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Equal parts means that the amount (dollars) is constant, hence the term "constant-dollar".&lt;/ref&gt; of an asset whose price fluctuates, you would purchase more shares when prices are lower than when prices are high.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dollarcostaveraging.asp| title=Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) Explained With Examples and Considerations| publisher=Investopedia| date=April 26, 2023| accessdate=August 12, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the average cost per share will be lower than the average price per share over the same period.

This consequence of DCA provides an argument to persuade investors to make systematic, periodic fixed dollar amount investments regardless of market prices. 

The term DCA is also encompasses similar investment concepts such as [[#Automatic investment|periodic automatic investment]] (used almost universally by individual investors to fund retirement accounts out of earned income).

A variant on the idea of DCA is "[[#Reverse dollar cost averaging|reverse dollar-cost averaging]]", which relates to periodic automatic withdrawals made during retirement.&lt;ref name="Hebeler"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.analyzenow.com/Articles/Investments/Investment%20Articles/ReverseDollarCostAvg1-1-01.pdf| title=Reverse Dollar Cost Averaging| author=Henry K. Hebeler| date=January 2, 2001| accessdate=August 12, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, [[value averaging]] closely resembles dollar-cost averaging but differs in that the investor selects a target growth rate or amount on their asset base or portfolio each period, and then adjusts the next period's contribution according to the relative gain or shortfall made on the original asset base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/value_averaging.asp| title=Value Averaging: What it Means, Examples| publisher=Investopedia| date=May 5, 2022| accessdate=August 12, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dollar-cost averaging versus lump sum==
When you are ready to invest money, a common question is whether you should invest it as a '''lump sum''' or '''dollar-cost average (DCA)''' by splitting your investment across several payments. The answer depends on the degree to which you are willing to accept lower expected returns in exchange for lower potential losses (aversion to possible loss).

In most cases, you are moving your money from cash (or the equivalent, a low-yielding [[Money markets | money market]]) to some mix of [[Stock basics | stocks]] and [[Bond basics | bonds]]. The expected return of both stocks and bonds is higher than cash. However, their volatility is higher as well. The risk is that just after making your investment, the market could crash, causing your investment to quickly lose value due to the unfortunate timing of your purchase. 

Of course, according to [[Bogleheads® investment philosophy | Bogleheads investment philosophy]], you should only be investing in the first place into a diversified asset allocation. Also, you should only be holding volatile funds like stocks and bonds if your investing horizon is long enough to ride out their volatility.

Lump sum investing will always carry a higher expected return, because it immediately moves your funds from asset classes with lower expected returns to ones with higher expected returns. Note that higher ''expected'' returns do not guarantee that your ''actual'' returns will be higher. A Vanguard study&lt;ref name=":0"&gt; {{cite web| url=https://pressroom.vanguard.com/nonindexed/7.23.2012_Dollar-cost_Averaging.pdf| title=Dollar-cost averaging just means taking risk later| publisher=Vanguard| date=July 23, 2012| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121107195530/https://pressroom.vanguard.com/nonindexed/7.23.2012_Dollar-cost_Averaging.pdf| archive-date=November 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; concluded that lump sum investing has historically produced higher returns two thirds of the time when the DCA plan was implemented over 12 months. Lump sum was also more favorable when the analysis used risk-adjusted returns.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; DCA plans with longer timelines have worse results. A related Vanguard publication notes that if a DCA plan was implemented over 36 months, lump sum investing produced higher returns approximately 92% of the time. In addition, over a 12-month period, the maximum downside potential of DCA was higher than the maximum upside potential.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Berkowitz|first=Daniel B.|date=2016|title=Invest now or temporarily hold your cash?|url=https://www.optimizedportfolio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/vanguard-invest-now-or-temporarily-hold-your-cash.pdf|publisher=Vanguard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some investors are willing to sacrifice some expected return in order to reduce their potential loss, knowing that higher expected return come with higher potential loss. For those investors, dollar-cost averaging is superior because it reduces the chances of investing all the money just prior to a market drop. Instead, as the price fluctuates each month, you will buy more shares when the price is low and less when it is high. In such volatile markets your actual return can be higher than the return of the lumpsum which will match the return of the assets. 

Many new investors are more interested in minimizing their potential loss, and it is important that an ill-timed market drop does not scare them off from investing in the future. Many experienced investors are more interested in maximizing their expected returns. You can also decide to split the difference, where you invest half immediately and the other half over 6 or so months.

=== Costs===

Most no-load mutual funds allow small, regular investments with no fees. However, most investors pay a commission to purchase a load-fund or an [[Exchange-traded fund]] (ETF). Depending on the size of the commission and the investment, dollar-cost averaging into a load-fund or an ETF could be far more expensive than purchasing as a lump sum. For ETFs, the [[bid/ask spread]] is the same between DCA and lump sum.

==Automatic investment==

Most investors make regular contributions through their [[401(k)]] plans or by having a set amount auto-deducted from their bank account into an [[IRA]] or taxable account. When this money is automatically invested, it has the same benefit of dollar-cost averaging that you buy more shares when prices are low and less when they are high. However, this form of investing is not dollar-cost averaging. It is called '''periodic investing'''. The difference is that periodic investing is maximizing expected return, because you are investing the money as soon as you have it. DCA applies when you have the money to invest, but delay doing so.

===Switching to a more conservative portfolio===

Some investors who are new to a [[Bogleheads® investment philosophy | Bogleheads investment philosophy]] may find their portfolios contain too much equity. Even worse, some investors have a large portion of their net worth held in a single stock, such as through an employee purchase plan. They generally want to sell some of their equities and buy bonds. In these cases where an investor wants to move from high risk and volatility assets to lower risk and volatility assets, a lump sum transaction makes more sense than DCA. That is because lump sum both immediately moves to the expected return and volatility the investor wants, while also minimizing potential regret.

==Reverse dollar-cost averaging==

Investors who regularly add to their investment portfolios with '''periodic investing''' purchase more shares when prices are low and less shares when prices are high. Author Henry K. Hebeler&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Henry K. Hebeler |title=Getting Started in A Financially Secure Retirement| publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons| date=April 27, 2007| isbn=978-0-470-11778-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; points out that investors ''' periodically distributing''' retirement income from their portfolios experience the reverse action, redeeming more shares when prices are low and less shares when prices are high. Hebeler terms this process, "reverse dollar-cost averaging" with results that should, on average, reduce expected returns.

Examining rolling 20 year investment periods from 1927 to 1995 for a portfolio consisting of 50% large cap stocks ([[S&amp;P 500 index|S&amp;P 500]]); 40% long term [[Corporate bonds|corporate bonds]]; and 10% [[Treasury bill|treasury bills]], with expense loadings of 1.50% for stocks; 0.50% for bonds; and 0.30% for cash), Hebeler provides average real returns for four scenarios: the portfolio; the accumulating investor (saving for retirement); the distributing investor (withdrawal during retirement); as well as the results of 80% percentile returns (reflecting desires for portfolio survivability for retirement distributions). Indexing the portfolios would add 0.70% to each portfolio's returns simply due to reduced costs.&lt;ref name="Hebeler" /&gt;

''Value Averaging'' is for experienced investors. You may need to hold funds in reserve, such as a money market fund, to cover additional contributions needed during market declines. Managing this cash flow adds further complications. Please ask in the forum for assistance.
}}
'''{{PAGENAME}}''' uses a formula, shown below, to guide how much you invest into a given investment at a specific time. The emphasis is on establishing a portfolio target value or "value path". Value averaging aims to periodically increase the investment's value by this calculated amount.

Whenever a portfolio under-performs, you will have to make a larger investment to make up for the under-performance. The converse is also true, so that if the portfolio outperforms its targeted rate of return, then then you do not purchase more shares. You can think of value averaging as a combination of [[dollar cost averaging]] and portfolio [[rebalancing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.valueaveraging.ca/research/The%20Value%20Averaging%20Investment%20Strategy.pdf| author=Bruce Ramsey| title=The Value Averaging Investment Strategy| publisher=VA Investment Software| accessdate=August 13, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former Harvard professor Michael E. Edelson introduced value averaging in his book ''Value Averaging'', published by Wiley in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Michael E. Edelson| title=
Value Averaging: The Safe and Easy Strategy for Higher Investment Returns| publisher=Wiley| date=2006| isbn=978-0-470-04977-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==How value averaging works==
The key idea is to create a ''Value Path'' which will describe the investment’s target level for each time period. You must simply make the proper investment or sale at each period so that the holdings are equal to the target value. 

The variables and the formula for the Value Path are as follows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.sigmainvesting.com/advanced-investing-topics/value-averaging| title=Value Averaging| publisher=Sigma Investing| date=2007| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210508133532/http://www.sigmainvesting.com/advanced-investing-topics/value-averaging| archive-date=May 8, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Variables: 
*'''t''' =	Time period (can be months, quarters, years, etc.)
*'''V&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;''' =	Target value of investment at time period '''t'''
*'''C''' =	Target initial contribution per period
*'''r''' =	Expected rate of growth per period of investment
*'''g''' =	Expected rate of growth per period of contribution
*'''R''' =	Average rate of growth of investment and contribution

To simplify the calculation, we will set '''R''' = ('''r''' + '''g''') / 2. Thus, '''R''' is just an average of the growth rates of the investment and the contribution amount.

Now, the formula for the Value Path:
:'''V&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;''' = '''C''' * '''t''' * (1 + '''R''')'''&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;'''

Now, you can simply use this formula to generate a Value Path for your investment. There are two different approaches for this depending on your needs. If you have a specific goal in mind, for example you need $100,000 in 10 years for your son’s college expenses, you can start with the final value of the Value Path and use that to determine the required value of your initial contribution ('''C'''). So, for our example, if we were working with monthly time periods, we would want '''V&lt;sub&gt;120&lt;/sub&gt;''' = 100,000. Then, we solve '''V&lt;sub&gt;120&lt;/sub&gt;''' = '''C''' * 120 * (1 + '''R''')'''&lt;sup&gt;120&lt;/sup&gt;'''.

On the other hand, if you have no specific savings goal but do know the amount of initial contribution that you are comfortable with, then you can plug in a value of '''C''' and solve for all the values of '''V&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'''.

It is a good idea to use a spreadsheet to create your Value Paths and track your progress. An important thing to remember about the Value Path is that you should remain flexible and update your Value Path if circumstances change. For instance, if the rate of growth for your investment or your ability to contribute changes, you should re-calculate the Value Path from your current point.

The Value Path formula depends heavily on your estimates of the rate of growth of the investment asset. Because of this, it is very important to provide as realistic rates as possible.

==Example==
The following spreadsheet table compares value averaging with [[dollar cost averaging]]:

|height=580
}}&lt;br /&gt;
{{trim|{{Spreadsheet|key=1sqEPSLZUCSvNxVyO5D4Dg_gSAL56gfL7Jia4mBRxGmo}}}}

==Cautions and qualifications==
*Value averaging adds a growth factor (by formula, consisting of estimates of both the investment's return as well as growth in the contribution level) to the regular periodic investment of savings flows. If your contribution amount is not expected to grow, you should set this factor at 0% so that investment growth is the only growth variable. 
*Value averaging may need both purchases and sales of the underlying investment, based on the investment performance of the investment. It requires a cash account for prospective purchases as well as any sales proceeds.
*Value averaging sales can realize taxable capital gains. You might want to restrict it to tax advantaged accounts; or alternately, adopt a policy constraint forbidding or delaying sales in the taxable account.
*You have to be careful in a declining market, as you will need to have additional funds available for investment. As time progresses and the account value grows, you may need even more funds to reach the amount required for the chosen period. If the market is volatile near the end of the investing time frame, you will need a lot of additional funds. This may catch investors unprepared for this additional savings requirement.
*Value averaging most often provides a lower average cost per share than does DCA, and also provides for a higher internal rate of return (IRR). This does not, however, mean that value averaging will result in a higher realized profit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://ssrn.com/abstract=1606347| author=Simon Hayley| title=Value Averaging and the Automated Bias of Performance Measures| date=March 11, 2011| accessdate=August 13, 2023}}.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is when investors make regular, equal payments into a [[Mutual fund|mutual fund]], trading account or [[Employer Retirement Plans Overview|retirement account,]] such as a [[401(k)]]. Systematic investing encourages you to establish a regular savings habit, and because you make purchases at various market prices, in essence you [[Dollar cost averaging|dollar-cost-average]] the average purchase price of your investments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/systematicinvestmentplan.asp| title=Systematic Investment Plan (SIP): Definition and Example| publisher=Investopedia| accessdate=September 17, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The way most investors invest systematically is in employer-provided contributory retirement plans. However, investment firms generally offer programs that let you set up individual systematic investment. These programs include [[#Automatic investment plans|Automatic investment plans]] and [[#Contractual investment plans|Contractual investment plans]].

==Automatic investment plans==
Many providers offer an '''Automatic Investment Plan''' (AIP), an investment program that lets you contribute small amounts of money in regular (monthly, quarterly, semiannual, or annual) intervals. Funds are automatically deducted from your checking/savings account or paycheck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/automaticinvestmentplan.asp| title=Automatic Investment Plan: How it Works, Different Types| publisher=Investopedia| accessdate=September 17, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt; AIPs most commonly offer [[mutual fund]]s (both in [[Principles of Tax-Efficient Fund Placement|taxable accounts]] and [[Traditional IRA|IRA]] accounts), [[Variable Annuity|variable annuity]] subaccounts, and [[529 plans|529 savings plan]] funds.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;For an example of AIP, see: {{cite web| url=https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/personal-finance/automate-savings| title=Automated investing: How to save and invest more| publisher=Fidelity| accessdate=September 17, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If you want to establish an AIP following the [[Bogleheads' philosophy]], consider establishing AIP programs with low cost no-load mutual funds, no-load low cost variable annuities, and direct sold [[529 cost comparisons|low-cost 529 plan]] portfolios.

==Contractual investment plans==
{{Warning|In an investor alert regarding contractual plans FINRA offers the following advice:&lt;ref name="FINRA"/&gt;
{{blockquote|For a specific type of systematic investment plan—sometimes referred to as a "contractual plan" or "periodic payment plan"—an investor must make a long-term commitment of 10 or 15 years. While the majority of these plans are sold to military personnel, they are also sold to civilians. These plans come with high upfront costs and are expensive if the full term of payment is not completed. If your goal is to save for retirement, most employer savings and retirement plans allow you to save through payroll deduction. Military personnel can make long-term periodic investments in the U.S. Thrift Savings Plan. This plan has no up-front load and low on-going expenses}}}}

Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs) in the US are regulated as Periodic Investment Plans under the federal securities laws. A typical SIP contractual plan lets you accumulate shares of a mutual fund indirectly by making small regular monthly payments, usually as little as $50, over a period of 10, 15 or 25 years. Historically, the majority of contractual plans have been sold to [[Military finances|military personnel]]. These plans impose high upfront commission costs, as much as 50% of the first year payments, and are especially expensive if the full term of the plan is not completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/investor_protection_guide_systematic_investment_plan_%28sip%29| title=Investor Protection Guide: Systematic Investment Plan (SIP)| publisher=Legal Information Institute| accessdate=September 17, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contractual plans have the following characteristics:&lt;ref name="FINRA"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.finra.org/Investors/ProtectYourself/InvestorAlerts/MutualFunds/p012785A| title=Systematic Investment Plans—Educate Yourself Before You Enlist| publisher=FINRA| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190117214257/http://www.finra.org/investors/alerts/systematic-investment-plans| archive-date=January 17, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''High first-year cost'''. You are required to pay a creation and sales charge equal to as much as 50 percent of the first 12 monthly investments. If you increase the amount of your monthly payments, you may owe an additional creation and sales charge on the new investment.
*'''Long-term investment'''. Typically, systematic investment plans require 180 fixed monthly payments over a 15-year period, with the option of making payments for up to 25 years (300 investments).
*'''No direct mutual fund ownership.''' Investments in a contractual plan are placed in a trust. The trust invests your regular payments, minus fees and expenses, in shares of a mutual fund.
*'''Missed Payments'''. The sponsor may terminate your plan if you fail to make investments for a period of 6 or 12 consecutive months.
*'''Fees and expenses'''. Plan expenses include creation and sales charge fees, mutual fund management and distribution expenses, and various custodial and service fees. The following table shows the cost burden of the creation and sales charge:
:{| class="wikitable" align="center"
|+ Contractual plan creation and sales fee expense
|-
! Contributions discontinued after !! Creation and sales fee as percentage of investment
|-
| 12 payments || 50%
|-
| 18 payments || 31.6%
|-
| 24 payments || 25%
|-
| 60 payments || 10%
|-
| 180 payments || 5%
|-
| 360 payments || 3.3%
|}
*'''Cancellation and Refund Rights'''. An investor in a contractual plan can cancel the contract with the following rights:
**'''45-Day Cancellation Right'''. You will receive a notice of your cancellation rights within 60 days after your first investment in the plan. You can cancel your plan within 45 days of the mailing date of that notice. If you choose to cancel your plan, you will receive a cash refund equal to (1) the current value of your investment and (2) the total sales and creation charge you paid. The current value of your shares may be more or less than your original investment. 
**'''18-Month Cancellation Right.''' You are also able cancel the plan within 18 months after your first investment in the plan. If you choose to cancel your plan after the 45-day cancellation period, you will receive a cash refund equal to (1) the current value of your investment and (2) the amount of the sales and creation charge you paid that exceeds 15 percent of the total investments you have made in the plan. You should receive a notice of your 18-month cancellation right if you miss (1) three or more of your monthly investment payments during the first 15 months of the plan or (2) one or more payments after the first 15 months.
:If you cancel your plan after 18 months, you will not be entitled to a refund of any creation and sales charge. This charge can be up to 50 percent of your periodic investments.

{{Notice|
If you are considering hiring an investment adviser (financial adviser, broker, or investment firm) it is important that you '''check their background credentials''' and any complaints on file. The SEC and FINRA offer free tools to help with this, discussed [[#Background checks | below]].
}}
'''Investment Advisers''' (IA)&lt;ref group=note&gt;U.S. financial law spelling uses ''adviser'', while elsewhere the spelling is ''advisor''.&lt;/ref&gt; are people or firms who are paid to give advice on investing in securities such as stocks, bonds, [[mutual fund]]s, or [[exchange-traded fund]]s (ETFs). Depending on their classification, ''Investment Adviser'' are regulated. For example, an ''Investment Adviser'' who registers with the [http://www.sec.gov/ Securities and Exchange Commission] (SEC) must follow a fiduciary standard to act in their client's best interest. An adviser registered with the SEC is known as a ''Registered Investment Adviser'' (RIA).

== Investment advisers ==
Although many of the people who work at advisory firms fall under the definition of "investment adviser," the SEC generally does not require them to register individually as advisers with the SEC. Instead, the advisory ''firm'' itself must register with the SEC. The firm's registration covers its employees ''and'' other people under its control, provided they are working on the firm's behalf.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.sec.gov/about/offices/oia/oia_investman/rplaze-042006.pdf| title=The Regulation of Investment Advisers| publisher=SEC.gov| date=November 22, 2006| accessdate=August 31, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, only firms can be ''Registered Investment Advisers'' (RIA), while its employees can only be ''Investment Adviser Representatives'' (IAR).&lt;ref&gt;{{forum link| p=1198928| title=A Firm is an RIA, Not a Person| date=October 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Registered Investment Advisers'' may not use the term “registered investment adviser” unless they are registered, nor can they use it to suggest a level of professional competence, education or special training. The term "RIA" should not appear after a person’s name, because using initials after a name usually indicates a degree or a licensed professional position requiring qualifications, and there are no federal qualifications for becoming an SEC-registered adviser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.sec.gov/divisions/investment/advoverview.htm| title=Information for Newly-Registered Investment Advisers| publisher=SEC.gov| date=November 23, 2010| accessdate=August 31, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, someone could not use "RIA" on their business card.&lt;ref&gt;{{forum link| t=83550| title=A Firm is an RIA, Not a Person| date=October 3, 2011| author=[[Rick Ferri]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Investment advisers who manage less than $100 million in assets must register with the state securities agency in the state where they have their principal place of business.&lt;ref name="RIA"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Registered_investment_adviser| title=Registered investment adviser| publisher=Wikipedia| accessdate=August 31, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anyone registered with the FINRA typically makes commissions and fees from the products they sell (brokerage or mutual fund company). They must provide their clients with products that are "[[#Suitability|suitable]]" (the suitability standard), but not necessarily the cheapest or the best.&lt;ref name="SECFin"&gt;{{forum link| p=1189157| title=Investment Advisor or do it ourselves| date=September 26, 2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulations==
Section 202(a)(11)(C) of the [[wikipedia:Investment Advisers Act of 1940|Investment Advisers Act of 1940]] exempts&lt;ref name="RIA" /&gt; from the definition of an ''Investment Adviser'' (and therefore the associated fiduciary standard){{blockquote|... any ''broker or dealer'' whose performance of such services is solely incidental to the conduct of his business as a broker or dealer and who receives no special compensation therefor.}}

In [https://www.sec.gov/file/release-nos-34-51523 Release 34-51523], the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) (the US Securities Self Regulatory Organization (SRO) with authority over ''Brokers and Dealers'') determined that Broker-Dealers are "not to be deemed investment advisers" and therefore are not required to follow the same fiduciary standards as ''Investment Advisers'' when recommending investments to clients (as are ''Registered Investment Advisers'' (RIA)).

Registered Representatives (RRs) affiliated with a [[wikipedia:Broker-dealer|Broker-dealer]] must therefore recommend securities that are deemed "[[#Suitability|suitable]]" for non-institutional clients.

===Suitability===
''Suitability'' means that a broker can sell ''any'' fund or any investment as long as it fits the purpose. For example, if stocks are suitable for an investor, then it does not matter if a broker advises an 8% load stock fund that has 3% in annual fees because it is agreed that stocks in general are a suitable, and so any diversified stock mutual fund will do.&lt;ref name="RF"&gt;{{forum link| p=1192950| title=Ameriprise employees sue firm for lousy 401k choices| date=September 30, 2011| author=[[Rick Ferri]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Suitability is entirely different from fiduciary standard. Under a fiduciary standard, an investment adviser must not only recommend suitable investments, but they must also recommend funds that are in the best interest of their client. Clearly, a fund with an 8% load and 3% in fees is not in the best interest of anyone. Low-cost index funds are in the best interest of clients.&lt;ref name="RF" /&gt;

This is the difference between a broker's investment recommendations under a ''suitability'' standard, and an investment adviser's recommendations under a ''fiduciary'' standard.&lt;ref name="RF" /&gt;

===Fiduciary standard===
On April 8, 2016, the Department of Labor issued revised regulations which widens the definition of a ''fiduciary'' for advisers who have control over retirement plans. This aims to avoid a conflict of interest between an adviser (including a broker-dealer) and the client. Firms must have complied with these new rules by July 1, 2019. Before July 1, 2019, advisers could ''intend'' to comply with these rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ebsa/ebsa20171127-0| title=U.S. Department of Labor Extends Transition Period For Fiduciary Rule Exemptions| publisher=US Department of Labor| accessdate=August 31, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Before July 1, 2019, the Department of Labor did not pursue claims against fiduciaries who worked diligently and in good faith to comply with the Fiduciary Rule.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background checks==
If you are considering hiring an investment adviser (financial adviser, broker, or investment firm) it is important that you '''check their background credentials''' and any complaints on file. The SEC and FINRA offer free tools to help you do this.

It is a good idea for you to use both tools. If you cannot find a financial adviser in the SEC's Investment Adviser Public Disclosure (IARD) database, but you do find them in FINRA's Broker Check, you can consider this adviser to be a product salesperson.&lt;ref name="SECFin" /&gt;

The SEC's Investment Adviser Public Disclosure (IAPD) database provides information about current and former Investment Adviser Representatives (IARs) and Investment Adviser firms registered with the SEC and/or state securities regulators.&lt;ref name="IAS"&gt;[http://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=1188999#p1188999 Investment Advisor or do it ourselves], forum discussion, direct link to post.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[https://adviserinfo.sec.gov/ Investment Adviser Search], from the [http://www.sec.gov/ SEC]
Choose either ''Individual'' or ''Firm'' to start. Be sure browser cookies are enabled. The results will contain links to "Investment Adviser Firm" or "Brokerage Firm" as applicable.

====Brokerage firm====
The Brokerage Firm link will launch into the FINRA's BrokerCheck ([[#FINRA BrokerCheck |below]]) which provides additional information such as a state-by-state breakdown where a broker is licensed to practice, or if any complaints have been filed.

====Investment adviser firm====
The "Investment Adviser Firm" link goes to Form ADV (Uniform Application for Investment Adviser Registration), each section appearing in a menu on the left-hand side. Among other items, you can use Form ADV to see if a firm offers [[Financial planning | financial planning]], as opposed to providing investment advice.&lt;ref name="Kennedy"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://simplesmartinvesting.com/?p=175| title=How to select an investment adviser| date=March 10, 2013| author=Ian Kennedy| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313201150/http://simplesmartinvesting.com/?p=175| archive-date=March 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Go to "Item 5 Information About Your Advisory Business" in the ADV form and look for:

*5F(1): Do you provide continuous and regular supervisory or management services to securities portfolios? 

If the answer to 5F(1) is ''No'', this firm is not in the investment advisory business. It might give investment advice and sell investment products, but that does not make it an investment adviser that you want to manage your money.

Critically important is "Item 11 Disclosure Information." Every "No" box on this page should be checked, because a "Yes" indicates that the firm has violated some of the laws and regulations governing registered investment advisers.

Where a "Yes" is present, the firm must detail on form ADV the date and nature of the infraction, and how it was settled. A minor infraction, perhaps from some administrative error involving small amounts of money, may be forgiven, but you want to closely scrutinize any "Yes" on this page.&lt;ref name="Kennedy" /&gt;

===FINRA BrokerCheck===
The [http://www.finra.org/index.htm Financial Industry Regulatory Authority], known as FINRA, is the largest non-governmental regulator for all securities firms doing business with the United States public—more than 5,000 firms employing more than 660,000 registered representatives. FINRA was created in 2007, consolidating NASD and NYSE Member Regulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.finra.org/AboutFINRA/| title=About the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority| publisher=FINRA| accessdate=August 31, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FINRA BrokerCheck is a free tool to help investors check the professional background of current and former FINRA-registered securities firms and brokers. It should be the first resource you turn to when choosing whether to do business with a particular broker or brokerage firm. Note that financial advisers can also be registered brokers.

Enable browser cookies. At the report summary, select "View Full PDF Report" (upper right corner) to get the full details. If applicable, the FINRA report will show any complaints filed against the adviser.

==Investment advisory fees==
Some advisers may not charge for managing money market funds. If the exclude money market funds in the total portfolio value, you may be paying a different fee than you expect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Forum link| title=Wiki - Investment adviser - Advisory fees may not include money market funds| t=393371| author=LadyGeek| date=December 27, 2022}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Please check your adviser's service agreement for this exclusion.

=== Tax deductions ===
Before 2018, you could deduct fees paid to investment advisers for portfolio management ("investment counsel and advice") on your taxes, if the fees exceeded 2% of your adjusted gross income (AGI).&lt;ref group="note"&gt;You used to categorize investment advisory fees, sometimes known as "wrap fees", as a miscellaneous itemized deduction. Miscellaneous itemized deductions have been removed from the tax code. See: [[Outline of tax law changes]].&lt;/ref&gt;

After 2018, you can no longer deduct advisory fees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.schwab.com/learn/story/investment-expenses-whats-tax-deductible| title=Investment Expenses: What's Tax Deductible?| publisher=Charles Schwab| date=December 6, 2022| accessdate=August 31, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 6, 2013 Vanguard announced the creation of '''four fund portfolios''' by adding a strategic allocation of [[Developed market bonds|international hedged bonds]] to the firm's series of target date ([[Vanguard Target Retirement Funds|Target Retirement]]) and target risk ([[Vanguard LifeStrategy Funds|LifeStrategy]]) funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://pressroom.vanguard.com/content/press_release/2013.02.06_Vanguard_to_Further_Diversify_Target_Retirement_Funds.html| title=Vanguard to Further Diversify Target Retirement Funds| date=February 6, 2013| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190117081102/https://pressroom.vanguard.com/content/news/2013.02.06_Vanguard_to_Further_Diversify_Target_Retirement_Funds.html| archive-date=January 17, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; These funds are commonly offered by [[Employer Retirement Plans Overview|employer provided plans]], where they are often default investment options; in [[529 plans|529 college savings plans]]; and in [[IRA|individual retirement arrangements]].

The allocation plan adds the Vanguard International Bond Index fund to the portfolio asset mix. This bond fund is hedged to reduce currency risk.

==Three fund and four fund portfolios==

Prior to the addition of an international bond fund to the target date and target risk funds, the allocation of these balanced portfolios were versions of the very popular [[Three-Fund Portfolio|three fund portfolio]],&lt;ref&gt;{{forum link| t=88005| title=The Three Fund Portfolio}}&lt;/ref&gt; which consists of three broad asset class index funds:
* Total U.S. stock market index fund
* Total international stock index fund
* Total U.S. bond index fund

The four-fund portfolio that Vanguard is now using consists of the following broad asset class index funds:
* Total U.S. stock market index fund
* Total international stock index fund
* Total U.S. bond index fund
* Total international bond index fund

From 2013 - 2015 Vanguard allocated 30% of a portfolio's stock allocation to international stocks and allocated 20% of a portfolio's nominal bond allocation to international bonds.

Beginning in 2015, Vanguard increased the international allocations to the four fund portfolios. International stock allocations increased from 30% to 40% of a portfolio's stock allocation. International bonds increased from 20% to 30% of a portfolio's nominal bond allocation. The allocation changes began in the second quarter of 2015 and were completed before year-end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://institutional.vanguard.com/VGApp/iip/site/institutional/researchcommentary/article/NewsInstinfo022615QA| title=2015 changes to Target Retirement Funds, Q&amp;A| publisher=Vanguard Institutional| date=February 26, 2015| accessdate=28 February 2015}}{{dead link}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://institutional.vanguard.com/VGApp/iip/site/institutional/researchcommentary/article/NewsInstinfo022615| title=Expanded target-date lineup, more diversification| publisher=Vanguard| date=February 26, 2015| accessdate=August 9, 2015}}{{dead link}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==MATLAB clones==
MATLAB® (MATrix LABoratory) is a high-level language and interactive environment for numerical computation, visualization, and programming. It is neither open source nor free. However, it's an industry standard and open source clones have been developed which strive to emulate MATLAB functionality.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;See [http://www.dspguru.com/dsp/links/matlab-clones Matlab Clones] for a detailed overview.&lt;/ref&gt;

Below are examples which run in [http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/ Octave] or MATLAB. Bogleheads forum member camontgo developed and maintains this code at [http://www.calculatinginvestor.com/ The Calculating Investor].

===Efficient frontier (mean-variance optimization)===
This is a 3-part series which calculates the efficient frontier for a set of securities.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The example covariance matrix could be replaced with a real covariance matrix. For example, the R-script for downloading Yahoo Finance returns could be used to get returns for a set of assets, and the covariance matrix could be calculated and used as the input to these scripts...though the scaling would probably need to be changed.&lt;/ref&gt; These efficient frontier calculations are not very practical. The results are too sensitive to small changes in the inputs, but it is educational since a lot of financial theory builds on some of the ideas underlying Markowitz.&lt;ref name="PM"&gt;camontgo PM to LadyGeek.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rebalancing bonus===

===Market timing===
In 1975, Nobel laureate William Sharpe published a study titled “Likely Gains from Market Timing”. In this paper, Sharpe reportedly found that a market timer who switches between 100% stocks and 100% T-bills on an annual basis must be correct about 74% of the time (on average) to beat the market.&lt;ref name="Mkt"&gt;[http://www.calculatinginvestor.com/2011/02/21/market-timing/ Market Timing: How good is good enough?], from [http://www.calculatinginvestor.com/ The Calculating Investor]&lt;/ref&gt;

This Monte Carlo simulation uses a simple market timing strategy to determine the market timing accuracy required to outperform buy-and-hold. A comparison of market timing to buy-and-hold in terms of both total returns and risk-adjusted returns (measured by the Sharpe Ratio) is performed. The analysis shows that a surprisingly high (and unlikely) degree of accuracy is necessary to beat the market return through market timing.&lt;ref name="PM" /&gt;
*[http://www.calculatinginvestor.com/2011/02/21/market-timing/ Market Timing: How good is good enough?], from [http://www.calculatinginvestor.com/ The Calculating Investor]
The factor data is obtained from the [http://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/data_library.html Kenneth R. French - Data Library], under [http://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/ftp/F-F_Research_Data_Factors.zip  Fama/French Factors] (direct link). Be sure to remove the file headers and the extra data sets (starting around row 1046). Save the file as F-F_Factors_annual.txt.

This simulation takes a long time to run. To start, reduce the number of iterations from 10,000 to a lower number (such as 100) and ensure that the analysis is functioning correctly.

==Python==
[http://www.python.org/ Python] is a rapid development scripting language that is suitable for many tasks.  Using add in libraries like [http://www.numpy.org/ NumPy] and [http://pandas.pydata.org/ pandas] make it easy to do financial analysis. There are many [https://wiki.python.org/moin/IntegratedDevelopmentEnvironments IDEs]

The asset correlation analysis described [[#Asset correlation | above]] is available in Python. See [[finiki:Using open source software for portfolio analysis#Python | finiki]] for the source code.

=== I savings bonds ===
Forum member AnonJohn, with modifications by several members, has developed a script which creates a spreadsheet containing helpful [[I savings bonds|I-Bond]] information, such as keeping track of penalty amounts and interest rates.

The script inputs a spreadsheet containing the bonds' issue data and price. It scrapes rates directly from the Treasury website, so (until that changes format) there is no need for manual updating. This is more convenient than a complex spreadsheet and more complete than the Treasury tool.

[[Bogleheads investment philosophy|Bogleheads]] generally accept that the best portfolios use passive management, low costs, wide diversification and aim for tax efficiency. The simplest way to achieve these is to use a low-cost passive [[Indexing|index fund]]. However, you may find that constructing your own portfolio of individual [[stock]]s offers some cost or tax advantages, and these advantages may be enough to overcome any potential disadvantages from a less diversified portfolio.

In ''Common Sense on Mutual Funds'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=John Bogle| author-link=John Bogle| title=Common Sense on Mutual Funds| pages=373-401| isbn=978-0-470-13813-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Bogle]] suggests that a reasonable alternative to an index fund for some investors would be to hold a well-diversified portfolio of individual stocks, as long as they are held long-term, and minimizing trading costs. This article outlines some suggestions for how to build a portfolio of individual stocks to cover at least part of your overall stock allocation. It also aims to summarize the advantages and possible pitfalls of doing this.

The discussion here assumes that you are not trying to beat the market, but instead '''passively managing individual stocks''' to create your own "DIY index fund."

==Advantages==
Holding a well-diversified portfolio of passively managed individual stocks instead of index funds may give you some cost advantages, and more opportunities for [[Tax loss harvesting|tax-loss harvesting]] and for [[Donating appreciated securities|donating appreciated assets]].

[[Taxation as a US person living abroad|US citizens living abroad]] can have [[US tax pitfalls for a US person living abroad|special difficulties]] using index funds, and these may also make holding individual stocks a suitable option. 

===Costs===
One obvious advantage that individual stocks have over an index fund is an [[Expense ratio|expense ratio]] (ER) of zero. Depending on what class of stocks you are trying to cover, this may or may not be a significant advantage in itself. For example, index funds for single-country or single-industry stocks often have expense ratios of 0.5% or more, and here the saving from using individual stocks would be more substantial than for the broader [[S&amp;P 500 index]].

A hidden cost in mutual funds is the [[Mutual funds: additional costs#Transaction costs|impact of turnover]], because those costs are not reflected in the expense ratio. If you have a lower turnover than a comparable index fund, you will probably have lower turnover costs. And an index fund may be forced to trade, to track companies removed from or added to the index, while someone with a limited portfolio is not forced to make as many changes.

===Taxes===
Individual stocks offer many more opportunities for tax-loss harvesting than index funds. Estimates put the potential advantage at about 0.5%/year, depending on your tax bracket.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author1=Robert D. Arnott| author2=Andrew L. Berkin Ph.D| author3=Jia Ye Ph.D| url=https://www.firstquadrant.com/downloads/The_Management.pdf| title=Tax Management and Mismanagement of Taxable Assets| date=2000| publisher=First Quadrant| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061018073306/http://www.firstquadrant.com/downloads/The_Management.pdf| archive-date=October 18, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author1=Robert D. Arnott| author2=Andrew L. Berkin Ph.D| author3=Jia Ye Ph.D| url=https://www.firstquadrant.com/downloads/Tax_Management_Loss.pdf| title=Tax Management, Loss Harvesting, and HIFO Accounting| date=2003| publisher=First Quadrant| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061018072846/http://www.firstquadrant.com/downloads/Tax_Management_Loss.pdf| archive-date=October 18, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If you have individual stocks you can find additional tax management benefits through donations, gifting and dividend yield management. The [[#Tax management| tax management section]] below discusses these in more depth.

====US taxpayers abroad====
In particular, if you are a US taxpayer living outside the US (but still subject to citizenship-based taxation):
* US tax law treats almost all locally-domiciled and non-US domiciled index funds as a [[passive foreign investment company]] (PFIC), and this creates extremely unfavorable taxation; and
* US-domiciled funds may not be available to you, or they may have unfavorable or double taxation in your country of residence, or they may have high expense ratios (for example, single-country funds covering your country of residence).
Given these constraints, US taxpayers living outside the US may find that a portfolio of individual stocks is the best way to invest.

==Disadvantages==
Although creating a portfolio of individual stocks has some advantages, keep the following in mind. An individual stock portfolio will be less diversified than the market portfolio, and will be exposed to the problem of market skewness. Also, a portfolio of individual stocks is likely to need more bookkeeping than investing in a total market index fund. Finally, empirical studies have shown that investors are susceptible to [[behavioral pitfalls]] that result in poor performance. 

===Diversification===
By definition, any subset of stocks is less diversified than the whole market, and so exposes you to greater [[Risk and return: an introduction#Specific_types_of_risk|unsystematic risk]].

===Skewness===
Individual stocks generally exhibit positive [[skewness]], meaning that most stocks will have a somewhat lower return than the market average, with a few having much higher return. As noted by Bernstein&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=William Bernstein| author-link=William Bernstein| url=http://www.efficientfrontier.com/ef/900/15st.htm| title=The 15-Stock Diversification Myth| date=2000| publisher=Efficient Frontier| accessdate=November 13, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many others, any subset of stocks is likely have a lower return than the whole market, due to failing to include some of the highest performers; that is, the median return is lower than the mean return.

Skewness is more pronounced in smaller stocks, so that a strategy of investing only in Large Capital individual stocks (and using mutual funds for diversification in other areas) tends to be less exposed to this issue.

===Documentation===
You will have to track more cost bases (see [[Passively managing individual stocks#Record keeping|below]]) for a collection of individual stocks than for a single index fund, depending on how you made the purchases (for example, single lump-sum into the index instead of monthly purchases). In addition, individual stocks sometimes create taxable or other paperwork-generating events such as going private, getting bought out, going bankrupt and splitting. This is particularly the case with smaller cap stocks.

===Behavioral effects===
Owning individual stocks instead of an index fund is like seeing how the proverbial sausage is made.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;This is an idiomatic phrase, meaning that knowledge of the underlying process may be unpleasant.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of your stocks will rocket up, some will go out of business, and, because of the skewness mentioned [[#Skewness |above]], the majority will underperform the market as a whole. Of course, the same things happen inside an index fund, but hidden from view. While these gyrations can give you opportunities to save tax, they also take some getting used to. Not everyone wants to watch the sausage production process in their portfolio with equanimity. Know yourself.

These difficulties are evident in empirical studies of the stock trading [[Behavioral pitfalls|behavior]] of individual stock market investors. [[Terrance Odean|Odean]] and [[Brad M. Barber|Barber]] have studied individual performance (beginning in 1991)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author1=Brad M.

==How many stocks?==
There are several different ways to estimate the minimum number of stocks you should aim to hold. A few approaches found in the academic literature are discussed here. While none of the papers discussed below provide a definitive answer to that question, they may help to give you some ideas.

===Meir Statman===
[[Meir Statman]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Meir Statman| author-link=Meir Statman| url=https://ssrn.com/abstract=365241| title=How Much Diversification is Enough?| date=October 2002| accessdate=November 13, 2023}} Available at SSRN.&lt;/ref&gt; provides the following formula for the benefit &lt;math&gt;B_{nm}&lt;/math&gt; in terms of risk-adjusted return gained by moving from &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; stocks to &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; stocks:
:&lt;math&gt;
B_{nm} = \left(\sqrt{\frac{\frac{1}{n}+\frac{n-1}{n}\rho}{\frac{1}{m}+\frac{m-1}{m}\rho}}-1\right)EP
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the expected correlation between any pair of stocks, and &lt;math&gt;EP&lt;/math&gt; is the expected equity premium. (In his paper, he uses &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; = 0.08,&lt;ref group="note"&gt; Estimate for 1997 from p. 23 of John Y. Campbell, Martin Lettau, Burton G. Malkiel, and Yexiao Xu, [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/0022-1082.00318/pdf Have Individual Stocks Become More Volatile? An Empirical Exploration of Idiosyncratic Risk](2001).&lt;/ref&gt; and &lt;math&gt;EP&lt;/math&gt; = 8.79%/year.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The "mean realized equity premium during 1926-2001." But, he also notes, "today there is little agreement that it is a fair estimate of the expected equity premium. Fama and French (2001) estimated the expected equity premium based on P/E ratios and dividend yield. The average of the two is 3.44%." See Fama, Eugene F. and French, Kenneth R., ''[http://ssrn.com/abstract=236590 The Equity Premium]'' (April 2001). EFMA 2001 Lugano Meetings; CRSP Working Paper No. 522. Available at SSRN. &lt;/ref&gt;)

This formula assumes simple Gaussian return distributions with zero skewness (which is known not to be correct, as noted [[#Skewness |above]]), and requires the use of some assumptions about correlation and equity premium, but with those caveats in mind, it is useful to get a ballpark idea of the minimum number of stocks to aim for.

Taking as an example an investor in Canada who is a US taxpayer, for whom the best non-PFIC alternative for covering Canadian stocks might be the [https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239615/ishares-msci-canada-etf iShares MSCI Canada ETF (EWC)]. EWC has &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; = 97 stocks, and an ER of 0.49%/year. If the investor holds at least &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; individual Canadian stocks such that &lt;math&gt;B_{nm}&lt;/math&gt; &lt; 0.49%/year, that investor will have a higher expected risk-adjusted return by holding those individual stocks than by holding the ETF.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;This considers only the difference in ER, and ignores any difference in commissions between buying individual stocks and buying EWC, currency exchange costs incurred to buy EWC (which itself incurs hidden exchange costs internally), any unfavorable tax implications there may be on the Canadian side due to holding an offshore-domiciled ETF, weighting differences, skewness effects, tax loss harvesting, etc.&lt;/ref&gt; Using the somewhat bold assumption that &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;EP&lt;/math&gt; for the Canadian market are similar to the values Statman uses above for the US market, the investor expectantly comes out ahead over EWC after about 50 stocks.

For another example, a US taxpayer in Japan might consider [https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239665/ishares-msci-japan-etf iShares MSCI Japan ETF (EWJ)] for Japanese equities, which has 317 holdings and 0.49%/year expense ratio. That investor would have a higher expected risk-adjusted return than EWJ after about 75 individual Japanese stocks.

For the above two investors, the minimum required number of stocks would go down if possible savings due to tax-loss harvesting are taken into account. However, since they both have to pay taxes to two different governments, based on gains and losses calculated in two different currencies that float relative to each other, the tax-loss harvesting opportunities would likely be considerably reduced as compared to a taxpayer subject only to one country's tax code.

A US-based investor, on the other hand, might instead expect for tax-loss harvesting to provide a bigger benefit than ER savings. In comparison to an S&amp;P 500 index fund such as the [{{Vf | 0968}} Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF (VOO)] with ER of 0.05%/year, if the expected tax savings from tax loss harvesting are 0.5%/year, that investor would expect to come out ahead of VOO on a risk-adjusted basis after about 75 stocks. If the expected tax savings are 1%/year, that number falls to about 40 stocks. Similar considerations would apply to any investor based outside the US who is not also a US taxpayer.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Or, perhaps, an Eritrean taxpayer, Eritrea being the other country, besides the US, that taxes its non-resident citizens.&lt;/ref&gt;

Note that the minimum number of stocks according to this formula goes down for lower values of &lt;math&gt;EP&lt;/math&gt;, and higher values of &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;.

Meir Statman's formula implicitly assumes portfolios of equally-weighted stocks. For a capitalization-weighted index, the effective number of stocks would be less than the actual number, because the fluctuations of the largest capitalization stocks contribute much more to the overall portfolio volatility than to those of the smallest capitalization stocks (though this would be partially counterbalanced by the higher individual volatilities of smaller-capitalization stocks). If you are comparing a roughly equal-weighted portfolio to a capitalization-weighted index fund, substituting the effective number of stocks in the index for the actual number would produce a somewhat lower suggested minimum number of individual stocks to hold. On the other hand, accounting for skewness should lead to an increase in the suggested minimum number of stocks to hold.

===Ronald Surz and Mitchell Price===
Ronald Surz and Mitchell Price (2000)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author1=Ronald J. Surz| author2=Mitchell Price| url=https://ppca-inc.com/articles/DiversByNumbers.pdf| title=The Truth About Diversification By Numbers| date=2000| publisher=Journal of Investing| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231201153807/https://ppca-inc.com/articles/DiversByNumbers.pdf| archive-date=December 1, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; examine diversification measures such as R-squared and [[Tracking error|tracking error]] for US individual stock selections over the January 1986 - June 1999 period.

Over this period the overall market experienced a [[Standard deviation|standard deviation]] of 14.5%. A single stock portfolio provided an average standard deviation of 45.0%; a fifteen stock portfolio averaged 16.5% (range 14.3% - 19.2%); a thirty stock portfolio averaged 15.4% (range 13.9% - 17.5%); a sixty stock portfolio averaged 15.2% (range 13.6% - 17.2%).

While one individual stock has a standard deviation of 45% and the entire market has 14.5%, portfolios of 30 stocks are shown to eliminate 97% of the excess (diversifiable) standard deviation. A 60 stock portfolio eliminates 98% of excess standard deviation.

Ronald Surz and Mitchell Price found that increasing the number of stocks in a portfolio increased the portfolio's R-squared and reduced portfolio tracking error.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Ronald Surz and Mitchell Price find that for random 15-stock portfolios R-squared averaged 0.76 (range 0.63 - 0.86); for 30-stock portfolios the average was 0.86 (range 0.76 -0.91); for 60-stock portfolios, an average of 0.88 (range 0.79 - 0.94).&lt;br&gt; Tracking errors for random portfolios: 8.1% for 15-stock portfolios; 6.2% for 30-stock portfolios; 5.3% for 60-stock portfolios.&lt;br&gt; Tracking errors for optimized portfolios: 5.4% for 15-stock portfolios; 4.2% for 30-stock portfolios; 3.5% for 60-stock portfolios.&lt;br&gt; Tracking errors for portfolios selecting the largest stocks: 7.5% for 15-stock portfolios; 5.2% for 30-stock portfolios; 4.1% for 60-stock portfolios.&lt;/ref&gt; The authors suggest two methods for reducing tracking error over random stock selection:
# Professional money managers can use portfolio optimization.
# A less sophisticated approach can invest in the largest capitalization stocks.

===David Ikenberry, Richard Shockley and Kent Womack===
David Ikenberry, Richard Shockley and Kent Womack&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author1=David L. Ikenberry| author2=Richard L. Shockley| author3=Kent L. Womack| url=http://www-2.rotman.utoronto.ca/kent.womack/publications/publications/skewness.pdf| title=Why active fund managers often underperform the S&amp;P 500 index: The impact of size and skewness}}{{dead link}}&lt;/ref&gt; use historical backtesting over the 34-year period from 1962 through 1995 to examine the impact of skewness, which they measure as the difference between the mean and median yearly average return for an n-stock portfolio, for several values of n from 15 to 150. They found that for 35-stock portfolios, where the stocks are randomly chosen from the S&amp;P 500 index and equally weighted, the average yearly median portfolio return lags the mean by 0.22%. This number goes down to 0.14% for 50-stock portfolios, 0.09% for 75-stock portfolios, 0.06% for 100-stock portfolios, and 0.03% for 150-stock portfolios. The skewness cost is somewhat lower for capitalization-weighted portfolios, and for equal-weighted portfolios where the probability of selecting a stock is proportional to its market capitalization. For more details, see Table V and Figure 2 of their paper.

They do not find evidence of any systematic return penalty for sub-sampling the S&amp;P 500 index. (However, they are not comparing risk-adjusted returns, just straight returns, so their results cannot be directly compared with, for example, Meir Statman's formula.) They find that for the portfolios where the holdings are capitalization weighted, or equally weighted but selected with a probability proportional to capitalization, the yearly mean and median returns slightly exceed the return of the S&amp;P 500 index itself, though not by statistically significant amounts (about 1-sigma in standard deviation of the mean, if calculated using the yearly numbers in their Table II). They also find that equal-probability, equal-weighted portfolios show about a 2.5% boost in mean and median returns compared to the capitalization-weighted portfolios, and slightly more compared to the S&amp;P 500 index itself. This is only a little over a 2-sigma effect (again, calculating from their yearly numbers in Table II), but suggests the presence of a measurable small-cap premium even within the confines of the S&amp;P 500 universe.

===Dale Domian, David Louton and Marie Racine===
Dale Domian, David Louton and Marie Racine&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author1=Dale L. Domian| author2=David A. Louton| author3=Marie D. Racine| url=https://ssrn.com/abstract=906686| title=Diversification in Portfolios of Individual Stocks: 100 Stocks are Not Enough| date=April 2006| accessdate=November 13, 2023}} Available at SSRN.&lt;/ref&gt; use historical backtesting over the 20-year period from Jan 1985 to Dec 2004 to study the effect of the number of stocks in a portfolio on [[Risk_and_return:_an_introduction#Specific types of risk|shortfall risk]]. They created equal-weighted portfolios from a universe of 1000 stocks, consisting of the 100 largest companies in each of 10 industries, covering 82% of the capitalization of the total market. They calculate ending wealth distributions for random buy-and-hold portfolios of varying numbers of stocks. Using a 1% chance of underperforming US Treasuries over that time period as criterion, they state that at least 164 stocks are needed.

In the context of the present discussion, a more apt comparison might be with the return of a cap-weighted index fund covering that universe. For nearest comparison purposes, the 20-year cumulative return of the MSCI US Large and Mid cap index&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.msci.com/our-solutions/indexes/index-resources/index-performance| title=Index Performance| publisher=MSCI}}&lt;/ref&gt; turned one dollar invested over that same period into $11.96, for an annualized return of 13.2%. Looking at Figure 3 of their paper (Wealth per dollar of initial investment), it can be seen that a 30-stock portfolio had just over a 50% chance of beating the index, a 50-stock portfolio over 55%, and a 100-stock portfolio about a 65% chance. These results presumably reflect the effect of a small-cap premium within the 1000-stock universe.

These results do not consider costs. If a cost advantage of 0.5%/year is expected from individual stocks over an index fund tracking the index, the ending value of one dollar in the index with an annualized return of 12.7% (= 13.2%-0.5%) becomes $10.94, at which point a 20-stock portfolio has a greater than 50% chance of beating the index fund. A 30-stock portfolio then has close to a 60% chance of coming out ahead, a 50-stock portfolio better than 65%, and a 100-stock portfolio has better than 75% chance of outperforming the index fund.

Of course, the magnitude of possible shortfalls should also be taken into consideration. Figure 3 shows how that magnitude grows with decreasing numbers of stocks.

===Summary===
In general, the answer to "how many stocks are recommended?" is, of course, as many as practically possible. Holding fewer stocks increases unsystematic risk and the effect of skewness on final portfolio value. Holding stocks in equal weights can pick up some small-cap premium, but remember that this also increases volatility. There is no free lunch.

As a rule, reducing the number of stocks held is always a negative when it comes to risk/reward ratio. Lower costs, from reduced expense ratios and increased tax savings, are the only guaranteed benefit. The trick is to figure out where the benefit balances out the increased risk. This is a personal decision.

==Portfolio construction==

===How to choose stocks?===
Some potentially useful factors to consider in choosing stocks are:
* Size (capitalization)
* Value (book-to-market ratio)
* Industry (at least early on)
* Liquidity (for smaller stocks)
* Dividend rate (for tax management purposes)

Size and value loadings and industry classification are of interest if you are trying to match or tilt away from market weights. Size and value are established [[Fama-French three-factor model analysis|Fama-French risk factors]], which some investors like to [[Value tilting - stock|tilt]] towards or away from. Dale Domian, David Louton and Marie Racine (see [[#Dale Domian, David Louton and Marie Racine|above]]) found that diversification across industries helped reduce dispersion of returns for small portfolio sizes, though it becomes less important for larger numbers of stocks held. Industry classification may also be of interest if you already have too much exposure to the risk of a certain industry through work, and want to reduce your portfolio's exposure to that industry. Low liquidity can be a problem in very small-cap stocks, leading to larger bid-ask spreads. Dividend yield may be of interest if you want to minimize your current taxable income.

Some other factors which have support in the academic literature are momentum, profitability, and low-beta. If you are interested in pursuing these tilts you may find individual stocks can do this, in the absence of easily-available index funds that incorporate those tilts.

If the Efficient Market Hypothesis holds, then reading balance sheets, shareholder reports and analyst recommendations is unnecessary and a complete waste of time. The strategy you use for deciding which exact stocks to hold should not matter -- you can neither help nor hurt yourself through choice of strategy. Random selection is a perfectly valid strategy, although it is not much trouble to select stocks from different industries so that you have a reasonable diversification across sectors and industries.

===Weighting===
The easiest way for you to buy stocks is in roughly equal weights -- for example, by buying equal-sized amounts of new stocks every month with new money. This will typically lead to a significant small-cap tilt in the portfolio if you choose stocks more or less at random. If you do not want exposure to the size factor, then David Ikenberry, Richard Shockley and Kent Womack found that weighting your stocks by relative market capitalization to yield median returns very close to the overall (capitalization-weighted) index (see [[#David Ikenberry, Richard Shockley and Kent Womack|above]]). As a practical matter, this leads to huge disparities in stock holding sizes for an individual investor, and is difficult to maintain as new money is added to the portfolio. An alternative is to buy equal dollar amounts of each stock, but weight the probability of buying a stock in proportion to its market capitalization; David Ikenberry, Richard Shockley and Kent Womack found that this generates results that are statistically indistinguishable from weighting individual holdings in proportion to market cap.

===Tracking error===
With smaller portfolios, you will experience "tracking error". This is the effect in which your returns in any one period differ from the entire market. While your long-term returns should be similar to the market, in any individual period you will see differences. The best example of this is when comparing US stock returns to international stock returns. Both may have the same long-term returns, but in any one year the returns will certainly differ.

If you compare international returns to a US benchmark index, you will see a difference each year and that would be tracking error. If you build a portfolio of US large cap stocks and compares the yearly results to the S&amp;P 500, you will see a difference each year. Over the long-term the cumulative results should be similar, but in any given year there will be a difference. Ronald Surz and Mitchell Price address tracking error and they indicate that random portfolios of 15 stocks should expect a tracking error of 8.1%, which reduces to 6.2% for a 30-stock portfolio and 5.3% for a 60 stock portfolio. They also indicate that by constructing the portfolio with a focus on balance among industries will reduce the tracking error to 5.4% (15 stocks), 4.2% (30 stocks) and 3.5% (60 stocks).

Tracking error is harmless to the disciplined long-term investor. Over time, you will generate the same cumulative returns as your benchmark index since your portfolio has the same risk characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.indexuniverse.com/publications/journalofindexes/joi-articles/12927-index-variation-and-overall-portfolio-performance.html| title=Looking at how different indexes affect performance| author=Craig Israelsen| publisher=JOI| date=October 2012| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190117214451/https://www.etf.com/publications/journalofindexes/joi-articles/12927-index-variation-and-overall-portfolio-performance.html| archive-date=January 17, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some investors may be alarmed to see tracking error, especially in years when their small portfolio underperforms the benchmark index.

===Transaction costs===
To minimize transaction costs (commissions and bid-ask spreads), it is best to avoid turnover as much as possible. For example, if you are considering [[tax loss harvesting]] then you should only do this if your tax benefit significantly outweighs your transaction costs.

One of the results that Dale Domian, David Louton and Marie Racine ([[#Dale Domian, David Louton and Marie Racine|above]]) found was that rebalanced portfolios have lower terminal wealth dispersions. However, besides incurring extra transaction costs, rebalancing systematically would create immediate taxable gains, so it is probably best avoided outside of a commission-free and tax-free situation. An exception might be if a single stock grows to become a significant fraction of the size of the portfolio all by itself; in this case, selling off some losing positions along with paring down the excess position can help minimize the tax impact.

==Tax management==
{{See also | Specific identification of shares}}

If you have individual stocks, you can cherry-pick the big winners and the big losers for tax management, while the index fund investor can only choose to buy, sell or donate the fund at today's [[net asset value]] (NAV) (which reflects the net of winners and losers). The individual stock investor will cherry-pick out the largest gainers and use those for more tax-efficient donations.

For example, if you plan to donate $2,000 to a charity, you can donate shares worth $2,000 (with a cost basis of $500) and pay no capital gains tax on that appreciation. The alternative is to sell the shares, realize a capital gain of $1,500 and pay $225 in income tax, leaving less money for charity or other purposes.

Another alternative is to gift highly appreciated shares to children. The child can often sell the shares and pay no capital gains tax, or pay tax at a lower rate than the parent. Donating or gifting the biggest gainers helps to [[Rebalancing|rebalance]] the portfolio, so that the largest holdings do not further impair diversification.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;US investors with charitable desires have a number of additional options for bequests outside of direct gifting. These can include establishing s [[Donor advised fund|donor advised fund]]
 for deferred gifting, or if an income from the contributed asset is still desired, from a [[Split-interest gifts|split-interest gift]], which could include the following:
* [[Charitable gift annuity]]
* [[Charitable pooled income fund]]
* [[Charitable remainder trust]] &lt;/ref&gt;

When death is imminent or foreseen, holding appreciated stocks may be useful, because appreciated assets qualify for a [[Step-up in basis| step-up in basis]] to market value, which greatly reduces, or even eliminates, the beneficiary's tax liability upon sale. 

If you hold taxable accounts, you may want to minimize the [[Dividend|dividend yield]] for tax efficiency, as realizing appreciation through capital gains is often more tax efficient than realizing the stock returns through dividends.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;For US passive investors in the lower tax brackets, like capital gains, annual streams of qualified dividends are taxed at zero percent. However, these dividends are still subject to state income tax. Capital gains can be deferred until the stock is sold.&lt;/ref&gt; An index investor must accept the dividend from the portfolio held by the index fund, while an individual stocks investor might prefer low-dividend or no-dividend stocks for their portfolio (as a general proposition, value stocks pay higher dividends than growth stocks).&lt;ref group="note"&gt; Vanguard value and growth index funds show the basic tendency of value stocks to provide higher dividends than growth stocks. See [[Principles of tax-efficient fund placement#Notes | Principles of tax-efficient fund placement]] for data. &lt;/ref&gt; A note of caution - it is not realistic to construct a portfolio with a 0.0% dividend yield, since there are not enough no-dividend companies in diverse industries and sectors to build a reasonably diversified portfolio. 

As noted above, the most powerful tax management tool is [[tax loss harvesting]], and if you hold individual stocks you can cherry-pick the losers from your portfolio and sell them for tax losses. You can use tax losses to offset capital gains, or (preferably) as a deduction against ordinary income of up to $3,000 per year. If your tax losses are greater than $3,000, you can carry over the remainder to be used in the following years. Unused carryover tax losses only expire after the death of the stockholder.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Capital losses and carry over losses (the $3,000 annual limit) must be deducted on a decedent's final tax return and remaining carryover losses cannot be carried over in the following years. See [http://www.irs.gov/publications/p544/ch04.html#en_US_publink100072659 Publication 544, Sales and Other Dispositions of Assets], IRS &lt;/ref&gt;

Controlling - meaning avoiding or minimizing - capital gains is also a tax management strategy. Tax losses are most valuable when you use them to reduce your ordinary income. These tax loss benefits typically accrue at higher tax rates, up to the maximum tax rate. When and if you generate any capital gains, these gains cancel out your banked tax losses, and this benefit is only at the capital gains rate (typically only 15%). 

You can minimize capital gains using several tactics. An index mutual fund must sell shares when the company is removed from the benchmark index, but an individual investor is not forced to sell for that reason. As a result, an individual stock investor can realize a lower turnover and lower capital gains. If you use charitable donations to help rebalance, this also serves to minimize realized capital gains. Using new money to help rebalance is another strategy to minimize realizing capital gains.

Although it is possible to manage realizing gains, it is probably not practical to assume the individual stock investor will never have capital gains, as companies are periodically taken over in cash transactions. In addition, it may be worth realizing capital gains if rebalancing is truly necessary and there are no other viable alternatives (such as using new money or charitable donations). 

After many years of tax management, you might end up with a portfolio with some shares that have little appreciation and some with greater appreciation. Those with little appreciation are perfect candidates to use in situations where you have a cash flow need, but want to avoid moving into a higher tax bracket. You can sell shares with little or no gain for cash flow without any impact on income taxes. In that sense, selling those stocks is identical to withdrawing funds from a Roth IRA.

==Record keeping==
The minimum records that you need to keep are the same as those for index funds: cost basis and date of each purchased lot, for eventual tax reporting purposes. For tax management purposes, it is also helpful to track your current unrealized gain or loss. The records your brokerage maintains may be enough.

If you want to track your performance against an index fund, it is straightforward to add an automatic lookup for the current price of that fund, and have the spreadsheet calculate how much a particular lot is worth as compared to what the same amount of money invested in the index fund would have been worth.

What is not so straightforward is accounting for dividends. If your dividend yield is similar to that of the fund, then comparing prices only may be sufficient. Otherwise, differences in dividend yield between the portfolio and the index fund will contribute to (apparent) tracking error. If this is a concern, you may need to manually account for dividends.

===US taxpayers abroad===
A US taxpayer abroad will need to keep this information in two different currencies. A convenient way to do this is to set up a spreadsheet with a line for each lot, with columns for purchase date and cost in the currency used for purchase, number of shares, exchange rate, and a calculated column for the purchase price in the other currency. Current prices and exchange rates can generally be automatically updated from the internet, and current gain or loss for each position automatically calculated in both currencies.

A little knowledge of spreadsheet programming is required, but once set up, the majority of the ongoing maintenance is just to add a new line whenever a new purchase is made. When a stock is sold or is delisted, the "current price" can be frozen to the sale or final price, and the line moved to a different area of the spreadsheet for historical tracking purposes. If a stock splits, you will need to update the number of shares.

The concept applies for savings towards any goal, such as retirement, purchasing a home, or saving for an education. The longer the timeframe, the larger the impact of the power of compounding.

If you start late, you can still catch up. However, you will need to invest more money, as compounding has much less time to have an effect.
{{blockquote|Compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world. He who understands it, earns it ... he who doesn't ... pays it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/76863-compound-interest-is-the-eighth-wonder-of-the-world-he |title=Quote by Albert Einstein: "Compound interest is ..."| accessdate=February 4, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;|Albert Einstein}}

==Compound interest==
{{See also|Wikipedia:Compound interest|l1=Compound interest - Wikipedia}}
Compound interest is interest added to the principal of a deposit or loan so that the ''added interest'' also earns interest from then on. This addition of interest to the principal is called ''compounding''. A bank account, for example, may have its interest compounded every year: in this case, an account with $1,000 initial principal and 5% interest per year would have a balance of $1,050 at the end of the first year, $1,102.50 at the end of the second year, $1,157.63 at the end of the third year, and so on.

==How much more will you get if you start early?==
If you invest $6,000 at the beginning of each year&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141128141326/http://vanguardblog.com:80/2011/12/12/need-proof/|archive-date=2014-11-28|title=Need proof? | publisher=Vanguard Blog|author=Charu Chander Gross|date=December 12, 2011|url=http://vanguardblog.com:80/2011/12/12/need-proof/|access-date=2023-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; (the equivalent of $500 per month, but placed at the beginning of the year for easier calculations), and start at age 55, assuming 4% annualized nominal return,&lt;ref group="note"&gt; The 114-year historical record of global stock and bond returns suggests that a globally balanced stock/bond portfolio will likely provide an annualized compound real return between 3% and 4%, assuming minimal expenses and no tax expense. See [https://blbarnitz4.wordpress.com/2015/02/12/global-investment-portfolios-2015-update/ Global investment portfolios 2015 update], from our site's unofficial (transferred) blog.&lt;/ref&gt; your balance at age 65 will be about $75,000. If you start at age 40, you will end up with about $260,000. And if you start at age 25 your balance at age 65 will be about $593,000.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Calculations are done as:&lt;br&gt;
Starting at age 25: 592,959.22 = FV(4%, 65-25, -6000,0,1)&lt;br&gt;
The last parameter of FV has Type set to 1, which represents a payment due at the beginning of the period.&lt;/ref&gt; The graph below illustrates this.

[[File:Saving-early-graph6.jpg|600px|border]]

To better understand what is going on, we can separate the amount invested in total from the growth of the invested money at 4% interest. Refer to the figure below.

Going from right to left, the lower (gray) bars represent your contributions. The sooner you start to invest, the more money you will have at retirement.

Now, look at the top (black) bars. Going from right to left, the sooner you start to invest, compounded interest has more time to work. Stated another way, the effect of compounding at age 20 will contribute much more significantly to your savings than contributions made later on.

[[File:Saving-early-graph2.jpg|600px|border]]

==What does it take to catch up if you start late?==
Suppose you want $100,000 at age 65, and the interest rate is again 4%. If you start at age 25, you will need to save only about $1,000 a year. At age 40, you will need to save about $2,300 a year. And if you start at age 55, the amount needed is over $8,000 per year.

[[File:Saving-early-graph4.jpg|500px|border]]

The total amount needed to reach $100,000 at age 65 also increases as the saving period gets shorter:

      <text bytes="9702" sha1="toga18y1rl6dejuwuuginc7xh3okoxm" xml:space="preserve">'''{{PAGENAME}}''' has some specific challenges. The objective (what the money is for) and its time horizon (when you will need it) affect which securities to use.

Your [[investment policy statement]] should document your medium-term goals (like a new car, a home purchase, starting a business, and education expenses for children) next to the long-term goals like retirement. You need to understand your [[Asset_allocation#Ability.2C_willingness.2C_and_need| need, willingness and ability]] to take investment risk related to each specific goal, and choose appropriate securities. Many investors use the term "saving" instead of "investing" for anything which is not long-term investing. 

Often, investors divide their investments into buckets according to the goals and timelines, and manage each with a specific strategy. Goals with a shorter timeline need safer investing, which will restrict investments to short-term instruments such as (high yield) savings accounts, bank CDs, money market funds, and short-term treasury securities that mature by the time the funds are needed. Longer term goals can include asset classes that fluctuate in price.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.finra.org/investors/set-time-frame-your-financial-goals| title=Set a Time Frame for Your Financial Goals| publisher=FINRA| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190118081745/http://www.finra.org/investors/set-time-frame-your-financial-goals| archive-date=January 18, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==

Suppose you want to invest money for goals with a medium-term timeline in a vehicle with better return than cash, to give this money a chance to grow without taking too much risk. 

Goals with a medium-term timeline are very diverse:
* Saving for regular or anticipated purchases that you cannot easily fund from cash flow, such as expenses for household appliances, a new car, marriage, or children. 
* Medium-term investing for specific projects that are some years away. For example, a down payment for a house or setting up a small business.
* Saving for education. This is very specific; for more, see: [[:Category: Education savings| Education savings]].
* Saving for unanticipated needs for cash, such as medical bills or job loss, uses an [[emergency fund]]. The goal of the emergency fund is to give you some liquidity to cover unexpected expenses or unemployment.

When setting your [[asset allocation]] (AA) and asset location for medium-term investing, the generic guidance of the [[Bogleheads® investing start-up kit|Bogleheads investing start-up kit]] and the [[Bogleheads® investment philosophy|Bogleheads investment philosophy]] certainly applies if you correctly take the [[Asset_allocation#Ability.2C_willingness.2C_and_need| need, willingness and ability]] to take risk into account. The specific characteristics of a security will determine its suitability for a given goal.

== Elements to take into account when determining how to invest for medium-term ==

The characteristics of the project for which you are saving constrains your investment choices. What is the [[Asset_allocation#Ability.2C_willingness.2C_and_need| need, willingness and ability]] to take risk on these medium-term timeline?
* Is capital preservation crucial? Or can you risk capital to strive for higher return?
* What flexibility do you need? How firm is your project's timetable? Might you need to start the project earlier than initially planned? Can you delay it if the investment does not cover it at the target date, because of lower return or loss of value? Can you put the project off until the investment recovers? 
* What is the savings rate? Could you make up the shortfall before the target date if the value of the investment fails to perform as expected?
* What is your general approach to investing? What is your current asset allocation? 
* What particular tax considerations might you have that woul also limit (or extend) your investment choices?

== Saving/investing asset allocation options ==
Some asset classes are particularly suitable for the medium-term timeline. You need to control the duration of the investments to match the due dates of your projects, and ensure the quality is very high to avoid loss of principal. 

* '''Cash like''': Very liquid and super easy to access, guarantee on the capital (if federally insured), lower return. Examples include a checking account, money market fund, and (High Yield) (insured) savings account.
* '''Reward checking account''' (RCA): Somewhat higher return, if you are willing to put in the effort to set up and maintain to get the higher APR. 
* '''Fixed income instruments''':
** [[CD]]s and similar: Can be federally insured, will have early withdrawal penalty (EWP) if not kept to term. Buy multiple sizes to avoid breaking the full CD and paying EWP on them.
** [[EE savings bonds|US savings bonds]]: These have a one-year lockout, and an annual purchase limit.
** Short term [[United States Treasury security]] 
** Tax-Exempt [[municipal bonds]] Funds 
** [[I savings bonds]] 
* '''Funds and ETFs''': For longer timelines you can use safe (quality short-term) bond funds or ETFs, or even safe equity funds or ETFs if you can bear the risk.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;In {{forum link| p=2686420| title=Buying a house in 2-4 years; what do I do with my mutual funds}}, 
White Coat Investor commented on the transfer from an existing investment in equity to a safer option for a house down payment:
{{blockquote|
The main thing is to consider your options in the event of a huge bear market. If the market drops 50%, what will you do? Here are some choices:

# Don't buy the house and just keep renting until the stocks recover and future savings gets you back to where you want to be.
# Maybe houses will be cheaper in an economic downturn and you can still buy it with your decreased amount.
# Maybe houses will be cheaper and you can use a mortgage with &lt; 20% down, leaving your investments intact.
# Maybe you won't buy a house at all.

For some people, for whom these options aren't good choices, should sell their stocks now and put the money in CDs. But there are many people for whom these other options are very realistic alternatives. For them, keeping some or all of the money in stocks is probably okay. The expected return is higher, even if the actual return may not be.}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Looking at the timeline, it is best to convert as the due date nears, from equity to bonds, to safe fixed income instruments, and finally to cash. It may be a good idea to do this gradually.

You can also use the ideas mentioned in the [[Emergency fund#Multi-tiered emergency fund|multi-tiered emergency fund]] for medium-term investing.

== Using taxable or tax advantaged accounts ==
==== General practice: use taxable accounts ====
It is best to save for short and medium term goals in a taxable account (checking, savings, CDs, and so on). Taxable accounts do not have an annual contribution limits, and they are refillable. You can readily take out and replace money.

It is not a good idea to save for known short or medium term needs or goals in a tax-advantaged account. These accounts have annual contribution limits. While you might be able to withdraw money under special considerations,&lt;ref group="note" name="contrib"&gt;You can withdraw Roth contributions at any time, free of taxes and penalties. This is not true of gains. See: [[Roth IRA]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note" name="earning"&gt;Earnings of contributions withdrawn before the due date of that year will be taxed. See IRS Publication 590-B: [http://www.irs.gov/publications/p590b/ch02.html#en_US_2014_publink1000231057 Are Distributions Taxable?].&lt;/ref&gt; they are not refillable. That is, you cannot put the money back after an early withdrawal.

==== When to use tax advantaged account ====
{{See also|Placing cash needs in a tax-advantaged account}}
It might be advantageous and possible to use ''non-used'' tax-advantaged space with extra contributions that have a medium-term timeline. This takes advantage of valuable Roth IRA contribution space that could be lost forever if you do not contribute. Compound interest requires time and money to work. Tax-advantaged space is better than taxable space. More tax-advantaged space is better than less, so use all you can every year. The advantages are more likely if the mid-term goal is not certain. At the time of the purchase you could withdraw the extra contributions&lt;ref group="note" name="contrib" /&gt; but not the earnings&lt;ref group="note" name="earning" /&gt; from the account. (See also the description in the wiki page on [[Emergency fund#Roth IRA as an emergency fund | Roth IRA as an emergency fund]]). 

If you have a sizable taxable account, you might be able to put a cash needs requirement, such as a home down payment, in a tax-advantaged account, and so improve the overall tax efficiency of your investment portfolio.

      <text bytes="19711" sha1="bv7ulfggikhs0qsjir8oq35qkapum61" xml:space="preserve">A '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an online application that provides automated investment advice.

Most robo-advisers collect information about your [[Investment policy statement|financial goals]], investment horizon, income and other assets, and your [[risk tolerance]], by asking you to complete an online questionnaire. Based on your answers, it creates and manages an investment portfolio for you.

Robo-advisers usually aim to offer investment advice at a lower cost than traditional advisers, and in some cases require lower account minimums than traditional [[Investment adviser|investment advisers]]. There is a lot of variation in the services that robo-advisers provide, and their approaches to investing.&lt;ref name="SEC"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.sec.gov/oiea/investor-alerts-bulletins/ib_robo-advisers.html| title=Investor Bulletin: Robo-Advisers| publisher=SEC.gov| date=February 23, 2017| accessdate=August 30, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal interaction==
The amount of human interaction available to you varies from one robo-adviser to another. Some robo-advisers may let you contact an investment professional to discuss your investment needs (this hybrid of both automated and personal advice is sometimes referred to as "bionic" advice). Other robo-advisers might only offer technical support, which will limit you to relying on the information on their websites or other sources you find to answer your questions about investing.&lt;ref name="SEC" /&gt;

As with any adviser, it is very important you take the time to learn about the robo-adviser’s services, including the level of interaction with a person, and find out answers to any questions you may have. Here are a few questions to consider:
* '''Human interaction:''' How much human interaction is important to you?
** Would you like to be able to ask a person questions about your investments, the investment strategy being used, and potential risks?
** Would you like to be able to speak with a person during market events, such as periods of exceptional volatility or downturns?
** Do you prefer being able to talk in person or on a phone, or is electronic communication okay?
* '''[[Bogleheads® financial literacy project| Financial literacy]]:''' What is your level of financial literacy, especially when it comes to investing? Your ability to ask a person questions about investing (for example, about the robo-adviser’s investment strategy) may be limited and you may need to rely almost entirely on the robo-adviser’s online disclosures or other sources of information that you find on your own.
** Are you comfortable using online resources?
* '''Follow-up:''' As with a traditional adviser, you may be interested in how often you will have contact with the robo-adviser. For example, how often does the robo-adviser follow-up with clients to confirm any changes that would affect their investment choices?
** Would you have to contact the robo-adviser with any updates to your financial situation? 

==Creating a recommendation==
A robo-adviser uses information you provide to create a recommendation. As a result, a robo-adviser’s recommendation is limited by the information it requests and receives from you, typically through an online questionnaire. It is important to keep in mind that some robo-advisers may obtain and consider only limited information about you. In addition, as with traditional advisers, in many cases it will be up to you to update this information. Here are a few questions to consider:

* '''Financial goals:''' Would you use the robo-adviser for a specific financial goal (for example, retirement, buying a home, or investing for your children’s education), or to meet your overall financial needs more broadly?
** Does the robo-adviser’s recommendation take into account your purpose in using the robo-adviser?
* '''Financial situation:''' Does the robo-adviser’s recommendation take into account relevant personal financial information, given your goal?
** For example, does the robo-adviser ask for information about high interest credit card debt or student loans you may have?
** Does it take into account your bank and savings accounts?
** Does it take into account your real estate holdings, such as your home, or other investments such as retirement accounts?
** Does it take into account other assets that you have?
* '''Risk tolerance:''' How does the robo-adviser take into account your tolerance for risk? How you respond to the robo-adviser’s questions about risk can affect what portfolio the robo-adviser recommends.
**In addition to the initial makeup of your portfolio, how does your risk tolerance impact how the robo-adviser might rebalance your portfolio (for example, in the event of a market decline)?

==Investing approach==
Different robo-advisers have different approaches to investing, including different investment styles and different products offered. Some have several pre-determined portfolios of investments that they will recommend for you that you may or may not be able to customize. Some robo-advisers focus solely on a limited range of investment products, such as broad-based [[Exchange-traded fund|exchange-traded funds]], or ETFs.&lt;ref name="SEC" /&gt;

Take the time to understand how the robo-adviser develops a portfolio recommendation, and what pieces of information it uses &amp;ndash; or does not use &amp;ndash; to develop a portfolio. Here are a few questions to consider:

* '''Investment products:''' Does the robo-adviser offer a limited range of investment products, such as only ETFs?
** Are the investment products used by the robo-adviser appropriate for your goals?
* '''Portfolio limitations:''' Does the robo-adviser only offer certain limited portfolios within those investment products?
** How many different portfolios could your money possibly be invested in?
** What portfolio does the robo-adviser recommend for you and why?
* '''Account types:''' What type of accounts does the robo-adviser manage? For example, does the robo-adviser manage [[Traditional IRA|individual retirement accounts (IRAs)]]? Taxable accounts? [[401(k)|401(k) accounts]] or [[529 plan|college savings plans]]?
* '''[[Tax loss harvesting]]:''' Does the robo-adviser use tax loss harvesting? Tax loss harvesting means selling investments that have experienced losses in your account, and this may have tax implications. The value of tax loss harvesting can depend on your particular tax situation in a given year. You also have to watch out for [[Wash sale|wash sale]] rules. Make sure you understand the tax implications of any sales, and consider whether you may wish to consult a tax adviser.&lt;ref name="SEC" /&gt; Tax loss harvesting does not apply to tax-deferred accounts, such as an IRA.

==Fees and other costs==
[[Mutual funds: additional costs|Fees and other costs]] can greatly impact your return on investment. One of the main benefits of a robo-adviser is usually lower fees and costs – so it is very important that you understand what you would be charged. A robo-adviser may offer lower-cost investment advice, but if the robo-adviser uses investment products with high costs, your total overall costs could still be high. It is important to understand your total costs.

An adviser's SEC filing will show their fees (see [[#Licensing and registration|below]]).

==Licensing and registration==
Firms that provide advisory services in the U.S. are typically registered as investment advisers with either the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) or one or more state securities authorities. Although the services that they provide are automated, robo-advisers in the U.S. must comply with the securities laws applicable to SEC or state-registered investment advisers. Use the SEC’s [https://adviserinfo.sec.gov/ Investment Adviser Public Disclosure] (IAPD) database to research the background, including registration or license status and disciplinary history, of any individual or firm recommending an investment.

Like traditional investment advisers, robo-advisers are also required to file a Form ADV.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Investment advisers file Form ADV to register with the SEC and/or the states. Some advisers that are exempt from registration (Exempt Reporting Advisers) also complete a portion of the questions in Form ADV for reporting to the SEC and/or the states. All investment advisers must periodically update the information in their filings. Form ADV contains information about an investment adviser and its business operations. Form ADV also contains disclosure about certain disciplinary events involving the adviser and its key personnel. Source: [https://adviserinfo.sec.gov/ Investment Adviser Public Disclosure], from the SEC.&lt;/ref&gt; Robo-advisers may also offer certain information about their advisory business on their websites or in communications with clients. Check the robo-adviser’s website regularly to see if there is any updated information.

==Risks and limitations==
While automated investment tools may offer clear benefits &amp;ndash; including low cost, ease of use, and broad access &amp;ndash; it is important to understand their risks and limitations before using them. Investors should be wary of tools that promise better portfolio performance.&lt;ref name = "ToolTips"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.sec.gov/investment/investor-alerts-and-bulletins/autolistingtools| title=Investor Alert: Automated Investment Tools| publisher=SEC| date=May 8, 2015| accessdate=August 30, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Understand any terms and conditions.''' Review all relevant disclosures for an automated investment tool.
**Understand any terms and conditions, such as the fees and expenses associated with using the tool or with selling or purchasing investments.
**Find out how you can terminate any agreement or relationship, and how long it may take to cash out any investments if you decide to stop using the tool. If anything is unclear or you need additional information, directly contact the automated tool sponsor.
**Ask an automated investment tool sponsor whether it receives any form of compensation for offering, recommending, or selling certain services or investments. 
*'''Consider the tool’s limitations, including any key assumptions.''' Be aware that an automated tool may rely on assumptions that could be incorrect or do not apply to your individual situation. For example, an automated investment tool may be programmed to use economic assumptions that will not react to shifts in the market. If the automated tool assumes that interest rates will remain low but, instead, interest rates rise, the tool’s output will be flawed.
**In addition, an automated investment tool, like other investment programs, may be programmed to consider limited options. For example, an automated investment tool may only consider investments offered by an affiliated firm.
*'''The tool’s output directly depends on what information it seeks from you and what information you provide.''' Which questions the tool asks and how they are framed may limit or influence the information you provide, which in turn directly impacts the output that an automated investment tool generates.
** If any of the questions are unclear or you do not understand why the information is being sought, ask the tool sponsor.
** Be aware that a tool may ask questions that are over-generalized, ambiguous, misleading, or designed to fit you into the tool’s predetermined options. 
** In addition, be very careful when inputting your answers or information. If you make a mistake, the resulting output may not be right for you.
*'''The tool’s output may not be right for your financial needs or goals.''' An automated investment tool may not assess all of your particular circumstances, such as your age, financial situation and needs, investment experience, other holdings, tax situation, willingness to risk losing your investment money for potentially higher investment returns, time horizon for investing, need for cash, and investment goals. Consequently, some tools may suggest investments (including [[asset allocation]] models) that may not be right for you. 
** For example, an automated investment tool may estimate a time horizon for your investments based only on your age, but not take into account that you need some of your investment money back in a few years to buy a new home. In addition, automated tools typically do not take into account that your financial goals may change. 
** If the automated investment tool does not allow you to interact with an actual person, consider that you may lose the value that human judgment and oversight, or more personalized service, may add to the process. 
* '''Safeguard your personal information.''' Be aware that an automated tool sponsor may be collecting your personal information for purposes unrelated to the tool. Understand when and with whom your personal information may be shared. If you have questions that are not answered in the tool’s privacy policy, contact the tool’s sponsor for more information.

*Wealthfront: See this {{Forum post|p=3481224|title=Re: What we know about robo advisors}}.

==Portfolio performance==
A portfolio's performance (return over time) depends on your asset allocation, which is a balance of your [[Asset allocation#Ability, willingness, and need | ability, willingness, and need]] to take risk. The selection process is no different with a robo-adviser portfolio than one based on a "conventional" portfolio from, for example, [[Fidelity]], [[Charles Schwab|Schwab]], or [[Vanguard]].

Robo-adviser portfolios typically hold more funds than a [[Lazy portfolios|lazy portfolio]], but that does not guarantee a better return. There is a comprehensive discussion in this {{Forum post|t=224764|title=Backtesting some robo-advisers asset allocations}}.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;If you are uncomfortable using a robo-adviser, but still wish to manage your own investments, consider a [[Target date funds|target date fund]] instead. These "Set and forget" type funds have been performing "automated" investment management for quite some time - well before the advent of robo-advisers.

GnuCash allows you to track bank accounts, stocks, income and expenses. It uses double-entry accounting to ensure balanced books and accurate reports.&lt;ref name=official&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gnucash.org/|title=GnuCash offical website|accessdate=December 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; GnuCash's data file format is fully open and stores data in either an XML file (the default) or an SQL database.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wiki.gnucash.org/wiki/FAQ#Q:_Where_is_my_GnuCash_data_file.3F|title=FAQ - GnuCash|accessdate=2017-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GnuCash has versions that run on Windows, macOS, and many different flavors of Linux and BSD.&lt;ref name="GNU"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://wiki.gnucash.org/wiki/GnuCash| title=GnuCash Wiki| accessdate=December 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Programming on GnuCash began in 1997, and its first stable release was in 1998. Small Business Accounting was added in 2001. A Mac installer became available in 2004. A Windows port was released in 2007.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gnucash.org/oldnews.phtml |publisher=gnucash.org |title=GnuCash - Older Announcements|accessdate=December 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; An Apple Silicon version was made available on July 16, 2024.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lists.gnucash.org/pipermail/gnucash-devel/2024-July/046942.html |publisher=gnucash.org |title=Announcement: GnuCash 5.8 For Apple Silicon |accessdate=July 23, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2012, the development of GnuCash for Android was announced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.codinguser.com/2012/05/gnucash-mobile/| title=Gnucash Mobile| date=May 10, 2012| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120516071603/http://www.codinguser.com/2012/05/gnucash-mobile/| archive-date=May 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is an expense-tracking companion app for GnuCash, as opposed to a stand-alone accounting package.

== Main features ==
GnuCash's main features include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gnucash.org/features.phtml|title=GnuCash Features|accessdate=December 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Double entry accounting. Every transaction must debit one account and credit others by an equal amount. This ensures the books balance, so that the difference between income and expenses exactly equals the sum of assets and liabilities.
* A checkbook-style register, including split transactions, autofill and the ability to mark a transaction cleared or reconciled.
* Scheduled transactions.
* Reports and graphs. An integrated module to display graphs of your financial data as barcharts, pie charts,  and scatter plots. GnuCash also comes complete with a full suite of standard and customizeable reports, including a balance sheet, profit and loss statement, and portfolio valuation.
* Statement reconciliation. This lets you compare the transactions entered in an account against a bank statement.
* [[Stock]], [[bond]], and [[mutual fund]] accounts.
* Small-business accounting.
* Quicken Interchange Format (QIF) and Open Financial Exchange (OFX) import. If you are migrating from other financial software, GnuCash can import Intuit® Quicken® QIF files using a practical assistant.

==Quicken to GnuCash conversion==
{{Cleanup section|small=no|reason=Does not conform to wiki standards (reference [[w:Wikipedia:Manual of Style|Wikipedia:Manual of Style]]).}}
[https://www.quicken.com/ Quicken] is a commercial personal finance management program. This section describes how Quicken owners can import their existing data into GnuCash.

The following are steps recorded while converting an existing Quicken 2016 file (with a 20-year history) into GnuCash so that the account hierarchy and account history transfers from Quicken to GnuCash. These steps may not apply to everyone (they depend on how you used Quicken in the past). If you find any information that is inaccurate, or if you have new information, please post a suggestion in this {{Forum post | t=234157|title=Experiences with Quicken to GNUCash Conversion}}.

=== Before you start ===
Before you start, it might be good to learn about GnuCash and its accounting philosophy (double entry accounting). The [https://www.gnucash.org/viewdoc.phtml?doc=guide GnuCash Tutorial and Concepts Guide] is a great resource to start.
* The key concept to digest is the fact that &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; is an account in GnuCash, and &lt;em&gt;every transaction&lt;/em&gt; is a transfer from one account to another. For example, if you spend $100 on clothes, it is recorded as a transfer from your credit card account to the Expenses/Clothing account. Similarly, a paycheck is a transfer from your "Income/salary" account to other accounts specified on your paycheck.

=== Preparations for conversion ===
On the Quicken end, save a copy of your QDF file ("Save a copy as ..." option) and use that copy as the source for your conversion. Make sure to not run any updates (including Quote Updates) on that QDF copy. This is a good way to ensure that you do not accidentally update your QDF source file during the whole conversion process. If you update the QDF file before completing the conversion, you will have no way to check if the account balances and transactions match between Quicken and GnuCash.

As of November 2017, the GnuCash QIF importer does not handle the following cases correctly, and must be fixed in Quicken first:
* If the input QIF file has stock option transactions such as vest, expire, exercise, and so on, the QIF importer errors out with an exception. The workaround would be to modify the account in question to remove these transactions and convert them to "regular" stock transactions like sold or bought. This may look a bit strange, because you are buying stock out of thin air (your cash balance will be negative after the bought transaction), but in the end it works out (the cash balance becomes positive after the stock is sold off at a profit). 

GnuCash can import Quicken data using the QIF format. To ensure that you have &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; (including categories and payees) in your Quicken account exported, use the "File-&gt;File Export-&gt;QIF File ..." menu in Quicken and check that:
* Everything is checked under "Include in Export" box.
* "All Accounts" is selected in the "Quicken Account to Export From" box.
* The date range covers your entire history on Quicken.
An example is shown below:

[[File:quicken-qif-export.png]]

You can use the saved QIF file for GnuCash import.

=== Conversion ===
The following are steps that worked for me. The conversion wizard may take a different path depending on your individual situation and account types -- use your best judgement on such cases:
* Open GnuCash, create a new file ("File -&gt; New File"), and cancel the "New Account Hierarchy Setup" wizard.
* Select "File -&gt; Import -&gt; Import QIF" and click "Forward" on the wizard.
* In the next screen, select the QIF file that was exported from Quicken and click "Forward".
* Click "Start". The converter would start parsing transactions from the QIF file. Keep monitoring the text box beneath for any warnings. No warnings means your input file is good. Otherwise, you might need to adjust the source Quicken data file in such a way to make the warnings go away (one example was the stock option exercise or vest transactions that was pointed out in the previous section). Click "Forward" once the processing is complete.
* In the next two screens, Quicken will show account names for each individual account &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; category in the incoming Quicken file. Check if everything is OK and click "Forward".
** GnuCash will also call out uncategorized transactions and will request you to find the matching GnuCash account names (that is, "categories" in Quicken). Fix as needed.
* Select "USD" for currency and click "Forward".
* In the next few screens, GnuCash will ask you to enter information about all tradeable securities it found in the Quicken file. Just make sure that the name, ticker symbol and exchange (NYSE, NASDAQ, FUND ...) are correct and fix if incorrect. This will be useful once we start auto-updating quotes.
** Note: This may take a while depending on how many securities there are in your Quicken account.
* In the final dialog that comes up after all securities are entered, you can either choose to leave everything at default, or go over the options and change anything as needed.
* Finally, you will see a "QIF Import" dialog with a "Start Import" button. Click to start importing.
** This is the core part of the conversion process, where GnuCash will create new accounts and try to match transactions across accounts. This may take a while depending on the length of your Quicken history.
* Click "Apply" once the process is done. This will conclude the import Wizard.
The account balances and net worth shown by GnuCash is unlikely to be correct (that is, it probably will not match Quicken balances and net-worth). Go over the post conversion notes to fix issues with the import.

==== Troubleshooting ====
In any step above, if the QIF importer abruptly fails or crashes, one option to proceed would be to enable tracing and running GnuCash in "debug" mode; this generates a lot of helpful logging information. See [https://wiki.gnucash.org/wiki/Tracefile Tracefile - GnuCash] for more information about trace file logging and locations.

=== Post-conversion notes ===
As of November 2017, because of unresolved issues with the QIF importer, you may need the following post-conversion actions (these are what I found, but there may be more depending on how complex or long your Quicken history is).
* If the input QIF file has stock option transactions such as vest, expire, exercise, and so on, the QIF importer errors out with an exception. The workaround would be to modify the account in question to remove these transactions and convert them to "regular" stock transactions like sold or bought. This may look a bit strange, because you are buying stock out of thin air (your cash balance will be negative after the bought transaction), but in the end it works out (the cash balance becomes positive after the stock is sold off at a profit). 
* The QIF importer does not handle "Empty-ish" paychecks correctly. These are paychecks where the entire incoming salary is transferred out to other accounts (via paycheck deductions), so that there is no balance left to deposit into the primary checking account which has the paycheck transactions recorded. For such paychecks, the QIF importer completely reverses the direction of all the split transactions in the paycheck. These need to be fixed post import.
** These errors are actually easy to detect. We just need to look at the "Salary" ledger and review any items in the "Charge" column. Ideally, all the items in the "Salary" account's ledger must be in the "Income" column. Identify any transactions in the "Charge" column and fix them on a case-by-case basis.
* Load accounts are incorrectly initialized. Ideally, the House "Asset" account must have the transfers from the bank (for down payment), and from the Mortgage Loan account (for the loan amount). At the end of import, in the "Loan" accounts ledger the loan's initial balance is categorized as "Retained Earnings" which does not make any sense at all. Fix the initialization to match the ideal expectation of initializing a house purchase and mortgage loan.
* At the end of import, the prices of all imported securities will be $0. This will cause a big difference between the Quicken and the GnuCash balance. Go to each security, find the corresponding price in Quicken and do a manual update of the price in GnuCash. 
* At this point, all account balances between Quicken and GnuCash would match unless there is another problem that isn't covered by the above.
* One more weird thing I noticed that needed fixing was the fact that all "investor" -&gt; "admiral" share conversions were handled by transfers into "Equity::Retained Earnings" account. Following the GnuCash convention, the "Equity::Retained Earnings" account is used to record account opening balances (that is, balances that existed before starting GnuCash accounting and had no history). The "sale" of the investor shares were recorded as direct share transfer (without a price) while the "purchase" of the admiral shares were recorded as "buy" transactions (with an associated price) with the Equity::Retained Earnings account as the source of funds. This caused an imbalance in the final Equity::Retained Earnings balance.
** There are multiple ways to fix this. For simplicity, since I do not care about the cost basis of these shares (they are in retirement accounts), I simply deleted the existing transactions that recorded the conversion and used a single "sell" transaction in the investor share account and a single "buy" transaction in the admiral share account (the prices should be available in the transaction history provided by the custodian). Once I was done with this, the "Equity::Retained Earnings" account had a very small final balance that only reflected the account opening balances for accounts that were open prior to starting any kind of Quicken/MS Money/GnuCash accounting.

=== Account organization ===
Once import is complete, it may be worth spending some time to organize accounts into an account hierarchy. First, decide on what account hierarchy makes sense in your case. The following is one example:
{| class="wikitable"
|
* Assets
** Real Estate
*** House
** Investments
*** Retirement
*** Taxable
*** 529
* Banking
** Checking
*** Bank of America
** Savings
*** Ally Bank
* Credit Cards
** American Express
* Equity (GnuCash creates this automatically).
* Expenses
** Bills
** Dining Out
** ...
* Income
** Salary
** Dividends
** Capital Gains
* Loans
** Mortgage
|}
Then, start creating accounts at each level matching the hierarchy (note: &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; is an account is GnuCash). Once you have created the top-level accounts, right-click on the top-level account, select "New Account ...", fill in the details for the account and save it. You can also move existing accounts imported from Quicken, by right-clicking on them, selecting "Edit Account" and then choosing an appropriate parent account in the account hierarchy. You can modify the account hierarchy any number of times without any side-effects.

One more thing to ensure when organizing accounts would be to make sure all accounts are of correct type (refer to the GnuCash tutorial for types and descriptions).

==Quickbooks to GnuCash conversion==
A guide on converting from quickbooks to GNUCash is available at Github: [https://github.com/erikmack/qb-escape QuickBooks -&gt; GnuCash migration scripts from LWN].

One Boglehead forum user's experience is that the sample.QIF file provided did not work and created only a lock file and no output, but it does work on exports from Quickbooks 2021 Desktop for Windows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://github.com/erikmack/qb-escape/issues/5| title=Scripts not working with Python 3.11.9 on MacOS 14.5| publisher=GitHub| accessdate=July 26, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text bytes="5056" sha1="c8d74y47l1rnccxpvpofpii3tb95h69" xml:space="preserve">'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a method to value the asset. It is similar to moving average method. The moving average method takes the arithmetic average 5 days of market value. The result 'moves' depending on the valuation date. Linear smoothing instead recognizes the gains and loss due to investment return over time. Over 4 years, it would recognize 25% from last year, 50% from two years prior, 75% from three years prior and 100% from 4 years prior. The purpose of the method is two folds. It reduces overreliance on current market value and it reduces the volatility of the resulting valuation. 
==Calculation==
The linear smoothing as approved by ERISA (automatic Approval 15 &lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |url=http://www.soa.org/library/newsletters/pension-forum/2002/september/pfn0209.pdf |title=Asset Valuation Methods under ERISA |date= September 2002 |website= |publisher= Society of Actuaries, Pension forum, volume 14, number 1|access-date= |last= Paulette Tino and Edward Sypher|first= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;) adjusts for a single year of expected returns. The example below use 7% expected returns and contributions at mid-year using compounded interest. The gains and loss at 12/31 for Year 1 is (-8,480) = 196,500 – 204,980. Of this, 75% is recognized and 25 % is unrecognized (-2,120) = (-8,480) * 25%. The linear smoothed value is the Market value at Year 4 less the sum of past unrecognized gains and loss 287,704 = 228,000 – (-2,120 + -5,781 + -51,803).

==Desirable characteristics==
There are many types of method to value asset each with their own merits and faults. For example, current market value, book value or moving average. The desirable characteristics of an asset valuation method should be&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cia-ica.ca/docs/default-source/2014/214100e.pdf |title=Guidance on Asset Valuation Methods |date=September 2014  |website= |publisher=Canadian Institute of Actuaries |access-date= |last= |first= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Achieves objectives
* Tracks to market value
* Does not unduly deviate from market value
* Has a reasonable and logical relationship to market value
* Is generally free of any bias
* Has no undue influence on investment transaction decisions or vice versa
* Is consistent with the length of typical economic cycles

==Phase-in==
Making change in a valuation method is not to be taken lightly. It should only happen infrequently and with care. Instead of retroactively applying the method to year before the valuation method is change, we can apply a phase-in period. Say in the previous example year 2 was when the linear smoothing valuation method was selected. Year 2 market value as of 1/1 would be fully recognized. The linear smoothing with phase-in as of Year 2 would rather be 285,584 = 228,000 – (-8,480 * 0% + -11,563 * 50% + -69,071 * 25%).

==Corridor==
In order to keep a closer relationship to market value, corridor can be implemented. Any linear smoothed value above 120% of the current Market Value(MV) and under 80% would be capped at 80% * MV or 120% * MV. This corridor strategy will help achieve better tracking to market value and recognize faster major change in market valuation.

==Controversy==
The smoothing of asset is the subject of many articles against it&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |url=http://sfmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sfarchive/2003/08/Provocative-Pension-Accounting.pdf |title=Provocative Pension Accounting |date=August 2003  |website= Strategic Finance Magazine|publisher=Institute of Management Accountants |access-date= |last=Hope |first=Ole-Kristian |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://iveybusinessjournal.com/publication/pension-accounting-the-end-of-smoothing/ |title=Pension accounting the end of smoothing|date=April 2005  |website= Ivey Business Jouranl|publisher=Ivey Business School |access-date= |last=Wiedman|first=Christine |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The main concerns are : transparency issue, time lagging issue, manipulation issue. The method is less transparent than market value. It can confuse the unaware observer. Any gains and loss are recognize through time. This means that the 2008 crash is recognized between 2009 to 2014. During 2010-2014, it surprises the unaware observer that the value of asset diminish while investment were up during the last year.  Finally, actively changing the valuation method to best fit our objective as time past, brings an unwanted bias in our asset valuation.

      <text bytes="6449" sha1="95sfpkq1oa0kbra9qt35s9vy208wb0n" xml:space="preserve">'''{{PAGENAME}}''' compares a '''saving rate''' with Return on Investment (ROI), to understand its impact on your financial goals.

Investors often focus primarily on [[asset allocation]], expenses associated with investments (such as transaction fees and [[expense ratios]]), tax efficiency (types of account), sector allocation, active vs passive, and so on, to maximize their return on investment to reach a financial goal. The [[importance of saving early]] is also well documented.

Beyond these, though, achieving your financial goals relies on a combination of market returns and the amount you save over time (that is, your ''saving rate'').

==Saving rate==
Your saving rate is the percentage of your income that you save towards a financial goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/savings-rate.asp |title=Savings Rate: Definition, Influences, History in the U.S.| date=May 12, 2023 |publisher=Investopedia| accessdate=August 25, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To put the saving rate into perspective, suppose two investors Alice and Bob each have $100,000 in income, and each saves a percentage of their income consistently for 30 years.
* Alice saves 4% of her income ($4,000), and her return on investment on saving is 6%. After 30 years, she has $316,233.
* Bob saves 6% of his income ($6,000), but his return on investment on saving is only 4%. After 30 years, he has $336,510. His higher saving rate has more than overcome his lower return on investments.

Increasing your saving rate is particularly important when the return on investments is low. However if return on investments is very high, then the impact of saving rate becomes relatively less important. Alternately, if your saving rate is less than 4%, the saving rate you use has a huge impact on the end balance, when compared the rate of return.

Table 1 below helps to show the relationship between ''saving rate'' and ''return on investment'' for a given saving rate. For example, with a saving rate of 1%, you need a 12% return on investment to save $241,334. In contrast, for a saving rate of 2%, a return slightly over 8% is enough to achieve the same end balance of $241,334.

In investing, we make personal choices about how much [[Risk and return: an introduction|risk]] we are willing to take if we think we can get higher return in exchange. '''{{PAGENAME}}''' compares historical performance of similar funds that are appropriate for [[short-term]] savings.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt; John Bogle, in his 1994 classic, ''Bogle on Mutual Funds'', suggested using a low-cost short-term treasury bond fund, with its government backed credit rating, as a prudent substitute for a money market fund for investment reserves distinct from savings and transaction account balances. (p.132 in the text)&lt;/ref&gt;

Volatility--fluctuations in value--are an important aspect of risk. In financial economics, volatility is often measured by a statistical value called the [[wikipedia:Standard deviation| standard deviation]], represented by the Greek letter ''sigma'' (σ). The standard deviation of mutual funds can be found on sites like [http://www.morningstar.com Morningstar] or [https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/fund-performance PortfolioVisualizer]. However, it is hard to relate this number to a practical question, like "how much risk would I be taking by putting money I need a year from now into a short-term bond fund instead of a money market fund?" This article tries to help with this kind of question.

==Overview==
In this article, we calculate some other measures of risk by calculating what would have happened to an investment of $10,000, held for short periods of time, in a [[mutual fund]] or [[exchange-traded fund]] (ETF). You might do this in hope of making more than you would have made in a money market mutual fund, and accepting the possibility of sometimes making less.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt; For funds and ETFs, calculations are based on data made publicly available free of charge from [https://www.morningstar.com/ Morningstar]. Data for the CPI is CPI-U, "CPI for All Urban Consumers," not seasonally adjusted, obtained from the [https://www.bls.gov/ Bureau of Labor Statistics].&lt;/ref&gt; The possibility of making less is depicted in two ways:

1) What ''percentage'' of the time would you have made less than in a money market fund? We chose VMMXX, the Vanguard Prime Money Market Fund, because it is one of the oldest money market fund and gave us a long period of comparison. We also show what percentage of the time you would have actually lost money--ended up with less than $10,000 at the end of the time period--and what percentage of time you would have failed to keep up with inflation.

2) It's important to know not just when a fund or ETF underperformed a money market mutual fund, but by how much. In the case of short-term funds, the losses, when they did occur, were so small that some might call them negligible To quantify this, we present two numbers. One is the average loss that occurred ''in those periods in which losses did occur;'' and the other is the largest loss that ever occurred within the body of data that was used.

Notice that a high probability of underperforming may not be important at all. If two investments have the same return and volatility, but just fluctuate randomly with respect to each other, you would expect each of them to underperform the other about 50% of the time. 

We have chosen to present data going back for as far as Morningstar has data. As a result, there are two caveats. First, the data range shown for each fund is different and results for different funds cannot be directly compared. For example, the Vanguard Short-Term Treasury Fund, VFISX, beat VMMXX by an average of $117.10 while the Vanguard Short-Term Treasury ''Index'' fund, VGSH, only beat it by $33.17. But this is almost entirely due to VGSH's inception in 2009 versus VFISX's inception in 1991. If we restrict our view of VFISX to the same years as VGSH, the benefit for VFISX was only $44.05. Second, this underlines the problem with all historical data, which is that the present time--and thus the short-term future--may be quite different from the historical averages.

===Median and average (mean)===
We show both the average and the median for some key values. A reader requested this. We have a scattered group of values: the return from an investment over many different periods of time. To represent the center of such a group with a single number, we often calculate and average or mean. In the case here, when we are looking, for example, at losses, and only seeing "the tail of the distribution," the average may give the wrong impression because it's influenced by extreme values. The median is another measure, and represents the value that is halfway based on counting. If the median loss of an investment is $600, it means you had a 50% chance of losing more over $600 and a 50% chance of losing less than $600.

===Holding bond funds for the average "duration" of the fund===
A "duration" is a calculation based on bond math that gives a number of years, related to the bond's term but shorter. One interpretation of the duration is that it is the "point of indifference." It is too well known that when interest rates rise, bond values fall. What is less well known is that if a bond is held for its duration, at the end of that period of time it will have the same value regardless of what interest rates do, provided the yield curve moves in parallel. This does not apply to a bond ''fund'' because the bonds in a fund are all different "ages" at any given time, and because the yield curve doesn't move in parallel. So there are no guarantees, but, nevertheless, the duration tells us a holding period over which the fund is unlikely to lose money.

This leads us to expect, for example, that "short-term" bond funds--like the Vanguard Short-Term Bond Index Fund, with a duration of 2.7 years--will sometimes lose money over periods of 6 or 12 months, but rarely lose money over periods of 5 years. This expectation is borne out by history.

A bond fund may not lose money, in the sense of dollars, yet lose value to inflation.

In investing, we make personal choices about how much [[Risk and return: an introduction|risk]] we are willing to take if we think we can get higher return in exchange. '''{{PAGENAME}}''' compares historical performance of similar funds that are appropriate for [[short-term]] savings.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt; John Bogle, in his 1994 classic, ''Bogle on Mutual Funds'', suggested using a low-cost short-term treasury bond fund, with its government backed credit rating, as a prudent substitute for a money market fund for investment reserves distinct from savings and transaction account balances. (p.132 in the text)&lt;/ref&gt;

Volatility--fluctuations in value--are an important aspect of risk. In financial economics, volatility is often measured by a statistical value called the [[wikipedia:Standard deviation| standard deviation]], represented by the Greek letter ''sigma'' (σ). The standard deviation of mutual funds can be found on sites like [http://www.morningstar.com Morningstar] or [https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/fund-performance PortfolioVisualizer]. However, it is hard to relate this number to a practical question, like "how much risk would I be taking by putting money I need a year from now into a short-term bond fund instead of a money market fund?" This article tries to help with this kind of question.

==Overview==
In this article, we calculate some other measures of risk by calculating what would have happened to an investment of $10,000, held for short periods of time, in a [[mutual fund]] or [[exchange-traded fund]] (ETF). You might do this in hope of making more than you would have made in a money market mutual fund, and accepting the possibility of sometimes making less.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt; For funds and ETFs, calculations are based on data made publicly available free of charge from [https://www.morningstar.com/ Morningstar]. Data for the CPI is CPI-U, "CPI for All Urban Consumers," not seasonally adjusted, obtained from the [https://www.bls.gov/ Bureau of Labor Statistics].&lt;/ref&gt; The possibility of making less is depicted in two ways:

1) What ''percentage'' of the time would you have made less than in a money market fund? We chose VMMXX, the Vanguard Prime Money Market Fund, because it is one of the oldest money market fund and gave us a long period of comparison. We also show what percentage of the time you would have actually lost money--ended up with less than $10,000 at the end of the time period--and what percentage of time you would have failed to keep up with inflation.

2) It's important to know not just when a fund or ETF underperformed a money market mutual fund, but by how much. In the case of short-term funds, the losses, when they did occur, were so small that some might call them negligible To quantify this, we present two numbers. One is the average loss that occurred ''in those periods in which losses did occur;'' and the other is the largest loss that ever occurred within the body of data that was used.

Notice that a high probability of underperforming may not be important at all. If two investments have the same return and volatility, but just fluctuate randomly with respect to each other, you would expect each of them to underperform the other about 50% of the time. 

We have chosen to present data going back for as far as Morningstar has data. As a result, there are two caveats. First, the data range shown for each fund is different and results for different funds cannot be directly compared. For example, the Vanguard Short-Term Treasury Fund, VFISX, beat VMMXX by an average of $117.10 while the Vanguard Short-Term Treasury ''Index'' fund, VGSH, only beat it by $33.17. But this is almost entirely due to VGSH's inception in 2009 versus VFISX's inception in 1991. If we restrict our view of VFISX to the same years as VGSH, the benefit for VFISX was only $44.05. Second, this underlines the problem with all historical data, which is that the present time--and thus the short-term future--may be quite different from the historical averages.

===Median and average (mean)===
We show both the average and the median for some key values. A reader requested this. We have a scattered group of values: the return from an investment over many different periods of time. To represent the center of such a group with a single number, we often calculate and average or mean. In the case here, when we are looking, for example, at losses, and only seeing "the tail of the distribution," the average may give the wrong impression because it's influenced by extreme values. The median is another measure, and represents the value that is halfway based on counting. If the median loss of an investment is $600, it means you had a 50% chance of losing more over $600 and a 50% chance of losing less than $600.

===Holding bond funds for the average "duration" of the fund===
A "duration" is a calculation based on bond math that gives a number of years, related to the bond's term but shorter. One interpretation of the duration is that it is the "point of indifference." It is too well known that when interest rates rise, bond values fall. What is less well known is that if a bond is held for its duration, at the end of that period of time it will have the same value regardless of what interest rates do, provided the yield curve moves in parallel. This does not apply to a bond ''fund'' because the bonds in a fund are all different "ages" at any given time, and because the yield curve doesn't move in parallel. So there are no guarantees, but, nevertheless, the duration tells us a holding period over which the fund is unlikely to lose money.

This leads us to expect, for example, that "short-term" bond funds--like the Vanguard Short-Term Bond Index Fund, with a duration of 2.7 years--will sometimes lose money over periods of 6 or 12 months, but rarely lose money over periods of 5 years. This expectation is borne out by history.

A bond fund may not lose money, in the sense of dollars, yet lose value to inflation.

In investing, we make personal choices about how much [[Risk and return: an introduction|risk]] we are willing to take if we think we can get higher return in exchange. '''{{PAGENAME}}''' compares historical performance of similar funds that are appropriate for [[short-term]] savings.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt; John Bogle, in his 1994 classic, ''Bogle on Mutual Funds'', suggested using a low-cost short-term treasury bond fund, with its government backed credit rating, as a prudent substitute for a money market fund for investment reserves distinct from savings and transaction account balances. (p.132 in the text)&lt;/ref&gt;

Volatility--fluctuations in value--are an important aspect of risk. In financial economics, volatility is often measured by a statistical value called the [[wikipedia:Standard deviation| standard deviation]], represented by the Greek letter ''sigma'' (σ). The standard deviation of mutual funds can be found on sites like [http://www.morningstar.com Morningstar] or [https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/fund-performance PortfolioVisualizer]. However, it is hard to relate this number to a practical question, like "how much risk would I be taking by putting money I need a year from now into a short-term bond fund instead of a money market fund?" This article tries to help with this kind of question.

==Overview==
In this article, we calculate some other measures of risk by calculating what would have happened to an investment of $10,000, held for short periods of time, in a [[mutual fund]] or [[exchange-traded fund]] (ETF). You might do this in hope of making more than you would have made in a money market mutual fund, and accepting the possibility of sometimes making less.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt; For funds and ETFs, calculations are based on data made publicly available free of charge from [https://www.morningstar.com/ Morningstar]. Data for the CPI is CPI-U, "CPI for All Urban Consumers," not seasonally adjusted, obtained from the [https://www.bls.gov/ Bureau of Labor Statistics].&lt;/ref&gt; The possibility of making less is depicted in two ways:

1) What ''percentage'' of the time would you have made less than in a money market fund? We chose VMMXX, the Vanguard Prime Money Market Fund, because it is one of the oldest money market fund and gave us a long period of comparison. We also show what percentage of the time you would have actually lost money--ended up with less than $10,000 at the end of the time period--and what percentage of time you would have failed to keep up with inflation.

2) It's important to know not just when a fund or ETF underperformed a money market mutual fund, but by how much. In the case of short-term funds, the losses, when they did occur, were so small that some might call them negligible To quantify this, we present two numbers. One is the average loss that occurred ''in those periods in which losses did occur;'' and the other is the largest loss that ever occurred within the body of data that was used.

Notice that a high probability of underperforming may not be important at all. If two investments have the same return and volatility, but just fluctuate randomly with respect to each other, you would expect each of them to underperform the other about 50% of the time. 

We have chosen to present data going back for as far as Morningstar has data. As a result, there are two caveats. First, the data range shown for each fund is different and results for different funds cannot be directly compared. For example, the Vanguard Short-Term Treasury Fund, VFISX, beat VMMXX by an average of $117.10 while the Vanguard Short-Term Treasury ''Index'' fund, VGSH, only beat it by $33.17. But this is almost entirely due to VGSH's inception in 2009 versus VFISX's inception in 1991. If we restrict our view of VFISX to the same years as VGSH, the benefit for VFISX was only $44.05. Second, this underlines the problem with all historical data, which is that the present time--and thus the short-term future--may be quite different from the historical averages.

===Median and average (mean)===
We show both the average and the median for some key values. A reader requested this. We have a scattered group of values: the return from an investment over many different periods of time. To represent the center of such a group with a single number, we often calculate and average or mean. In the case here, when we are looking, for example, at losses, and only seeing "the tail of the distribution," the average may give the wrong impression because it's influenced by extreme values. The median is another measure, and represents the value that is halfway based on counting. If the median loss of an investment is $600, it means you had a 50% chance of losing more over $600 and a 50% chance of losing less than $600.

===Holding bond funds for the average "duration" of the fund===
A "duration" is a calculation based on bond math that gives a number of years, related to the bond's term but shorter. One interpretation of the duration is that it is the "point of indifference." It is too well known that when interest rates rise, bond values fall. What is less well known is that if a bond is held for its duration, at the end of that period of time it will have the same value regardless of what interest rates do, provided the yield curve moves in parallel. This does not apply to a bond ''fund'' because the bonds in a fund are all different "ages" at any given time, and because the yield curve doesn't move in parallel. So there are no guarantees, but, nevertheless, the duration tells us a holding period over which the fund is unlikely to lose money.

This leads us to expect, for example, that "short-term" bond funds--like the Vanguard Short-Term Bond Index Fund, with a duration of 2.7 years--will sometimes lose money over periods of 6 or 12 months, but rarely lose money over periods of 5 years. This expectation is borne out by history.

A bond fund may not lose money, in the sense of dollars, yet lose value to inflation.

===Holding stocks "for five years"===
Authorities advice against using stocks for money you will need in less than five years; '''Vanguard says ten.''' If you are considering using stocks for money you will need in five years, then you should familiarize yourself with the data for stocks held for five years. See [[Using mutual funds and ETFs for short-term savings (5 years)]]. 

Vanguard itself puts all of it stock funds in risk categories 4 and 5 and says "these funds may be appropriate for investors who have a long-term investment horizon '''(10 years or longer).'''" 

A few other authorities say:

"Do not invest any money in stocks you will need in less than five years.”—William J. Bernstein, ''The Four Pillars of Investing''.

“A rule of thumb in investing is that you should not invest money in stocks or stock funds that you will need in less than five years.”—Jack Brennan and Marta McCave, “Straight Talk on Investing.” 

“Owning stocks for the short term (less than five years) is foolish.”—''Kiplinger’s Personal Finance'', Nov, 2004.  

“Money you know you will need in the five to 10 years does not belong in stocks.”—Suze Orman, ''Suze Orman’s Action Plan''. 

Even Jim Cramer has said “If you need the money for something serious in the next four years, you cannot risk keeping it in stocks.”--Jim Cramer, ''Getting Back to Even''.

Investors are faced with a variety of choices on ''where'' to invest their money; for example, a [[taxable account]], a [[401(k)]], or an [[Traditional IRA |IRA]]. Knowing which accounts to invest in first will maximize return with a minimum of [[Tax-efficient fund placement|taxes]]. '''Prioritizing investments''' indicates the appropriate order in which investments go into these accounts.

Take care to ensure that any investment priority decision aligns with your [[Investment policy statement| Investment Policy Statement]].

This page describes the approximate order of accounts (and debts) that income should be contributed toward while working and accumulating assets. The corresponding order for withdrawing assets for spending in retirement is described in [[Retirement draw-down priority]].

==Funding priority==

Here is a general account funding priority that often works well for many people&lt;ref name="mmm"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://forum.mrmoneymustache.com/investor-alley/investment-order/msg1333153/#msg1333153| title=Investment order| publisher=Mr. Money Mustache Forum| date=December 8, 2016| accessdate=June 5, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.whitecoatinvestor.com/hrf_faq/what-order-should-i-fund-my-accounts-in/| title=What order should I fund my investing accounts in?| publisher=White Coat Investor| date=May 5, 2017| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230327073953/https://www.whitecoatinvestor.com/hrf_faq/what-order-should-i-fund-my-accounts-in/| archive-date=March 27, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://thefinancebuff.com/401k-roth-ira-then-back-at-401k.html| title=401(k), Roth IRA, then Back at 401(k)| publisher=The Finance Buff| date=October 22, 2006| accessdate=June 5, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; (not all points will apply to everyone).

|style="text-align:left;"| Contribute to a [[Health savings account|Health Savings Account]] (HSA) || 8-10%
|-
|colspan = "3" style="text-align:left;"| HSAs offer tax-free contributions, growth, and withdrawals when used for qualified medical expenses. You can view HSA contributions as being matched by the IRS.&lt;ref name="grabiner"/&gt; If you are in a 25% tax bracket, it costs you $750 to put $1000 in your HSA, and once it is there, it will not be taxed at all as long as you spend it for medical care, so this is as good as $1000 in a Roth IRA.&lt;ref name="grabiner"/&gt;{{#tag:ref|If you are in a 25% tax bracket, it costs you $750 to put $1000 in your HSA, and once it is there, it will not be taxed at all as along as you spend it for medical care.&lt;ref name="grabiner"/&gt; This means the deductible also gets discounted by your tax rate: this should be taken into account when comparing deductibles with non-HSA plans. Note that health plans with a [[Flexible spending arrangement|Flexible Spending Arrangement]] (FSA) also offer tax deductions; however, the FSA is a ''use-it-or-lose-it'' plan, with balances normally zeroed out at the end of every year.|group=note}}

After age 65, the HSA can also be used for non-medical expenses, with such withdrawals taxed at your regular tax rate. So if you are unlucky and are too healthy after 65, the HSA is still as good as a pre-tax retirement account.&lt;ref name="grabiner"&gt;{{Forum link| p=1962306| title=Prioritizing investments- HSA goes where? |author=grabiner| date=February 16, 2014}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike pre-tax retirement accounts, HSA contributions made through an employer are also [[payroll tax]]-deductible.

Use of an HSA requires participation in an IRS qualified [[High deductible health plan| high deductible health plan]] (HDHP) at work. Look at your particular health care needs to decide if you may be better off with a traditional health care plan or an HDHP plus HSA. If the latter, then using the HSA as an investment account can be advantageous.

|style="text-align:left;"| Contribute to available retirement accounts (for example, [[IRA]], [[401(k)]], [[403(b)]], [[457(b)]]) without a match || 8%
|-
|colspan = "3" style="text-align:left;"| Retirement accounts offer either an immediate tax deduction and tax-deferred growth (traditional) or life-long tax-free growth (Roth), plus [[asset protection]] and [[estate planning]] benefits. These accounts have annual contribution limits which are lost if not used.

You may have to choose among [[IRA#Comparison_to_employer_accounts|IRA vs. employer plan]] and/or [[traditional vs. Roth]] accounts. Consult those articles for more details.

Deductible IRA contributions are subject to income limits, but the income limit for contributing to a Roth IRA may be circumvented by the [[Backdoor Roth]] process.&lt;ref group="note"&gt; You should verify eligibility before making traditional IRA contributions: in particular, check the [https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/ira-deduction-limits tax-deduction limit]. For Roth IRAs, the [[backdoor Roth]] is a technique for making contributions when your income exceeds the [https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/plan-participant-employee/retirement-topics-ira-contribution-limits eligibility limit]. It is complicated in nature and may not be for everyone. Read the [[Backdoor Roth IRA#Cautions| Cautions]] section of the article before proceeding and ask in the forum if you are unsure.&lt;/ref&gt; Employer plans may also offer [[mega-backdoor Roth]] contributions, but these should be made only after normal contributions.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;This technique is only available through select employer plans; it is complicated in nature and may not be for everyone. Read the [[Mega-backdoor Roth#Determining if your plan supports the mega-backdoor Roth|Mega-backdoor Roth]] article to determine if your plan supports it, and ask in the forum if you are unsure.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''governmental''' [[457(b)]] behaves similarly to a 401(k) or 403(b), except that 457(b)s have no early (before age 59½) withdrawal penalties. If a governmental 457(b) has reasonable investments and low fees, it usually makes sense to contribute to one ''before'' other retirement accounts. '''Non-governmental''' 457(b)s and [[Non-qualified retirement plan|non-qualified retirement plans]] function very differently than most other retirement accounts; see [[#Less_common_accounts|below]] for details on whether and how these should be used.

'''Choosing between an employer retirement plan and an IRA'''

If the company plan offers good, low-cost funds, it may be preferable to contribute to the company plan ''before'' contributing to an IRA; see: [[IRA#Comparison to employer accounts|Comparison between IRAs and employer plans]].

Also, your [[Marginal tax rate|marginal tax rate]] may influence the decision: those subject to higher marginal tax rates should consider higher contributions to a tax-deferred plan (for example, traditional 401(k) or IRA) rather than a post-tax plan (for example, Roth 401(k) or IRA). See [[Traditional versus Roth]] for more guidance.

If you prefer traditional to Roth, and traditional contributions to the employer's plan are needed to reduce your [[Modified_Adjusted_Gross_Income#MAGI_for_traditional_IRA_purposes|Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI) for traditional IRA purposes]] enough to allow a full or partial IRA deduction (see [https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/ira-deduction-limits IRA Deduction Limits]), consider contributing to an employer plan before an IRA.

'''Employer plans with high cost funds'''

Many company plans contain [[401(k)#Expensive or mediocre choices|high-cost]] funds which make them unattractive. If you have such a plan, look for one or two index funds or a bond fund that can be used. If your company offers matching funds up to a certain contribution level, it is '''always''' wise to use the company plan. If there is no match, the power of tax-deferred compounding and automatic contributions still favors using the plan with limited contributions.

Also, if you leave your current employer you will most likely be able to rollover the assets in your poor-quality company plan to either a better company plan, or to an IRA.

|-
|colspan = "3" style="text-align:left;"| Typically these include student loans, car loans, personal loans, and Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs).

At that point, your 529 plan contributions would come before taxable investing. 529 plans offer tax-free growth (like a [[Roth IRA]]) when used for qualified education expenses, and may offer state tax benefits for contribution.

==Less common accounts==

===Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP)===

If your employer offers an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP), it may be very beneficial to use, though a lower priority than getting a retirement match. A typical ESPP allows you to buy shares of your employer's publicly-traded stock at a significant discount from the market price. After a contribution and holding period (usually six months), you can withdraw the shares and sell them on the open market for a profit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fidelity.com/go/stock-plan-services/employee-stock-purchase-plans|title=Invest in your work and your future with an ESPP|publisher=Fidelity|accessdate=Aug 31, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the plan allows shares to be sold immediately, there is little to no market risk for the stock and the plan is like free money, albeit with an interruption in cash flow and some extra paperwork. Once you have gone through one contribution period, proceeds from the plan will offset contributions, and your cash flow will be neutral with an excellent rate of return. Details vary, so check with your company's benefits department.

However, if the plan requires shares to be held for a significant time after the contribution period, that exposes you to significant concentrated market risk and also lowers the rate of return, and the benefit of the plan is more questionable. In any case, voluntarily holding onto company stock for longer than necessary to get the plan benefits is usually not advised, due to the concentrated risk of simultaneous crash of the stock price and loss of your job. 

===Non-governmental 457(b) plan===
{{Main|457(b)}}

Despite the similarity in name, non-governmental 457(b)s are very different from governmental 457(b)s and other retirement accounts; they are more of a deferred compensation plan. Compared to other retirement plans, non-governmental 457(b)s have several major drawbacks: 

* The balance cannot be rolled into an [[IRA]] upon separation from the employer
* The distribution options may be poor, possibly forcing you to withdraw all your assets in the year you separate from the employer and concentrating all that taxable income in one year
* Assets in the plan are legally property of the employer until distributed to you, raising [[asset protection]] concerns

Read the plan documents carefully, particularly the distribution options, and consider your employer's financial health before deciding to invest in a non-governmental 457(b). It usually makes sense to use a non-governmental 457(b) only after other retirement accounts, if at all. If a non-governmental 457(b) makes sense to use, the lack of early withdrawal penalties can be useful in certain situations, such as early retirement.

===Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation (NQDC) plan===
{{Main|Non-qualified retirement plan}}

Some companies allow some employees (often limited to those above some rank) to defer compensation until after leaving that company. As noted in the brief wiki section, Deferred compensation plan (non-qualified), and various forum topics such as Deferred compensation worth it? (search for "deferred compensation" to find others), details on these plans vary widely.

An NQDC plan may be particularly valuable to a highly paid employee because it allows you to defer tax at high marginal tax rates on amounts much greater than 401(k) and similar plans do. The plan will not, however, be valuable at all if the company goes bankrupt, or may be less valuable than expected if you continue to work elsewhere and must add NQDC distributions to your employed earnings.

      <text bytes="4933" sha1="9uj5o8i9zr9tjbb4nrezh48ztpnlh0m" xml:space="preserve">'''Lump-sum investing''' looks at your options when you receive a [[Managing a windfall|windfall]], such as an inheritance, bonus payment, or sale of a small business. You need to decide whether to invest the cash immediately as a lump sum or adopt a strategy known as [[dollar cost averaging]] (DCA), where you make a series of investments over time. DCA aims to reduce the risk of investing the entire lump sum immediately before a market downturn.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=April 21, 2023 |title=Lump-sum investing versus cost averaging: Which is better? |url=https://investor.vanguard.com/investor-resources-education/news/lump-sum-investing-versus-cost-averaging-which-is-better |access-date=2025-01-16 |website=Vanguard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The short answer is that lump-sum investing is the better choice about two-thirds of the time. DCA can provide certain behavioral advantages that can minimize downside risk and reduce feelings of [[Regret aversion|regret]].  

==Why choose to lump-sum invest==
The main reason to invest all of it as a lump sum is you gain exposure to the markets as soon as possible and historical market trends indicate that [[Stock|stocks]] and [[Bond|bonds]] returns exceed returns on cash investments.

Lump-sum investing will always carry a higher expected return, because it immediately moves your funds from asset classes with lower expected returns to ones with higher expected returns. Note that higher ''expected'' returns do not guarantee that your ''actual'' returns will be higher. 

A Vanguard study concluded that lump-sum investing has historically produced higher returns two thirds of the time when the DCA plan was implemented over 12 months. Lump sum was also more favorable when the analysis used risk-adjusted returns. DCA plans with longer timelines have worse results.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Shtekhman A, Tasopoulos C, Wimmer B (2012) [https://web.archive.org/web/20190404110643/https://personal.vanguard.com/pdf/s315.pdf Dollar-cost averaging just means taking risk later], Vanguard Research Paper, viewed August 31, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

A related Vanguard publication notes that if a DCA plan was implemented over 36 months, lump-sum investing produced higher returns approximately 92% of the time. In addition, over a 12-month period, the maximum downside potential of DCA was higher than the maximum upside potential.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Berkowitz|first=Daniel B.|date=2016|title=Invest now or temporarily hold your cash?|url=https://www.optimizedportfolio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/vanguard-invest-now-or-temporarily-hold-your-cash.pdf|publisher=Vanguard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Why not lump-sum invest==
The main reason to choose not to lump-sum invest is if the investor is primarily concerned with minimizing downside risk and potential feelings of regret (resulting from lump-sum investing immediately before a market downturn), then DCA may be of use.

==Study results==
A variety of studies have covered the lump sum versus cost averaging question and generally they come to the following conclusions.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Finlay|first=Megan|last2=Zorn|first2=Josef|date=February 2023|title=Cost averaging: Invest now or temporarily hold your cash?|url=https://corporate.vanguard.com/content/dam/corp/research/pdf/cost_averaging_invest_now_or_temporarily_hold_your_cash.pdf|website=Vanguard research}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Lauricella|first=Tom|date=November 26, 2019|title=Dollar-cost averaging vs. lump-sum investing|url=https://www.morningstar.ca/ca/news/197440/dollar-cost-averaging-vs-lump-sum-investing.aspx|access-date=2025-01-16|website=Morningstar Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Lump-sum investment strategies beat common cost averaging investment strategies two-thirds of the time, according to historical and simulated  market data.
*Despite the expectation of lower returns, cost averaging might be considered for investors with very high aversion to both risk and [[Loss aversion|losses]] who might be tempted to hold a lump sum entirely in cash.
