According to [[Bogleheads' Guide To Investing | The Bogleheads' Guide to Investing]], the financially sound use of credit and debit cards takes advantage of the convenience such cards can provide, as long as you ''always'' pay the balance due each month, avoiding interest charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author1=Taylor Larimore| author1-link=Taylor Larimore| author2=Michael LeBoeuf| author2-link=Michael LeBoeuf| author3=Mel Lindauer| author3-link=Mel Lindauer| title=The Bogleheads' Guide to Investing| title-link=Bogleheads' Guide To Investing| isbn=978-1-118-92128-9| pp=10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some '''credit cards''' provide programs that rebate a percentage of purchases back to the cardholder.
__TOC__

== Types of credit cards ==
Credit cards can be obtained by using secured or unsecured debt agreements. Secured credit cards are designed for individuals with bad or no credit history, and require the individual to pre-pay for purchases made on the card, while also charging a monthly or annual fee to use the card. Secured credit cards typically do not come with rewards of any type. Unsecured credit cards are designed for individuals with low debt-to-income ratios and a positive credit history. Unsecured credit cards can have a variety of rewards associated with them.

Credit card rewards fall into three broad categorizations, cards that earn "miles", cards that earn "points", and cards that earn cash back. 
{{Notice|
These tables are intended as examples to show the variations among card issuers. &lt;u&gt;They are ''not'' recommendations.&lt;/u&gt; Read &lt;u&gt;all&lt;/u&gt; of the ''Terms and Conditions'' in the card issuer's agreement, as exceptions can be subtle and potentially influence a decision.
}}
== Cash back credit cards ==
These cards return high rates of cash back to their holders, whether in all purchase categories ("Everything" in the table below) or in specific categories. Many also offer one-time sign-up bonuses, such as $100 cash back when the user spends $1,000 in the first three months as a cardholder. [http://www.nerdwallet.com NerdWallet] has a frequently updated database of credit cards, and offers tools to estimate cash back rewards based on individual spending patterns.

===Rotating cash back categories===
Several card issuers offer cash back cards whose categories rotate periodically. For example, [http://www.discovercard.com/more/ Discover More] offers 5% cash back on categories which vary as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[http://discovercard.com/credit-cards/ Discover cards]. Note that there are dollar restrictions for each time period, for example a $200 limit for groceries purchased in June.&lt;/ref&gt; 
*''January through March'': Travel and restaurants
*''April through June'': Home and fashion
*''June'': Grocery and drug stores
*''July through September:'' Gas, hotels, movies and theme parks
*''October through December:'' Restaurants and fashion

== Point earning credit cards ==
Some credit cards offer points earned for each dollar spent on the card. Point cards are somewhat easier to compare to cash back cards due to the cash back exchange rate, which is typically $0.01/point. Many point cards offer access to unique opportunities, such as discounted partner products or exclusive events. These vary significantly by issuer so the prospective card holder must judge how valuable these are.

== Mile earning credit cards ==
Some credit cards offer you miles for each dollar spent on the card. Miles vary dramatically in worth as most are redeemable only through select airlines, issuer-sponsored websites, or various mile-exchange programs for charities. Comparisons of mileage cards are exceptionally difficult as airfare prices vary dramatically and mile redemption rates are subject to blackout dates or airline exchange rate changes. The overall worth of any mileage credit card should be assessed by the individual based on their travel behavior, desired destinations, and preferred airline conglomerate. The following considerations should be prior to committing to a mileage credit card:
*Airline-specific cards have significant benefits for frequent travelers of that airline, but limit any benefit outside of their conglomerate
*Compare the purchase price of the ticket you want to the miles expended over time
*Check the desired airline's preferences to determine how likely award fliers are to be booted in the event of an overbooked flight
*Look at locations your target airline/conglomerate of choice services

== Multiple credit cards ==
Many credit card users obtain cards from several issuers, then optimize their spending patterns to maximize the cash reward. For example, you might use the American Express Blue Cash Preferred card for all grocery purchases, and the Capital One Venture card for all other purchases. While using multiple credit cards is tempting, there are a number of considerations which may dissuade card holders from this approach:
*The effort needed to track multiple cards is significant.&lt;ref name="BH"&gt;{{forum link| t=71687| title=Rotating 5% back categories for Credit Cards}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Many cash back cards require a minimum amount of cash back to be earned before it can be redeemed. Using several cards, you will accumulate cash back more slowly on each card, and therefore it may take longer to actually earn a redeemable amount of cash back on any one card.
*It's easy to forget a payment or lose a card. The fees, interest charges, and credit score impact of such an oversight can quickly ruin any savings you might have earned.&lt;ref name="Investo"&gt;[http://www.investopedia.com/financial-edge/0711/How-Many-Credit-Cards-Should-You-Have.aspx How Many Credit Cards Should You Have?], from [http://www.investopedia.com/ Investopedia]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Opening multiple credit card accounts can help your credit score, but this technique may backfire and lower your score as well.&lt;ref name="Investo"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
*Card issuers often coordinate their cash back categories (similar categories during the same time period), which results in minimal benefit to using multiple rotating-category cards.&lt;ref name="BH"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mybanktracker.com/bank-news/2011/03/08/credit-card-cash-rotating-categories-april-june-2011/ Credit Card 5% Cash Back Rotating Categories: April to June 2011]{{broken link}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Cash back categories have spending limits. Spreading purchases over several cards to avoid these limits is complex to track.

== Just one credit card ==
Using just one credit card may not get you as many rewards, but is easier to do overall--you don't have to figure out which card to use where, nor deal with any of the other multi-card hassles (see [[#Multiple credit cards|Multiple credit cards]] above). If you do this, you should try to find a card with either no cap on the rewards you can earn, or a cap high enough that you won't hit it with your spending pattern.

==Credit report==
:''[https://www.annualcreditreport.com/cra/index.jsp AnnualCreditReport.com] (enable browser cookies)''

The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) requires each of the nationwide consumer reporting companies — Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion — to provide you with a free copy of your credit report, at your request, weekly.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;It used to be that consumers were allowed one free report from each of the bureaus annually, but in October 2023 the Federal Trade Commission announced the bureaus had permanently extended a program that lets you check your credit report once a week for free: [https://consumer.ftc.gov/consumer-alerts/2023/10/you-now-have-permanent-access-free-weekly-credit-reports FTC announcement]&lt;/ref&gt;

AnnualCreditReport.com is a centralized service for consumers to request free annual credit reports. It was created by the three nationwide consumer credit reporting companies - Equifax, Experian and TransUnion - and is the only service authorized for this purpose.

A credit report includes information on where you live, how you pay your bills, and whether you've been sued, arrested, or filed for bankruptcy. Nationwide consumer reporting companies sell the information in your report to creditors, insurers, employers, and other businesses that use it to evaluate your applications for credit, insurance, employment, or renting a home.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/credit/rights.shtm Your Rights: Credit Reporting], from the [http://www.ftc.gov/ Federal Trade Commission]&lt;/ref&gt;

Your '''''credit score''''' is an evaluation of the information in your credit report which estimates the probability that you will become delinquent on a new credit application.  A lender will decide whether to offer you a loan based on credit score, as well as other information such as your income, type of loan, and collateral.

==Criteria for scoring==
The score is based on items in your credit report which predict future delinquencies; the exact criteria and weights vary by provider.  The following weights are used in the FICO&lt;ref&gt;FICO is a registered trademark of the Fair Isaac Corporation.&lt;/ref&gt; score, one of the most commonly used scoring models.&lt;ref name="FICO brochure"&gt;[http://www.myfico.com/Downloads/Files/myFICO_UYFS_Booklet.pdf Understanding Your FICO&lt;sup&gt;&amp;reg;&lt;/sup&gt; Score]&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Payment history''' (number of accounts with on-time payments; number and recency of late payments, collections, public record items such as judgments): 35%
*'''Amounts owed''' (including the ratio of the amount owed to the limits on credit cards, or to the original balance for an installment loan): 30%
*'''Length of credit history''' (age of oldest, newest, and average accounts): 15%
*'''New credit''' (new accounts and inquiries): 10% 
*'''Types of credit in use''' (revolving or installment, number of each): 10%

A newer model, the VantageScore&lt;ref&gt;VantageScore is a registered trademark of VantageScore Solutions, LLC; the VantageScore itself was developed by the credit bureaus.&lt;/ref&gt;, has similar weights.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.vantagescore.com/images/resources/VSS_0572_FactSheet_091718.pdf VantageScore 4.0 fact sheet, September 17, 2018]&lt;/ref&gt;.   Older versions gave more weight to recent behavior and current balances.  VantageScore 3.0 listed the weights as bars&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vantagescore.com/pdf/VantageScore_3_0_infographic_3_11_13.pdf VantageScore 3.0 information sheet]&lt;/ref&gt;, and version 2.0 listed the weights as percentages.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.transunion.com/docs/rev/business/financialservices/vantageScore_2.0_White_Paper_FINAL.PDF VantageScore 2.0 white paper]&lt;/ref&gt;  

*'''Payment history''': 41%, was 6 bars in 3.0, 28% in 2.0 (35% of FICO)
*'''Percent of credit limit used''': 20%, was 4 bars in 3.0, 23% in 2.0 (including the two criteria below, 30% of FICO)
*'''Total of balances''': 6%, was 3 bars in 3.0, 9% in 2.0 (not a separate factor with FICO)
*'''Available credit''': 2%, was 1 bar in 3.0, 1% in 2.0 (not directly considered by FICO)
*'''Age and type of credit''': 20%, was 4 bars in 3.0, 9% in 2.0 (25% of FICO)
*'''Recent credit''': 11%, was 2 bars in 3.0, 30% in 2.0 (10% of FICO)

These weights are averages; the actual relevance of each factor depends on the rest of your report.  In addition, lenders use variations of the scores depending on the type of credit, as the factors which predict delinquency for credit cards, installment loans, and mortgages may be slightly different.

The score is based on the information in your report at the time it was last reported by the creditor.  Therefore, if you had a balance on a credit card and paid it in full by the due date, the balance owed on the statement date will be reported even though the current balance may be zero.  This also explains why you may have a different score at the different credit bureaus; not all creditors report to all of the bureaus, and even when they do, the last report date may be different.

===Maintaining and improving your score===
The criteria for scoring indicate how to maintain a good score.  Most important, of course, is to make payments on time; setting up a reminder, or an automatic payment from your checking account, ensures that payments will be made.  If you have delinquencies, there is nothing you can do to improve this part of your report except for continuing to make payments on time; older delinquencies are less important, and delinquencies more than seven years old are no longer reported.

Similarly, you need to limit the ratio of the balance owed to the credit limit on your credit cards.  If you are about to apply for credit, ensure that you do not have a large balance on any card in the previous month; paying off the balance in full will not help if the new balance has not yet been reported.  If you are carrying a large balance, paying it down is both an excellent investment and good for your credit score in case you need to apply for credit later.

The length of your credit history includes both open and closed accounts.  Opening new accounts does decrease your score slightly, both because it reduces the average age of accounts and because new accounts themselves represent an increased risk.  The new-account effect is temporary; once the new accounts are no longer new, the effect of the new accounts will go away, while other effects on your credit score such as more open accounts or a higher credit limit will remain.  Therefore, you should avoid opening new accounts if your score will be important soon.

However, closing an old account will not reduce your score directly unless it affects some other factor such as the ratio of balances to credit limits or the types of credit in use.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ficoforums.myfico.com/t5/Credit-Cards/Closing-Credit-Cards/m-p/347190/message-uid/347190#U347190 Closing Credit Cards]&lt;/ref&gt;  And this makes sense; if you paid a credit card on time six years ago, that is just as relevant to your credit whether that particular card is currently open or closed.  (An account with no delinquencies which has not been active for ten years will disappear from your report; therefore, it may slightly decrease your score ten years after you close it, as the payment record and age of accounts will no longer count it.)

Inquiries are counted for only twelve months, and scoring models recognize when multiple inquiries are not the result of multiple attempts to open accounts.  Multiple auto, student, or home loan inquiries within a short time are counted as only one inquiry because you are probably shopping for rates rather than buying multiple cars, college funds, or homes.&lt;ref name="FICO brochure"/&gt;  The inquiries are another reason to avoid opening other new accounts if your score will be important soon.

Inquiries which are not credit-related should be listed on your credit report as "Inquiries reported only to you"; they will not affect your score because potential creditors do not see them.  This includes requests for your own file, account reviews by existing creditors, promotional inquiries, and requests for non-credit purposes such as insurance and employment.

==Checking your score==
When you check your credit report (for example, the free annual report from [http://www.annualcreditreport.com AnnualCreditReport.com]), or a paid report directly from the bureau, you will usually be given the option to purchase a credit score at the same time.

There are also commercial services which will give you a credit score.  Most such services advertise a "free" score or report, but the score is only free with enrollment in a credit monitoring service.  Two commercial services which are actually free (supported by advertising or by internal promotions):
* [http://www.creditkarma.com Credit Karma] gives VantageScores (version 3.0) from both Trans Union and Equifax, and full credit reports from both bureaus.
* [http://www.creditsesame.com Credit Sesame] gives Experian's National Equivalency Score from your Experian report.

A lender may give you your score as part of the loan process, but it is usually too late for you to do anything with the score unless there is an error on the credit report.

Checking your own credit report and score does not count as an inquiry for scoring purposes, and is not disclosed to lenders.

===Credit reporting companies===
{{Credit reporting companies}}

==What should appear in a score report==
A score report should give your numerical score, and an indication of how that score compares to other credit reports.  The percentile is what is important; as different scoring systems, even with the same range, may have a different score distribution.

It should also give the primary reasons that the score is not higher.  Note that these reasons are written as reasons for denial of credit; "Ratio of amount owed on revolving accounts to credit limits is too high" could mean that you were denied credit because you have maxed out your credit cards, or it could mean that you have excellent credit and one reason it is not perfect is that you owe 15% of the credit limit on your cards and it would be better if you owed 5%.

Credit Karma does not give standard score explanations; its "Credit Factors" list a single number for the main scoring factors, but not the details of that number.  If you want to see how to improve your credit score, you need to get a score with the full explanations.  For example, Credit Karma gives a color rating for the number of accounts on your report, not distinguishing open and closed accounts, or accounts of different types.

==Importance==
A credit score is only used when you apply for credit (and, in some states, for insurance).  Therefore, your score today is irrelevant if you are not planning to apply for any credit until next year; it doesn't hurt to charge the full limit on a credit card if the balance is paid in full before you need the credit report for any purpose, and it will not hurt your score significantly if you open a new credit card a year before you need a good score (as long as you pay on time and keep the balance low).  You should check your report regularly (to check for errors), but need not check your score.

In addition, lenders do not care about differences between very high scores, as they all represent a very low risk.  Therefore, if it is clear from your credit report that your credit is excellent (no late payments, several accounts that have been open for years, no card anywhere near the limit, at most one new account), you do not need your score.  And if you have an excellent score, you can afford to do things which will benefit you but lower the score, such as opening a new credit card with better benefits, closing a card you no longer want, or charging 25% of the limit on a card.

==Insurance scores==
Insurers have found that credit behavior also predicts the probability that customers will file claims and the amount of claims.  In many states, insurers will use a score based on your credit file as part of the determinantion of insurance rates; the use is restricted by state law in some states.

===Scoring models===
FICO gives the following breakdown for its credit-based insurance score.  The criteria are similar to FICO's standard criteria, with slightly more emphasis on payment history and less on types of credit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://insurancescores.fico.com/Pages/InScore.html What's in your score (FICO)]&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Previous credit performance''': 40%
*'''Current level of indebtedness''': 30%
*'''Length of credit history''': 15%
*'''New credit/pursuit of new credit''': 10%
*'''Types of credit used''': 5%

However, there is much more variation among models.  A model which Allstate filed with the NC Department of Insurance&lt;ref&gt;[http://infoportal.ncdoi.net/getfile.jsp?sfp=/PC/PC095000/PC095470A815823.PDF Allstate Insurance Scoring Model 7]&lt;/ref&gt; gives a much higher weight to inquiries; in this model, a single credit-card inquiry for a customer costs 5-10 times as much as a recently opened account.  Credit Karma does not provide criteria for its insurance scores, but reports from the score it provides also show that it is very sensitive to inquiries, as a poster reported a huge jump in his score when his one inquiry became 18 months old.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=97429 Forum post: Insurance score quirks may encourage shopping]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Value of high scores===
In contrast to credit scores, very high scores are important for insurance scoring.  Allstate's insurance scoring model reports that the customers with the top 10% of insurance scores had 81% of the average loss ratio for auto and 62% for homeowner's insurance, while the second 10% had 85% of the average loss ratio for auto and 75% for homeowner's insurance.  Thus it is likely that an insurer will give a larger discount for excellent scores than for merely good scores.

===Taking advantage of your insurance score===
Many insurers will only use credit scoring for new policies.  Therefore, if your insurance score has improved since you obtained a policy, you may get a significantly lower rate if you ask your insurer to recheck your score; it will not be done automatically.

Since insurance scores may be very sensitive to inquiries, and most inquiries are made with only one credit bureau, shopping for insurance with companies which use different bureaus (or different scoring models with the same bureau) may give you different scores and rates.  You need not be concerned about inquiries affecting your credit score, as insurance inquiries are not reported to anyone other than you.

A '''credit freeze''', also known as a security freeze,  lets you restrict access to your credit report, which in turn makes it more difficult for identity thieves to open new accounts in your name. That’s because most creditors need to see your credit report before they approve a new account. If they can’t see your file, they may not extend the credit.&lt;ref name = "FTC"&gt;[https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0497-credit-freeze-faqs Credit Freeze FAQs], from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), September 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

If you’re concerned about identity theft, those reported mega-data breaches, or someone gaining access to your credit report without your permission, you might consider placing a credit freeze on your report.&lt;ref name = "FTC" /&gt;

==A credit freeze does not==
A credit freeze does not completely block access to your credit report, as certain entities will continue to have access.&lt;ref name = "FTC" /&gt;

* your report can be released to your existing creditors or to debt collectors acting on their behalf.
* government agencies may have access in response to a court or administrative order, a subpoena, or a search warrant.

A credit freeze does nothing to prevent you from using existing lines of credit you may have (e.g. credit cards, loans, etc).&lt;ref name = "Krebs"&gt;[https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/09/the-equifax-breach-what-you-should-know/ The Equifax Breach: What You Should Know], from Brian Krebs, viewed September 16, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

A credit freeze also does not:&lt;ref name = "FTC" /&gt;

* affect your [[credit score]].
* prevent you from getting your [[Credit cards#Credit report|free annual credit report]].
* keep you from opening a new account, applying for a job, renting an apartment, or buying insurance. But if you’re doing any of these, you’ll need to lift the freeze temporarily, either for a specific time or for a specific party, say, a potential landlord or employer. The cost and lead times to lift a freeze vary, so it’s best to check with the credit reporting company in advance.
* prevent a thief from making charges to your existing accounts. You still need to monitor all bank, credit card and insurance statements for fraudulent transactions.
* stop prescreened credit offers.

==Placing a freeze on your credit report==
You can place a freeze on your credit report by contacting ''each'' of the nationwide credit reporting companies listed [[#Credit reporting agencies | below]]. Since the freeze is by Social Security number, you must make a separate request for ''each'' person, such as you and a spouse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Forum post|p=3535228||title=Re: Wiki article - Credit freeze}}, by forum member BigJohn.&lt;/ref&gt;

You'll need to supply your name, address, date of birth, Social Security number and other personal information.

After receiving your freeze request, each credit reporting company will send you a confirmation letter containing a unique PIN (personal identification number) or password. Keep the PIN (personal identification number) or password in a safe place. You will need it if you choose to lift the freeze.&lt;ref name = "FTC" /&gt;

Exception: If you freeze your account online, the "big three" reporting companies will give you the PIN right away. Nothing will be mailed to you.&lt;ref name="learning_head"&gt;{{Forum post|p=3548324 |title = Re: Wiki article - Credit freeze}}, by forum member learning_head.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fees charged by state no longer apply===

==Other companies==
In addition to credit reporting companies, you can also freeze reporting from the following agencies:&lt;ref name="bh$"&gt;{{Forum post |p=4372841 |title=Re: Wiki article - Credit freeze|author=Saving$|date=Feb 09, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

You may also request a free Employment Data Report.

The following companies don't allow you to freeze reporting, but will allow you to obtain a free copy of your report.&lt;ref name="bh$" /&gt;

* Insurance underwriting
**[https://www.mib.com/request_your_record.html MIB Group], a member-owned corporation.

TeleCheck helps merchant locations decide whether to accept check transactions by analyzing information about check transactions that previously have been sent through its system. TeleCheck maintains a live database comprised of check and bank account debt records.

==Before you freeze your credit==
Before freezing your credit, you should create an online account with the [https://www.ssa.gov/ Social Security Administration]. Your identity is verified by Equifax. A credit freeze will cause the identity check to fail.&lt;ref&gt;[https://faq.ssa.gov/link/portal/34011/34019/Article/3872/Will-Social-Security-s-Identity-Services-Provider-change-my-credit-score-or-credit-report Will Social Security's Identity Services Provider change my credit score or credit report?], from the Social Security Administration. Equifax is named here: [https://www.ssa.gov/hlp/mySSA/df-idverification.html Definition: Identity Services Provider].&lt;/ref&gt;

If you are interested in monitoring your [[Credit score#Checking your score|credit score]] with [https://www.creditkarma.com/ Credit Karma] (or some other credit monitoring service), you should do it before freezing your credit, or you will need to lift the freeze in order to register your account. You can (re)freeze your credit after the monitoring account is created.&lt;ref&gt;[https://help.creditkarma.com/hc/en-us/articles/202041774-I-have-a-security-freeze-on-my-credit-reports-Can-I-still-use-Credit-Karma- I have a security freeze on my credit reports. Can I still use Credit Karma?], from Credit Karma, viewed September 14, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lifting a freeze on your credit report==
In a few states, credit freezes expire after seven years. In the vast majority of states, a freeze remains in place until you ask the credit reporting company to temporarily lift it or remove it altogether. A credit reporting company must lift a freeze no later than three business days after getting your request. There is no cost to lift a freeze.

When temporarily ''lifting'' a freeze online, it gets done very fast; within 15 minutes or so, or maybe even instantly. This may apply to all agencies, but can be confirmed for ChexSystems and Equifax. (The 3 day delay may apply to when you make the request by mail.)&lt;ref name = &lt;ref name="learning_head" /&gt;

If you opt for a temporary lift because you are applying for credit or a job, and you can find out which credit reporting company the business will contact for your file, you can save some money by lifting the freeze only at that particular company.&lt;ref name = "FTC" /&gt;

==Fraud alert==
A fraud alert is not the same as a credit freeze.

A fraud alert allows creditors to get a copy of your credit report as long as they take steps to verify your identity. For example, if you provide a telephone number, the business must call you to verify whether you are the person making the credit request.&lt;ref name = "FTC" /&gt; In other words, additional verification of identity happens ''after'' they get the report, not before.&lt;ref name = &lt;ref name="learning_head" /&gt;

Fraud alerts are less effective than a credit freeze, as responsibility for verifying your identity rests with the company requesting the report; not the credit reporting agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.consumerreports.org/consumer-protection/security-freeze-vs-fraud-alert-deciding-the-best-option/|title=Security Freeze vs. Fraud Alert: Deciding the Best Option|last=Blyskal |first=Jeff |date=September 13, 2017  |publisher=Consumer Reports|accessdate=September 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fraud alerts may not prevent the misuse of your ''existing'' accounts. You still need to monitor all bank, credit card and insurance statements for fraudulent transactions.&lt;ref name = "FTC" /&gt;

Three types of fraud alerts are available:&lt;ref name = "FTC" /&gt;

*'''Initial Fraud Alert.''' If you're concerned about identity theft, but haven't yet become a victim, this fraud alert will protect your credit from unverified access for at least 90 days. You may want to place a fraud alert on your file if your wallet, Social Security card, or other personal, financial or account information are lost or stolen.
*'''Extended Fraud Alert.''' For victims of identity theft, an extended fraud alert will protect your credit for seven years.
*'''Active Duty Military Alert.''' For those in the military who want to protect their credit while deployed, this fraud alert lasts for one year.

===Placing a fraud alert===
You can place an initial fraud alert on your credit report online or by calling any one of the three big credit reporting agencies. The agency then must, by law, notify the other two agencies on its own. You can place the initial fraud alert whether you were a victim of identity theft or if you are just concerned about it.&lt;ref name = &lt;ref name="learning_head" /&gt;

It is free to place the initial alert and it stays on your report for at least 90 days. You can renew it for free after 90 days any number of times. Be sure the credit reporting companies have your current contact information so they can get in touch with you.&lt;ref name = &lt;ref name="learning_head" /&gt;

==Credit Monitoring==
Credit monitoring tracks activity on your credit reports at one, two, or all three of the major credit reporting agencies. Many companies refer to their services as identity theft protection services. What these companies offer are monitoring and recovery services. Monitoring services watch for signs that an identity thief may be using your personal information. Recovery services help you deal with the effects of identity theft after it happens.&lt;ref name="Protection"&gt;[https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0235-identity-theft-protection-services Identity Theft Protection Services], from the Federal Trade Commission, viewed September 16, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous credit cards and personal finance websites offer free credit scores, and basic monitoring services. If you’ve been a victim of a data breach, you’ve probably been offered a year of free identity-theft monitoring.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/finance/credit-monitoring-identity-theft-monitoring/ Should You Buy Credit and Identity Theft Monitoring], from NerdWallet, April 1, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most you can hope for is that credit monitoring services will alert you soon after an ID thief ''makes use of'' your stolen identity. That is, hopefully sooner then you might have discovered on your own by reading your free annual credit report.&lt;ref name = &lt;ref name="learning_head" /&gt;

===Free credit monitoring===
Some services only monitor your credit report at one of the credit reporting agencies. So, for example, if your service only monitors TransUnion, you won’t be alerted to items that appear on your Equifax or Experian reports.&lt;ref name="Protection" /&gt;

If the credit monitoring service is free, monitoring is likely to ''only'' cover the agency you signed up with. The agency may offer monitoring of other credit reporting agencies for a fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{Forum post|p=3545826 |title=Wiki article - Credit freeze}}, by forum member LadyGeek.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notes==
&lt;references group="note" /&gt;
Some states let parents create a credit file for their child and then freeze it, while many states have no laws on the matter. Here’s a [https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/01/the-lowdown-on-freezing-your-kids-credit/ short primer] on the current situation, with the availability of credit freezes for minors by state and by credit bureau. &lt;ref&gt;[https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/01/the-lowdown-on-freezing-your-kids-credit/ The Lowdown on Freezing Your Kid’s Credit], from Brian Krebs, January 15, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;
Equifax, Experian, and Transunion allow you to freeze a minor's credit report, but you need to mail documentation, such as birth certificate, driver's license, Social Security card, utility bill.

Your '''Expected Family Contribution''' ('''EFC''') is an amount determined by your family's and student's income and assets which is used to determine your eligibility for need-based college aid. It is computed from the [http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/ Free Application for Federal Student Aid] according to formulas on the [https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/resources#efc Expected Family Contribution worksheet]. Some colleges will meet your full need and limit the cost to the EFC, but even if a college does not meet the full need, the amount of need-based aid you receive is likely to depend on the EFC.

__TOC__

==Basic formula==
For each academic year, the income is calculated from tax forms for two years ago; for example, 2015 tax forms are used for the 2017-2018 EFC.   (This allows the application to be filed before the tax form; if the prior year's tax form was required, applicants would have to wait until filing their taxes before applying for aid for the next fall.)  Assets are reported as of the day the form is filed.

For a dependent student, the EFC comes from both the parents and the students:
* '''Parental adjusted available income''': The contribution formula is progressive, with a 22% rate on the lowest levels of available income, up to 47% on higher levels. The income is determined by:
** '''Available income''': after-tax income, including non-taxable income, reduced by a basic income allowance depending on family size.
** '''Discretionary net worth''': Net worth reduced by a savings allowance depending on the parents' age. Net worth does not include a home, retirement account, small family business, or family farm. 12% of discretionary net worth is added to available income, which causes 5.64% of discretionary net worth to be part of the expected contribution at the 47% rate.
** Divide by the number of children in college to determine each child's EFC.
* '''Student income''': after-tax income, including non-taxable income, reduced by a basic income allowance. 50% of student income above the basic allowance is included in the student's EFC.
* '''Student assets''': Net worth not including the value of a home, retirement account, small family business, or family farm. 20% of all student assets are included in the student's EFC.

For an independent student, the EFC comes from only the student's income and assets, but still at the same 50% rate on income (with a larger allowance) and 20% on assets (with an allowance) unless the student has non-spouse dependents.

==Definition of income==
Income includes all discretionary income. It thus includes taxable income as reported on a tax form, but it also includes non-taxable income such as child support and tax-exempt interest. Tax-free withdrawals from an [[IRA]] are also considered income; withdrawals from a [[529]] plan are not considered income because the 529 plan was already considered an asset. Voluntary retirement contributions (to an IRA, [[401(k)]], or other retirement plan) are considered discretionary and are thus included in income.

Money received or bills paid by a third party are also considered income. Scholarships are not income, but tuition paid by someone other than the student or parent is a bill paid by a third party and is thus income to the student.

Income is reduced by the actual amount of federal income and Social Security tax, and by a fixed percentage of gross income to estimate state and local taxes. The percentage depends on the state.

==Definition of net worth==
Net worth is calculated separately for bank accounts, investments, and businesses and farms; a negative value in any one category is treated as zero and cannot offset a positive value elswehere. Investments include real estate (but not the home that you live in), and non-retirement investment accounts, but do not include retirement accounts such as IRAs or 401(k)s. College savings investments such as 529 plans and [[Coverdell Education Savings Account]]s (regardless of the beneficiary) are considered investments; however, they are considered parental assets if owned by the student. Small family businesses and family farms are not counted in net worth; small businesses and farms which are counted in net worth are counted at a reduced value.

==Reducing EFC==
The formula for the EFC makes it possible to manage investments in order to prevent them from being counted, or to move income or assets from one category to another.

===Moving income to a non-counted year===
The EFC is determined based on income in the calendar year two years before the academic year for which it is computed. Any income received in previous years is not counted (although it will become an asset if not spent), and income received in the calendar year before the student starts their last year of college (2016 for a student graduating in 2018) is not counted for any year that the student is in college. (If you have two children in college in consecutive years, you cannot use the "last year" for one child as it will increase the EFC for the other child in the next year.)

Therefore, if the college spending will produce income, it is best to delay this income until the year it will not be counted; use it for the student's last two years, or January or later of the previous year. For example, if grandparents or other relatives than the parents own a 529 plan with the student as beneficiary, the plan should be used for January of the sophomore year or later; otherwise, the withdrawal will be income to the student and will significantly reduce aid in the next year. Similarly, if some of the college funds will come from an IRA withdrawal (which is usually penalty-free if used for college), make the withdrawal in January of the sophomore year in college.

If you have a choice of when to realize income, it is best to realize it in a year not relevant for the EFC. For example, if you plan to sell stock for a capital gain, selling three years before the student begins college, or in January of the student's sophomore year, will prevent the capital gain from increasing your EFC.

===Converting assets to non-counted assets===
While assets are counted at a much lower rate, they are counted as long as they remain assets. A student who has a $1000 bank account and does not touch it will increase the EFC by $200 for every year of college. Any assets which are spent will not be counted in net worth for subsequent years.

However, even if assets are not spent, they can be moved into a non-counted category. If you can afford to contribute to a retirement plan while your children are in college, the contribution will still count as income for that year, but it will not count as an asset in future years. Likewise, if you pay down your home mortgage or other non-investment debts such as auto loans, this will not increase your reported net worth; if you instead pay down the mortgage on an investment property, this will increase the net worth of the investment property. 

Students can also take advantage of converting assets to non-counted assets. If a student earns income in high school or college which they do not need to spend, they can contribute to a Roth IRA and not have the savings counted for the EFC.

===Student versus parental money===
Since student assets and income are counted at a much higher rate than parental assets, it will reduce the EFC if the parent has more of the assets and income. Therefore, spending the student's assets for their benefit (for example, using the student's money to buy a computer) will reduce the EFC.

'''Series EE Savings Bonds''' (often called '''EE Bonds''') are government savings bonds issued by the U.S. Treasury. First issued in 1980 as a replacement for the series E Savings Bonds, they have been offered ever since, though the rules applying to the bonds have changed several times. EE Bonds issued after May 2005 earn a fixed rate of interest based on the issue date of the bond. Other forms of treasury securities include [[I savings bonds]] and [[TIPS]].

==Rates and terms==
The rules governing EE Savings Bonds are complex, and have been changed several times since they were first issued. For more information, see [http://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/research/indepth/ebonds/res_e_bonds_eeratesandterms.htm EE/E Bonds Rates &amp; Terms] from TreasuryDirect. To find out what your bonds are worth today, use the [http://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/tools/tools_savingsbondcalc.htm Savings Bond Calculator] or the [http://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/tools/tools_savingsbondwizard.htm Savings Bond Wizard].

===Bonds issued after May 2005===
EE Bonds issued after May 2005 earn a fixed rate in effect at the time of purchase. They must be held for a minimum of one year. Bonds redeemed within five years must pay a 3-month interest penalty. They are guaranteed to double in value in 20 years, which equals a guaranteed return of 3.5% a year. For more information, see [http://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/research/indepth/ebonds/res_e_bonds_eeratesandterms.htm#may2005 rates and terms] from TreasuryDirect.

===Bonds issued between May 1997 and April 2005===
EE Bonds issued between May 1997 and April 2005 earn 90% of the average yields on 5-year Treasury notes for the preceding six months. The rate is adjusted every six months. Bonds redeemed within five years must pay a 3-month interest penalty. EE Bonds issued between May 1995 and May 2003 are guaranteed to double in value in 17 years, which equals a guaranteed return of 4.16% a year. EE Bonds issued after June 1, 2003 are guaranteed to double in value in 20 years, which equals a guaranteed return of 3.5% a year. For more information, see [http://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/research/indepth/ebonds/res_e_bonds_eeratesandterms_eebondsissued051995_042005.htm#may97 rates and terms] from TreasuryDirect.

===Bonds issued between May 1995 and April 1997===
EE Bonds issued between May 1995 and April 1997 earn a short-term rate in the first five years. Between five years and 17 years, the bonds earn a long-term rate. They are guaranteed to double in value in 17 years, which equals a guaranteed return of 4.16% a year. After 17-years, they earn the rates in effect at that time. For more information, see [http://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/research/indepth/ebonds/res_e_bonds_eeratesandterms_eebondsissued051995_042005.htm#may95 rates and terms] from TreasuryDirect.

===Bonds issued before May 1995===
Before May 1995, all EE Bonds issued earned a graduated, fixed rate of interest for the first five years. After five years and until the maturity date, the bonds earned either the guaranteed minimum rate (determined by the date of issue) or a market-based rate, whichever was higher. For more information, see [http://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/research/indepth/ebonds/res_e_bonds_eeratesandterms_eebondsissuedbefore051995.htm rates and terms] from TreasuryDirect.

==Features==
As of January 1, 2012, paper savings bonds are no longer sold. This action supports Treasury’s goal to increase the number of electronic transactions with citizens and businesses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treasurydirect.gov/news/pressroom/pressroom_comotcend0711.htm Treasury to End Over-the-Counter Sales of Paper U.S. Savings Bonds], TreasuryDirect, July 13, 2011, Viewed September 21, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Electronic versions of EE Bonds are available, limited to $10,000 per year per Social Security Number. Savings bonds purchased as gifts aren't included in your annual limit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/research/articles/res_invest_articles_purchaselimits_0406.htm Purchase Limits], from TreasuryDirect.gov.&lt;/ref&gt;
* EE Bonds are not marketable securities, meaning that, unlike other bonds and stocks, you cannot trade EE Bonds in the secondary market.
* EE Bonds are free from state and local taxation. (See below.)

==Where to purchase==
You can buy electronic EE Bonds at [http://www.savingsbonds.gov/indiv/indiv.htm TreasuryDirect].

==How to redeem==
Those wishing to redeem paper savings bonds should first check their financial institution for redemption instructions. Bonds can also be redeemed by mail at the Treasury Retail Securities Site.

Paper bonds can also be converted to electronic form.

Bonds which have not matured, but were lost, stolen or destroyed, must have them reissued in electronic form.

See [http://www.savingsbonds.gov/indiv/products/prod_eebonds_glance.htm Series EE Savings Bonds] for complete details.

==Taxes==
EE Savings Bonds are not subject to state or local taxes, and all federal taxes can be deferred until redemption or the end of the extended maturity period.

===Tax-free growth for qualified education expenses===

If EE Bonds issued after 1989 are redeemed for qualifying education expenses, the interest is completely tax free, provided certain conditions are met. According to [http://www.irs.gov/publications/p970/ch10.html IRS Publication 970, Tax Benefits for Education], the tax-free redemption requires the following conditions to be met:

* You pay qualified educational expenses for yourself, your spouse, or a dependent for whom you claim an exemption on your return.
* Your modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) is less than $92,200 ($145,750 if married filing jointly or qualifying widow(er)).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/uac/about-form-8815 |title=Form 8815, Exclusion of Interest From Series EE and I U.S. Savings Bonds Issued After 1989 |author= IRS |date=Aug 29, 2016 |website=|access-date=18 September 2016}}, Viewed 18-September 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; You cannot exclude any of the interest if your modified adjusted gross income is equal to or more than the upper limit. The phaseout, if any, is figured for you when you fill out [http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f8815.pdf Form 8815]. The MAGI thresholds are adjusted annually.
* Your filing status is not married filing separately.
* The bond must be issued either in your name (as the sole owner) or in the name of both you and your spouse (as co-owners).
* The owner of the Savings Bonds must be at least 24 years old before the bond's issue date. (The issue date is printed on the front of the Savings Bond.)
* The full proceeds of the savings bond redemption (both interest and principal) must be used for qualifying educational expenses.i
Note that redeeming EE Bonds to contribute to a [[529 plan]] or a [[Coverdell Education Savings Accounts (ESAs)|Coverdell education savings account]] is also considered a qualified educational expense. See [http://www.irs.gov/publications/p970/ch10.html Publication 970 (2010), Tax Benefits for Education] for more details.

==Redeeming EE savings bonds==
EE Savings Bonds must be held for 12 months before they can be redeemed; an exception may apply if the bondholder is affected by a disaster such as a flood, fire, hurricane, or tornado.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/research/indepth/ebonds/res_e_bonds_eeredeem_disaster.htm Individual - Redeem or Replace Bonds in Areas Affected by Disaster], Treasury Direct, viewed 2 February 2014. &lt;/ref&gt;

EE Bonds redeemed before five years will lose the last three months of interest.

EE Bonds earn interest for 30 years. After 30 years EE bonds stop earning interest and should be redeemed.

The bonds can be redeemed by following the instructions at TreasuryDirect: [https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/research/indepth/ebonds/res_e_bonds_eeredeem.htm Redeeming (Cashing) EE and E Savings Bonds].

==Role in a portfolio==
An ideal use &lt;nowiki&gt;[in a portfolio]&lt;/nowiki&gt; is to help you to defer taking [[Social Security]]. A rule of thumb is that each year you delay retirement and the onset of your Social Security payments will increase your benefits by 8%. If you buy a $10,000 savings bond each year starting at age 42, you assure yourself $20,000 in annual income beginning at age 62. That can help tide you over until you reach 70, when Social Security payments max out.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2016/09/16/uncle-sam-pays-almost-twice-the-yield-on-treasurys-if-you-know-where-to-look/|title=Uncle Sam Pays Almost Twice the Yield on Treasurys — If You Know Where to Look |last1=Zweig |first1= Jason |date=September 16, 2016 |publisher= Wall Street Journal|access-date=September 18, 2016}} Also see this {{Forum post|t=199723|title="Uncle Sam Pays Almost Twice The Yield On Treasurys--If You Know Where To Look}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Series I Savings Bonds''' (often called '''I Bonds''') are government savings bonds issued by the U.S. Treasury that offer inflation protection. I Bonds offer tax-deferral for up to 30 years and are free from state and local taxation. I Bonds are not marketable securities and cannot be traded in the secondary market.

Note: [[Treasury Inflation Protected Securities]] (TIPS) also provide inflation protection. TIPS are considered alternatives to I Bonds. See [[I Bonds vs TIPS]] for similarities and differences between the two instruments.

==History==

I bonds were first issued in September, 1998. Historical interest rates, along with computation metrics, for I bond issues can be found at [http://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/research/indepth/ibonds/res_ibonds_iratesandterms.htm TreasuryDirect].

==Rates and terms==
===Composite rate===
I Bonds have two components that make up their composite rate (total yield): a fixed rate and an inflation rate.
* The '''fixed rate''' is fixed for the entire life of any given I Bond. The fixed rate for newly-issued I Bonds is announced on May 1 and November 1 of each year, and applies to all I Bonds issued during that six month period.
* The '''inflation rate''' is based on the Consumer Price Index and is also announced every six months, on May 1 and November 1. The May rate is based on the change in the CPI-U from the previous September to March and the November rate on the change from March to September. This inflation adjustment applies to both existing I Bonds and newly-issued ones, but the timing of that adjustment is dependent on the original issue date of any particular I Bond.

The composite rate can never go below zero, which protects investors in times of deflation.

Interest accrues monthly and compounds semiannually.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treasurydirect.gov/news/pressroom/currenteebondratespr.htm Nov 2009 TreasuryDirect Press Release Announcing the New Rates]&lt;/ref&gt; The accrual date is the first of the month, and the redemption value does not change between accrual dates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/retrieveECFR?gp=1&amp;SID=fb5d179703df8bce0b33b2d270075490&amp;ty=HTML&amp;h=L&amp;n=31y2.1.1.1.55&amp;r=PART#31:2.1.1.1.55.1.17.4 31 CFR 359.3]&lt;/ref&gt; This means that on each 6th month anniversary of the issue date the value of the bond is increased by the interest earned during that 6 month period. However, until the bond is owned for 5 years, the value of the bond is reduced by the latest 3 months worth of interest which is a penalty for selling early. After 5 years of ownership there is no penalty and the full value of interest earned is included in the bond value shown on the Treasury Direct site. An additional restriction is that the bond may not be redeemed until it has been held for 12 months.

===Six-month cycle of composite earnings rates===
I Bond interest is calculated in six month cycles, based on the original date of issue. Each I Bond's composite rate (fixed and inflation) remains in effect for a total of six months, and then changes to a combination of that I Bond's fixed rate plus the most recently announced inflation adjustment for the next six months. That cycle continues for the life of an I Bond:

An example of the composite rate calculation using I bonds issued May 2009 - Oct. 2009:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.savingsbonds.gov/indiv/research/indepth/ibonds/res_ibonds_iratesandterms.htm I Savings Bonds Rates &amp; Terms]&lt;/ref&gt;

:Given a Fixed rate = 0.10% and a Semiannual inflation rate = -2.78%

:Composite rate = [Fixed rate + (2 x Semiannual inflation rate) + (Fixed rate x Semiannual inflation rate)]
:Composite rate = [0.0010 + (2 &amp;times; -0.0278) + (0.0010 &amp;times; -0.0278)]
:Composite rate = [0.0010 + (-0.0556) + (-0.0000278)]
:Composite rate = [-0.0546278]
:Composite rate = -0.0546
:Composite rate = -5.46%
:Composite rate = 0.00% (Composite rates are never less than zero)

===How the formula works===

If the inflation rate during the six months the composite rate applies is the same as the inflation rate from the previous period used in the computation of the composite rate, the pre-tax real return is the fixed rate. Example: assume a fixed rate of 1% and a semi-annual inflation rate of 1.5%. The [[#Composite rate | composite rate]] = [.01 + (2 &amp;times; .015) + (.01 &amp;times; .015)] = .04015. After six months, $1 invested in the I bond is worth 

:(1 + .04015/2) = 1.020075, and what used to cost $1 now costs 1.015 after inflation.

Before, $1 would buy 1.0 item that cost $1. Now you have $1.020075, but the item now costs $1.015. You can now buy

:1.020075/1.015 = 1.005 items, 0.5% more than before.

Your real return for the six months is 0.5%. This produces an annual real return of 1.0% (the fixed rate), compounded every six months (the actual real return after one year is greater than 1.0% because of the compounding).

===How interest is calculated===
All bond values are based on the $25 bond. A $5000 bond is worth 200 times what a $25 bond is worth; a $100 bond is worth 4 times what a $25 bond is worth. If you have a $80 electronic bond at TreasuryDirect, it is worth 3.2 $25 bonds. The $25 bond value is always rounded to the nearest penny. Thus, a $5000 bond must always have a value that is a multiple of $2.00.

Interest is computed on a $25 bond using the composite rate divided by 2 for the given six month period. For individual months within the six month period, interest is computed using pseudo-monthly compounding to produce the same result after six months. For example, if the composite rate is 2.57%, the bond value after

:1 month&amp;nbsp; is $25 &amp;times; (1 + 0.0257/2)^(1/6) = $25.05, and after
:4 months is $25 &amp;times; (1 + 0.0257/2)^(4/6) = $25.21, and after
:6 months is $25 &amp;times; (1 + 0.0257/2)^(6/6) = $25.32.

The values of a $100 bond would be $100.20, $100.84, and $101.28 after those same time periods. Note that this ignores the 3 month penalty for redemption within the first 5 years and the restriction on redemption within the first year.

===Current interest rates and I Bond value===
To find out the current interest rate of I Bonds and the worth of your bonds, the following resources of [http://www.savingsbonds.gov/tdhome.htm TreasuryDirect] may be used:
* [http://www.savingsbonds.gov/indiv/research/indepth/ibonds/res_ibonds_iratesandterms.htm I Savings Bonds Rates and Terms]
* [http://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/tools/tools_savingsbondcalc.htm Savings Bond Calculator]
* [http://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/tools/tools_savingsbondwizard.htm Savings Bond Wizard]

The website [https://www.eyebonds.info/ibonds/home10000.html eyebonds.info] can also be useful to determine the interest rate and worth of your bonds based on when they are purchased.

==Purchase and redemption==
===Who can own I Bonds===
Savings bonds may be owned not only by individuals, but by ''entities'', such as trusts, estates of deceased persons, living estates [where a court has appointed a guardian for a person, such as one who is incompetent], corporations, and partnerships.&lt;ref name="register"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/research/indepth/ibonds/registeringibonds.htm| title=Registering a Savings Bond: Series I | publisher=TreasuryDirect| accessdate=July 19, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individual adults can buy savings bonds for children under the age of 18 and register the bonds in the name of a child or children.&lt;ref name="register" /&gt;

Entities are permitted to open accounts in TreasuryDirect. An entity account must be opened by an individual (known as the entity account manager) who can legally act alone when managing the account on behalf of the entity or organization.&lt;ref name="entity"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/help/TDHelp/help_ug_292-EntityAccountsLearnMore.htm| title=Learn More About Entity Accounts | publisher=TreasuryDirect| accessdate=July 19, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The references to "you" and "your" in this article refer to the primary account holder, which can be an individual or an entity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?cb&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se31.2.363_16&amp;rgn=div8| title=§363.6 What special terms do I need to know to understand this part? | publisher= Electronic Code of Federal Regulations (e-CFR) |series= 31 CFR §363.6 |quote= ''You or your'' refers to a TreasuryDirect primary account holder. | accessdate=July 19, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Direct purchase===
I Bonds are sold at face value; for example, you would pay $100 for a $100 I Bond. I Bonds are not marketable securities, meaning that, unlike other bonds and stocks, you cannot trade I Bonds in the secondary market.
* '''Electronic I Bonds''' - You can buy electronic I Bonds at [http://www.savingsbonds.gov/indiv/indiv.htm TreasuryDirect]. Purchases may be made in amounts of $25 or more, to the penny.
* '''Purchase limits''' - $10,000 maximum purchase in one calendar year, with an additional $5,000 in paper I Bonds per Social Security number using your IRS tax refund.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/research/indepth/ebonds/res_e_bonds_eecomparison.htm I and EE Savings Bond Comparison], from TreasuryDirect.gov.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* '''Paper I Bonds''' - Paper I Bonds may be replaced if they were lost, stolen, mutilated, or never received.&lt;ref group="note" name="Replace"&gt;The process for replacing paper I bonds can be found at TreasuryDirect.gov: [https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/research/indepth/ibonds/res_ibonds_ireplace.htm Individual - Replacing or Reissuing a Paper I Bond]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gifts===
Savings bonds purchased as gifts are not included in your annual purchase limit.&lt;ref name="TreasDirect"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/research/articles/res_invest_articles_purchaselimits_0406.htm| title=Purchase Limits | publisher=TreasuryDirect| accessdate=July 19, 2021}} and {{cite web| url=https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?mc=true&amp;node=se31.2.363_152&amp;rgn=div8| title=§363.52 What is the principal amount of book-entry Series EE and Series I savings bonds that I may acquire in one year? | publisher= Electronic Code of Federal Regulations (e-CFR) |series= 31 CFR §363.52 | accessdate=July 19, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Savings bonds received as gifts are applied to the receiver's annual purchase limit in the year the transaction occurs (when they are delivered to the recipient).&lt;ref name="TreasDirect" /&gt;

Savings bonds purchased as gifts begin accruing interest the month they are purchased and will have a maturity date 30 years after the purchase month. 

In order to purchase savings bonds as a gift, you will need to know the recipient’s Social Security Number. This allows you to register the individual and purchase the bonds, placing them into your Gift Box in Treasury Direct. There is a waiting period of 5 business days for the funds to clear. After the funds clear, they may be transferred to the recipient using their Treasury Direct account number.

'''Example 1:''' Your aunt buys $10k of I bonds as a gift for you in December 2020. She delivers the gift to you in January 2021. You have now acquired $10k of I bonds in 2021. You are not allowed to buy even $1 worth of I bonds for yourself, although you could buy $100k worth as gifts for others.

'''Example 2:''' You purchase $10k of I bonds as a gift for your spouse on October 15, 2022. The bond will begin accruing interest in October 2022 but remain in your Gift Box until you manually deliver the bond from your account. The bond will have an Issue Date of 10-01-2022 and Maturity Date of 10-01-2052.

===Conversion===
If you have paper I Bonds, you may convert any or all of these paper bonds to electronic bonds. This conversion does ''not'' apply to your annual purchase limit of $10,000 in electronic I-Bonds (see quote on the side from the IRS website).
{{Quote
|quote = '''Conversion'''
"There is no limit on how many previously-issued paper bonds can be converted to electronic securities in your TreasuryDirect account in a single year."

'''Redeem Bonds'''

"To redeem electronic bonds purchased in ''TreasuryDirect'', log in and follow the on-screen directions. Your checking or savings account will be credited with the redemption amount within one business day of the redemption date.

You can cash your I Bonds at most local financial institutions. Treasury doesn’t maintain a listing of local banks that redeem bonds, so check with the banks in your area. When you present the bonds, you’ll be asked to establish your identity. You can do this by:

* Being a customer with an active account open for at least 6 months at the financial institution that will be paying the bonds, or
* Presenting documentary identification, such as a driver's license.

If you're not listed as the owner or co-owner on the bonds you're redeeming, you'll have to establish that you're entitled to redeem the bonds. It's always a good idea to check with your financial institution before presenting the bonds for payment to find out what identification and other documents you need. "

[http://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/research/indepth/ibonds/res_ibonds_iredeem.htm Treasury Direct:Redeem I Savings Bonds]}}
===Redemption===
I Bonds cannot be redeemed during the first year, and if you redeem them within the first five years after purchase, you lose the most recent three months' interest. When you redeem your I Bonds, you can never get back less than you invested, even if there was a long period of negative inflation (deflation).

==Tax benefits==
===Tax-deferred growth===

Interest from I Bonds accumulates tax-deferred for up to 30 years. (I Bonds do not distribute interest like CDs and other bonds do.) After 30 years, the I Bonds reach final maturity and no longer earn any additional interest. When I Bonds mature or are redeemed, the interest is taxable income for federal income tax purposes, but is free from state and local taxation. However, if the entire proceeds of the I Bond redemption (both principal and interest) are used for qualifying educational expenses, the interest can be tax-free at the federal level (see below). You also have the choice of paying income taxes on the accrued interest each year (which may be advantageous if a bond is titled in a child's name). 

Both "redemption" and "maturity" of savings bonds are taxable events, whichever occurs first is when the bond is taxed.&lt;ref&gt; According to [https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/research/indepth/ibonds/res_ibonds_itaxconsider.htm Series I Savings Bonds Tax Considerations].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tax-free growth for qualified education expenses===

If I Bonds are redeemed for qualifying education expenses, the interest is completely tax free, provided certain conditions are met.

====Conditions====
According to [http://www.irs.gov/publications/p970/ch10.html Publication 970 (2009), Tax Benefits for Education], the tax-free redemption requires the following conditions to be met:

* You pay qualified educational expenses for yourself, your spouse, or a dependent for whom you claim an exemption on your return.
* Your modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) is less than $84,950 for single taxpayers ($134,900 if married filing jointly or qualifying widow(er)). The amount of your interest exclusion is gradually reduced (phased out) if your modified adjusted gross income is between $69,950 and $84,950 (between $104,900 and $134,900 if your filing status is married filing jointly or qualifying widow(er)). You cannot exclude any of the interest if your modified adjusted gross income is equal to or more than the upper limit.The phaseout, if any, is figured for you when you fill out [http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f8815.pdf Form 8815]. The MAGI numbers are adjusted annually.
* Your filing status is not married filing separately.
* The owner of the Savings Bonds must be at least 24 years old before the bond's issue date. (The issue date is printed on the front of the Savings Bond.)
* The full proceeds of the savings bond redemption (both interest and principal) must be used for qualifying educational expenses.

====529 plans====
Note that redeeming I Bonds to contribute to a [[529 plan]] or a [[Coverdell Education Savings Accounts (ESAs)|Coverdell education savings account]] is also considered a qualified educational expense. To take advantage of this, file IRS [http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f8815.pdf Form 8815] to claim an exclusion for the interest after rolling the proceeds of these US Savings Bonds into a section 529 college savings plan or Coverdell Education Savings account. Write "529 College Savings Plan" or "Coverdell Education Savings Account" in the answer to 1(b), where it asks for the name of the educational institution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finaid.org/savings/529plans.phtml#Contributions FinAid Section 529 Plans]&lt;/ref&gt;. Note that there are certain restrictions, such as the fact that the child beneficiary cannot be listed as a co-owner on the bonds. See [http://www.irs.gov/publications/p970/ch10.html Publication 970 (2009), Tax Benefits for Education] for more details.

====Modified AGI limits====
As of 2013, for all other filing statuses, your interest exclusion is phased out if your modified AGI is between $72,850 and $87,850 (filing single) or between $109,250 and $139,250 (married filing jointly)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/planning/plan_education.htm Education Planning], from TreasuryDirect.&lt;/ref&gt;. You cannot take the exclusion if your modified AGI is above those limits. You are disqualified from the interest exclusion if you are married filing separately. For more information, see chapter 11 in Publication 970, Tax Benefits for Education.

If you expect to be above the MAGI levels the following year, it may be prudent to use I-Bonds for qualified educational expenses (such as using them to fund a 529 plan) in the current year, to avoid paying taxes on the interest.

==Role in a portfolio==

* If your tax-advantaged accounts are filled up with bond funds, you can "extend" your tax-advantaged accounts by purchasing I Bonds in your taxable account. This process is somewhat similar, but not identical, to placing Treasury Inflation Protected Securities in your [[Non-deductible Traditional IRA]]. Buying I Bonds in your taxable account is particularly useful if your tax bracket is too low to justify owning tax-exempt bonds in your taxable account.
* If you are desperately looking for tax-advantaged space to hold tax-inefficient assets like REITs, you can free up some of your tax-advantaged space by purchasing I Bonds in your taxable account and then exchanging a part of the bond allocation in your tax-advantaged account to a REIT fund.
* If you have a tax-free growth account like a Roth IRA, but no tax-deferred account like a Traditional IRA, you may want to place stocks in the Roth IRA while buying I Bonds in your taxable account to make the maximum use of the tax-free growth in the Roth IRA.
* I-bonds older than 1 year can serve as an emergency fund if you can absorb the 3-month interest penalty; otherwise I-bonds at least 5 years old serve as an emergency fund just fine. The yield can at times be higher than money market funds or bank savings accounts.

==Caveats==
===Redemption while in a high tax bracket===

I Bonds redeemed when the investor is in a high tax bracket may provide little or no positive after-tax, after-inflation return, especially if they are held for shorter periods of time. For this reason, if you expect to be in a high tax bracket when you redeem your I Bonds, they may not be a suitable investment for you. Specifically, if you are in your 20s, in 30 years you may well be in your peak earning years, which means you would probably be in a high tax bracket when the bonds mature.

To illustrate the point, here is the after-tax, after-inflation value of $1 invested in I bonds compounded for 30 years (60 semi-annual periods) with 3% inflation and a 1% fixed rate and then redeemed in the 35% federal income tax bracket:

:(1 + ((1 + 0.04015/2)^60 - 1) &amp;times; (1 - 0.35)) / (1.03^30) = $1.02671191
:where 0.04015 is the [[#Composite rate | composite rate]] (.01 + (2 &amp;times; .015) + (.01 &amp;times; .015) = .04015) and 0.0415/2 is the rate that is compounded every 6 months (60 times in 30 years)

This is equivalent to a real after-tax return of 0.088%/year.

==Tips for buying I Bonds==
Since I Bonds earn the full month's interest if you own them on the last day of that month, it is generally a good idea to buy I Bonds at the end of a month after also earning interest on that same money in a bank account during most of that same month. Conversely, you would want to redeem your I Bonds at the beginning of any month, since holding them until later in the month will not earn any additional interest, unless you own them on the last day of the month.

A '''529 plan''' is a tax-advantaged savings plan designed to encourage saving for future college costs. The plans enable individuals tax-deferral of income and capital gains, and tax-free distributions for qualified education costs. 529 plans are termed "qualified tuition plans" by the IRS, which authorized the plans in 1996 in Section 529 of the Internal Revenue Code.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/26/529.html Section 529 of the Internal Revenue Code] &lt;/ref&gt; The 529 plan provisions were made more secure by the 2006 Pension Preservation Act.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tiaa-cref.org/pubs/pdf/pension_protection_act.pdf 2006 Pension Preservation Act] &lt;/ref&gt; 529 plans are sponsored by states and private education institutions.

There are two categories of 529 plans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=July 2021|title=What’s the Difference between Custodial and Individual 529 Plan Accounts?|url=https://www.virginia529.com/blog/whats-the-difference-between-custodial-and-individual-529-plan-accounts/|access-date=February 4, 2022|website=Virginia 529|publisher=Virginia College Savings Plan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Plans owned by someone other than the beneficiary.
* Plans owned by the beneficiary (either as an adult or as a minor owner of a UTMA 529 plan or Custodial 529 plan).

A 529 plan can only have one owner (also sometimes called donor). Thus, it is very important for 529 plan holders to name a successor owner to take over the ownership rights of the plan in case of the original owner's death.

The owner of a plan who is not the beneficiary may transfer all the assets to a new plan for the benefit of another person or withdraw the money for the owner’s personal use, denying the original beneficiary of the benefit of the contributions to the plan. When a minor owns a Custodial 529, the custodian must act in the best interest of the minor, which precludes the custodian removing any assets from the plan for the benefit of another.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=UGMA &amp; UTMA Custodial Accounts|url=https://finaid.org/savings/ugma/|access-date=February 4, 2022|website=finaid.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within each category, there are two types of 529 plans: '''pre-paid tuition plans''', which can be offered by states or private institutions, and '''college savings plans''' which can only be sponsored by states. 529 savings plans can be sold directly to investors without [[Mutual funds and fees#Sales Fees |sales charges]], or can be sold through advisor sold plans with sales charges.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/intro529.htm An Introduction to 529 Plans], SEC.&lt;/ref&gt;

The law is quite liberal in allowing contributions to a child's 529 plan. Relatives, friends, and even complete strangers can make contributions (although all contributions, once made, are under the control of the account owner). The Federal government requires states to impose limits on contributions based on the expected cost of undergraduate and graduate educations. State accumulation limitations on 529 savings plans range from $146,000 to $397,000 (typically aggregated per beneficiary across all plans with that state). The limits have risen steadily over the years with inflation. Additionally some 529 plans limit contributions (not just aggregated accumulations). Unlike many personal retirement accounts and [[Coverdell Education Savings Accounts]], there are no income restrictions placed on who can open and fund a 529 plan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finaid.org/savings/529plans.phtml#Contributions  FinAid Section 529 Plans]&lt;/ref&gt;

Contributions to a 529 are considered completed gifts for estate and gift tax purposes, so any amount contributed is not part of the contributor's estate (not withstanding the ability of the owner to deprive the beneficiary of any and all benefits), but is part of the beneficiary's estate.
 
The account owner maintains control of a 529 plan. This includes the power to name a successor owner: to name and change beneficiaries; the ability to exchange one 529 plan for another; to allocate plan assets in 529 savings plans; and the power to disperse funds, or even terminate the plan. 

There are no limits as to the number of 529 plans that can be held for a beneficiary. For example, an investor could hold both a 529 prepaid or tuition indexed plan and a 529 savings plan for the same beneficiary.

The 2017 tax reform expanded the applicability of 529 plans beyond college, to include primary and secondary education.

* ''Guaranteed.''  Accounts are guaranteed by state governments to at least match in-state college tuition increases.
*'' Low-risk.''  Prepaid savings plans are considered a safe investment option for families that know where their children will go to college. They usually outperform typical savings accounts or CDs.&lt;ref name="collegeboard"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Downsides of Prepaid Savings Plans:'''
* ''Limited to state residents.''  Participation in the plans is often restricted to state residents or alumni of state colleges and universities.
* ''Geared toward in-state public institutions.''  Your principal plus earnings may not cover tuition and fees if the student decides to attend a private or out-of-state college or university.
* ''Conservative.''  For long-term college savers (with at least five years until their student attends college), there may be more productive investing options.
* ''Refund/cancellation costs.''  Pulling out of a prepaid tuition plan can result in stiff penalties, including a cancellation cost and/or loss of interest.
* ''Narrow definition of college expenses.''  For some plans, funds can only be applied to tuition and fees. Expenses such as room and board, course fees, and books, fall on the family to cover. Other plans allow funds to be used for such expenses if a family ends up with excess tuition units or if tuition and fees are reduced by scholarships.

Bear in mind that each 529 plan has its own set of rules and restrictions, which are subject to change. Make sure to request the most recent plan details from the plan administrators.&lt;ref name="collegeboard"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Benefits of 529 saving plans:'''

*''Open to anyone.'' There are zero residency restrictions and no cap on income level 
*''Easy to manage.''  Set up an account and your money is managed for you. 
*'' Low impact on financial aid.''  Savings are treated as a parental asset when aid is determined, which means that only 5.6 percent or less of the account's value is factored into calculating the [[Expected Family Contribution]] (EFC) for each academic year.
* ''Can be used at most schools.''  Funds are good at most accredited public or private colleges or universities, community colleges, graduate schools, in the U.S. Some plans also recognize accredited vocational and international colleges.
* ''The account holder controls the money.''  The parent or grandparent controls the money for the life of the account, even after the beneficiary turns 18.
*'' Large contributions are possible.''  Some plans have contribution limits as high as $305,000 per beneficiary.
*'' Gift tax exemptions.''  Contribute up to $14,000 annually without triggering any gift tax. You also have the option to make a lump sum contribution between $14,000 and $70,000, which is treated as if it was made over a five-year period.&lt;ref name= "529 Plan"&gt;[http://www.collegeboard.com/parents/pay/scholarships-aid/21392.html 529 Savings Plans], collegeboard.com&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Downsides of 529 saving plans:'''

* ''Risk.''  These plans are not guaranteed to make a profit—accounts can post losses in a tough stock market. Parents must be aware of the risks, and be prepared in case they come up short.
* ''Short track record.''  Most programs have only been around a few years.
* ''Limited choices. '' Account holders have a fairly limited range of investment choices, but new options (and new plans) are being introduced constantly.
* ''Less disclosure.''  States are not required to share their performance with investors on a regular basis.
* ''Account manager fees.'' These are higher than average, and can be as much as 1-2 percent of annual earnings.&lt;ref name= "529 Plan"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;I"

Prepaid tuition plans allow families to purchase the cost of future college tuition at present-day prices. The state offers a guarantee that the value of the investment will meet or exceed annual in-state public college tuition inflation. The price you will pay for such protection will vary, depending on the age of the student (lower for a young child; higher for older children) and, of course, the cost of tuition. There are two types of prepaid tuition plans, a '''units plan''' and a '''contract plan'''. A units plan allows you to buy units of tuition (for example, a unit could equal one percent of state college tuition). A contract plan lets you purchase contracts for one to five years of tuition. Account holders can usually contribute to either of the two plan types in a lump sum or in installments.&lt;ref name ="collegeboard"&gt;[http://www.collegeboard.com/parents/pay/scholarships-aid/21391.html 529 Prepaid Plans], collegeboard.com&lt;/ref&gt; Investors can open a prepaid plan when the plans enter a limited open enrollment period, usually once a year. The prepaid plan will reveal its new tuition pricing with each new enrollment period. Prepaid plans can and do suspend enrollment periods. Timely information on a plan's enrollment period and current pricing are conveniently available on the Saving for College links in the second table below.

Prepaid plans can be costly if you decide to pull out the plan. Such action can result in stiff penalties, including a cancellation cost and/or loss of interest (see sidebar.) Prepaid plans also face the risk  of funding shortfalls due to either portfolio losses or stresses due to economic downturns.&lt;ref&gt; See [http://www.savingforcollege.com/articles/prepaid-529-plans-at-risk  Prepaid 529 woes: Bail out or sail on?])&lt;/ref&gt;

==529 college savings plans==
529 savings plans are state-sponsored investment accounts. 529 portfolios are very similar to mutual funds and are managed by mutual fund companies. Assets inside a 529 savings plan can grow tax-deferred and are distributed tax free when used for [[529 plans#Tax considerations | "qualified education expenses"]]. Unlike pre-paid tuition plans, the results you get from a 529 savings plan depend on market performance and are not guaranteed. 529 savings plans offer greater flexibility of investment choices and can be used to pay for qualified expenses at any qualified institution. You are free to choose among any of the 529 savings plans issued by the 50 states and the District of Columbia.

For a side by side comparison of Prepaid and College Savings plans, please refer to this [https://www.finra.org/investors/learn-to-invest/types-investments/saving-for-education/college-savings-comparison-chart chart from FINRA].

===529 plan investment programs===
[[Image:Age-based.jpg |thumb |300px]| Ohio Age Based 529 Savings Plan]]
[[Image:V Fund Age Based Options09.jpg|thumb|left|300px | North Carolina Age-Based Plan]]

529 savings plans typically employ three main types of investment programs; age-based portfolios, static [[Fund of funds |fund of funds]] portfolios, and standalone single asset class portfolios. Many states offer multiple 529 savings plans, often providing a direct-sold plan and an advisor (commissioned) sold plan. Many states provide both actively managed and indexed portfolios.

*'''Age-based portfolios''': Age-based portfolios are designed primarily for children beneficiaries. They are broadly diversified fund of funds portfolios that set allocations based upon a child's present age. The fund automatically changes allocations to more conservative postures as the child matures. The portfolios' [[Glide paths | glide paths]] normally run from birth to age 17 or 18, the time of expected matriculation. The figure to the right (click image to enlarge) shows the [[Asset allocation | asset allocation]] and glide path of one of the Ohio 529 plan's age-based portfolios. The portfolio is largely allocated to equities at early ages, with the equity allocation declining over time, until the portfolio is largely allocated to cash and bonds at age 18. A common feature of many 529 savings plans are multiple risk-based Age-based options, usually including a Conservative, Moderate, and Aggressive portfolio option. The North Carolina age-based plan of Vanguard [[Vanguard funds: life strategy funds vs target retirement funds | Life Strategy ]]portfolios (figure on the left, click to enlarge) is an example of this type of offering. Asset allocations, glide paths, and returns can vary considerably among the eighty-odd 529 plan age-based portfolios.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.morningstar.com/articlenet/article.aspx?id=287783#page=0&amp;part=1 The Best and Worst 529 College-Savings Plans], Morningstar&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.savingforcollege.com/articles/age-based-investment-options-show-wide-variation Age-based investment options show wide variation] &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.savingforcollege.com/articles/asset-allocations-in-age-based-portfolios---direct Asset Allocations in Age-Based Portfolios - Direct] &lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Static fund of fund portfolios''': Another common offering in 529 savings plans is the static asset allocation fund of funds portfolio. These multiple fund portfolios maintain a constant asset allocation. These portfolios vary considerably. Some portfolios consist of stock funds, some are balanced across asset classes (stocks, international stocks, and fixed income). Some are exclusively invested in bond and money market funds. These funds allow an investor to choose an asset allocation and select the individual or multiple portfolios which match the desired allocation. The DFA portfolios in the [[West Virginia Smart 529 Select plan|West Virginia SMART 529 Select plan]] provide a good example, with a wide selection of these type funds.

*'''Standalone portfolios''': Some plans offer standalone asset class portfolios (see [[Virginia 529 plan]] for an example), These type funds allow an investor to design and execute a specific asset allocation plan with individual asset class funds. With both static fund of fund portfolios and standalone portfolios the investor must decide if, and when, the allocation needs to become more conservative as the time nears for dispersing plan assets.

==Investment considerations==
{{See also|529 plans by state}}
Saving to meet expected college education expenses is one means of paying for college costs. Other means of meeting this financial obligation include parents' paying college costs out of cash flow, student's paying tuition from job earnings, and getting assistance from financial aid (grants, scholarships, and student loans). It is often advised that parents fully fund their retirement savings before beginning a college savings program. Should you elect to fund a 529 savings plan, the following considerations should help you make prudent decisions. [Note: the important topic of making changes to 529 plans: rollovers, beneficiary changes, and account owners changes, are considered in [[529 plan account transfers‎]].]

'''Investment strategy:''' The investment of college savings in a 529 Savings Plan should follow the fundamental principles embedded in the [[Bogleheads investment philosophy]]: emphasis on low investment costs; broad diversification both within and among [[Asset class |asset classes]]; the use of low cost[[Indexing | index funds]] when available; and careful consideration of risk. Emphasizing low costs suggests that 529 savings plan investors should eschew the advisor sold 529 plans and select among plans that are directly sold.  All in annual expense ratios can vary widely by plan and by state, with directly sold plans ranging from as low as 0.1% to higher than 1.0%.  &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.savingforcollege.com/529-fee-study Saving for college 529 fee study]&lt;/ref&gt;Advisor sold plans will likely be higher. 
{| {{table}}

'''In state or out of state plan:'''
The selection of a 529 savings plan would optimally depend on the costs and investment selections offered by the plan. However, many states offer [[529 plans#state tax | tax incentives]]  to residents for investing in an in state plan. These incentives can include tax deductions for contributions, state matching payments for contributions, or a combination of the two incentives. These tax incentives can make a marginally more expensive in state 529 plan competitive with lower cost out of state plans. The following guidelines can help streamline the plan selection process.

# If your state of residence does not offer any tax incentives, simply confine your selection from among the lowest cost providers, either in state, or out of state, with investment selections acceptable to you.
# Five states (Arizona, Kansas, Maine, Minnesota, Missouri, and Pennsylvania) provide for tax deductible contributions to both in state and out of state 529 plans. You are free to select the lowest cost plan, either in state or out of state, with investment selections acceptable to you.
# If your state provides tax incentives for 529 plan contributions, you can use the following factors to determine the breakeven point where using a lower cost plan option becomes cheaper than a state plan providing tax deductible and/or matched 529 contributions:

:# The tax savings amount (Deductible contribution x marginal state tax rate) + match.
:# The cost differential between the plan and the lower cost plan.
:#Dividing (1) by (2) provides the capital accumulation point where the lower cost plan subsequently overtakes the tax benefit. You can find your state's marginal tax rates from [http://www.taxfoundation.org/taxdata/show/228.html Tax Data] available from  The Tax Foundation.

{{Notice|''Example:'' 
Herb and Susan Loughery are investigating their options for starting a 529 savings plan for their young son, David. Their in state plan provides investment portfolios managed by Vanguard at a 0.49% expense ratio.  Herb and Susan note that they can invest in similar investment portfolios managed by Vanguard in an out of state plan at a 0.31% expense ratio. Their home state allows Herb and Susan, as a married couple, to deduct $10,000 ($5,000 per person) per year of 529 contributions if they are contributed to the in state plan. Herb and Susan have a state marginal tax rate of 6.85%. In this instance they find that their planned $10,000 annual investment into the in state 529 plan will mean that they can accumulate $380,555 in the plan before it would become more expensive than the out of state plan (should the Loughery's either stop or lower their contribution level the threshold amount would, of course, drop.) In light of the generous tax incentive, Herb and Susan decide to opt for the in state 529 plan.}}

A number of states now recapture deducted 529 contribution taxes if a plan is transferred to an out of state plan. Refer to [[529 plan recapture tax on rollovers|this table]] for a list of these states.

== Tax considerations==
===Federal tax benefits===
Contributions to a 529 plan are not tax deductible on the federal tax return. However, earnings and capital appreciation are tax deferred in a 529 plan, and distributions are tax free for "qualified education expenses". According to the IRS "qualified expenses" are the amounts paid for tuition, fees, books, supplies, and equipment required for enrollment or attendance at an eligible educational institution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.savingforcollege.com/eligible_institutions/ eligible educational institution] &lt;/ref&gt; They also include the reasonable costs of room and board for a designated beneficiary who is at least a half-time student. The cost of room and board qualifies only to the extent that it is not more than the greater of the following two amounts.

:# The allowance for room and board, as determined by the eligible educational institution, that was included in the cost of attendance (for federal financial aid purposes) for a particular academic period and living arrangement of the student.
:# The actual amount charged if the student is residing in housing owned or operated by the eligible educational institution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irs.gov/publications/p970/ch08.html IRS Publication 570, Tax Benefits for Education]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Federal tax penalties===
Withdrawals from a 529 Savings Plan are considered non-qualified withdrawals if they are over the qualified education expenses. "Generally, if you receive a taxable distribution, you also must pay a 10% additional tax on the amount included in income."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irs.gov/publications/p970/ch08.html IRS Publication 570, Tax Benefits for Education]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.savingforcollege.com/intro_to_529s/what-is-the-penalty-on-an-unused-529-plan.php What is the penalty on an unused 529 plan?], savingforcollege.com &lt;/ref&gt; This 10% additional tax does not apply to distributions meeting the following exceptions:

:#Paid to a beneficiary (or to the estate of the designated beneficiary) on or after the death of the designated beneficiary.
:#Made because the designated beneficiary is disabled. A person is considered to be disabled if they show proof that they cannot do any substantial gainful activity because of their physical or mental condition. A physician must determine that their condition can be expected to result in death or to be of long-continued and indefinite duration.
:# Included in income because the designated beneficiary received:
:## A tax-free scholarship or fellowship,
:## Veterans' educational assistance,
:## Employer-provided educational assistance  or
:## Any other nontaxable (tax-free) payments (other than gifts or inheritances) received as educational assistance.
:# Made on account of the attendance of the designated beneficiary at a U.S. military academy (such as West Point). 
:# Included in income only because the qualified education expenses were taken into account in determining the Hope or lifetime learning credit .
Exception (3) applies only to the extent the distribution is not more than the scholarship, allowance, or payment.
The additional tax is figured on Part II of Form 5329.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irs.gov/publications/p970/ch08.html IRS Publication 570, Tax Benefits for Education]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Losses on 529 plan investments===

If you have a loss on your investment in a 529 account, you may be able to take the loss on your income tax return. You can take the loss only when all amounts from that account have been distributed and the total distributions are less than your unrecovered basis. Your basis is the total amount of contributions to that 529 account. You claim the loss as a miscellaneous itemized deduction on Schedule A (Form 1040), line 23 (Schedule A (Form 1040NR), line 11), subject to the 2%-of-adjusted- gross-income limit..&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irs.gov/publications/p970/ch08.html#en_US_publink100021058 IRS Pub 970] &lt;/ref&gt;

Distributions from other 529 accounts during the same year, even if the accounts have the same owner and beneficiary, do not impact the ability to deduct losses from a 529 account. This rule change in 2015 made it easier to deduct losses in 529 plans.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.irs.gov/irb/2016-07_IRB/ar06.html Internal Revenue Bulletin 2016-7  Notice 2016–13], February 16, 2016, viewed July 24, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

===State tax benefits===
{{See also|529 plan recapture tax on rollovers}}

States follow the federal tax system in allowing tax deferral of earnings and gains in a 529 Plan. Every state allows tax free withdrawals from both in-state and out-of-state 529 plans for qualified education expenses, with the exception of Alabama, which only exempts Alabama 529 plan qualified withdrawals. In addition, many states allow you to deduct or partially deduct 529 plan contributions on your state income tax return. Some states also offer a state match for plan contributions. This [http://www.finaid.org/savings/state529deductions.phtml State Tax Deductions for 529 Contributions table] provides a listing of all state tax deductions for 529 plans. Information is also available in [[529 plans by state#529 plan comparisons |529 plan comparisons]] (select a website, then check the box for "state tax deduction").

Some states impose a [[529 plan recapture tax on rollovers|recapture tax]] on prior tax deductions when a 529 plan is rolled over to another plan.

===Estate benefits===
529 Plans confer a potential estate tax benefit to donors. Contributions to a 529 Plan are removed from the donor's estate and are transferred to the estate of the beneficiary. If the total of all gifts to a single recipient in a year are under the annual gift tax exclusion ($16,000 in 2022), no gift tax return is required. A special tax provision allows an individual to contribute up to $80,000 to a 529 plan in a single year without incurring a gift tax. The  donation is, for gift tax purposes, spread over the ensuing five years.

The donations (prorated) are only brought back into the donor's estate if the donor dies or terminates the account within the five year extended period.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.finaid.org/savings/529plans.phtml#Contributions Saving for College], FinAid.com &lt;/ref&gt;

If you select the five year program you must elect it by filing the IRS Form 709 - the U.S. Gift (and Generation-Skipping Transfer) Tax return.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f709.pdf IRS Form 709 - the U.S. Gift (and Generation-Skipping Transfer) Tax return]&lt;/ref&gt;

If you are required to file a gift tax return in any of those five years, you must list that year’s 20% of the original contribution on that gift tax return, but there is no requirement to file a subsequent gift tax return otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Instructions for Form 709|url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i709.pdf|access-date=February 4, 2022|website=Internal Revenue Service|series=Line B. Qualified Tuition Programs (529 Plans or Programs)|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gift tax ===
If married, you and your spouse can each make contributions and give $32,000 total (in 2022) per recipient and $160,000 if spreading the gifts over five years, both without incurring a gift tax.

===Asset protection advantages===
Both federal law and many state laws confer [[Asset protection|asset protection]] advantages to both owners and beneficiaries of 529 plans. At the federal level, the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 shields from creditors 529 assets owned by a bankrupt beneficiary, provided the deposits meet certain criteria (for example, the deposits must have been made at least two years prior to bankruptcy).

Many state laws provide protections as well, and unlike the federal legislation, the state-level protections apply to claims brought outside the bankruptcy process.

Specifically, the following states provide creditor protection to both owners and beneficiaries of 529 plan assets: Alaska, Arkansas, Colorado, Florida, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Virginia, and West Virginia. Louisiana and Wisconsin have laws protecting beneficiaries of 529 plans but not owners.&lt;ref&gt;[https://prosperitynow.org/resources/state-creditor-protections-529-plans-seed-working-paper State Creditor Protections for 529 Plans], CFED Policy and Practice Working Paper. &lt;/ref&gt;

==529 plans and financial aid==
For financial aid purposes, both 529 Savings Plans and 529 Prepaid Tuition Plans are considered parental assets, if owned by the parent for the benefit of a child. Parental assets are subject to a maximum 5.64% valuation assessment in federal needs analysis. Student assets are assessed at a flat 20% rate. A 529 owned by  a student is counted as a student asset.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finaid.org/savings/529plans.phtml Section 529 Plans], FinAid &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finaid.org/savings/accountownership.phtml Account Ownership], FinAid &lt;/ref&gt;

== Applicability to primary and secondary education==
The 2017 Tax reform allows funds in 529 plans to be used for primary and secondary (K-12) education in public, private and parochial schools. In 2018, up to $10,000 from 529 plans can be used for primary and tuition expenses per child. While distribution of funds from 529 plans for primary and secondary school tuition are free from federal taxes, the treatment of these distributions with respect to state taxes depends on the state.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.savingforcollege.com/article/529-savings-plans-and-private-school-tuition 529 savings plans and private school tuition], Saving for College &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.kiplinger.com/article/investing/T002-C000-S002-using-a-529-plan-to-pay-for-private-school.html Using a 529 Plan to Pay for Private School], Kiplinger &lt;/ref&gt;

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' include the rollover of one [[529 plans|529 plan]] to another; the transfer of other college savings vehicles, such as [[Coverdell Education Savings Accounts|Coverdell Education Accounts]], [[I savings bonds|series I/EE savings bonds]], and [[Uniform Gift to Minors Act|Unified Gift to Minors custodial accounts]] to a 529 savings plan; as well as the transferring of beneficiaries and the ownership interest in the plan.

==529 plan to 529 plan rollovers==

There are any number of reasons you might want to transfer a 529 plan. You might wish to move the plan from a high cost plan to a low cost plan; you might move to a state that offers generous tax incentives for contributions to a 529 savings plan and you wish to consolidate your plan holdings in your new state's plan; you might want to exchange from your state's [[529 plans#529 Prepaid Plans |529 prepaid plan]] to your state's [[529 plans#529 College Savings Plans | 529 savings plan]] or vice-versa; or the beneficiary of your plan may decide not to pursue higher education and you would like to transfer the plan's assets to another beneficiary.
{{Quote
|quote = '''Members of the beneficiary's family.''' 
The beneficiary's family includes the beneficiary's spouse and the following other relatives of the beneficiary.

:#Son, daughter, stepchild, foster child, adopted child, or a descendant of any of them.
:#Brother, sister, stepbrother, or stepsister.
:#Father or mother or ancestor of either.
:#Stepfather or stepmother.
:#Son or daughter of a brother or sister.
:# Brother or sister of father or mother.
:#Son-in-law, daughter-in-law, father-in-law, mother-in-law, brother-in-law, or sister-in-law.
:#The spouse of any individual listed above.
:#First cousin.

}}
You are allowed to rollover one 529 plan into another 529 plan. If a rollover conforms to the following conditions you will pay no tax on the transfer:
:#You are allowed only one rollover to another 529 plan per twelve month period for the same beneficiary.
:#You are allowed to rollover a 529 plan to a family member of the beneficiary. There is no restriction on the number of times this can occur per twelve month period.
:#The rollover must occur within 60 days of the distribution for the distribution to not be considered a taxable distribution. 
:#You are also allowed to change the beneficiary of a 529 plan as long as the new beneficiary is a member of the family of the old beneficiary. There is no restriction on the number of times this can occur per twelve month period. If you change the beneficiary to a generation below the generation of the old beneficiary, there may be gift tax implications.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finaid.org/savings/529plans.phtml Section 529 Plans], FinAid &lt;/ref&gt; 

More and more 529 savings plans are accommodating direct plan to plan transfers, without liquidating the plan and sending you a check. While this direct transfer exchange mirrors the trustee-to-trustee exchange of retirement plans, the 529 plans strictly reside in the rollover world. In order to avoid a taxable distribution you must finalize the transfer transaction within 60 days, and you must abide by the rollover limitations listed above. Also keep in mind that some states impose a [[529 plan recapture tax on rollovers | recapture tax]] on past tax deductions for out of state rollovers.

==Transfers for I/EE bonds and Coverdell ESAs into 529 savings plans==
If the 529 plan accepts them, redeeming [[I savings bonds |I/EE savings bonds]] or taking distribution of a [[Coverdell Education Savings Accounts | Coverdell Education Savings Account]] and contributing the proceeds to a 529 plan is considered a qualified educational expense. In order to qualify for a tax-free transfer, both the redemption of funds and the rollover to the 529 plan  must take place within the same calendar year.

===I/EE savings bond transfers===
If you meet all of the conditions for qualifying for the [[I savings bonds#Tax-free growth for Qualified Education Expenses | savings bond qualified education expense exclusion]], you can roll the qualified redemption proceeds into a 529 savings plan.The savings bond educational interest exclusion is filed on [http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f8815.pdf IRS Form 8815]. Write "529 College Savings Plan" in the answer to 1(b), where it asks for the name of the educational institution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finaid.org/savings/529plans.phtml#Contributions FinAid Section 529 Plans]&lt;/ref&gt;. The 529 plan will require you to provide a breakdown of principal and interest of the bonds when you  make the transfer. For savings bonds, this can be accomplished by sending the plan a copy of Form 8815 or a copy of the [http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1099int.pdf 1099-INT form] you will have received from the institution that redeemed the bonds. Supplying this information to the 529 plan is critical. If the plan does not receive this breakdown between principal and interest, it will account the transfer as consisting entirely of earnings which are subject to income tax and a 10% additional tax if withdrawn as a non-qualifying withdrawal from the 529 plan. The principal is not taxed in a 529 plan withdrawal. 

===Coverdell ESA transfer=== 

To make a transfer of a Coverdell ESA to a 529 savings plan you would follow these steps:

:#Request a withdrawal from the Coverdell ESA
:#Contribute funds to a 529 plan for the same beneficiary.
:#Treat the Coverdell withdrawal as a tax-free "qualified distribution" on the beneficiary's income tax return. 

When you take a distribution from a Coverdell ESA you will receive a [http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1099q.pdf Form 1009-Q (2008)]. For transfers from a Coverdell Education Savings Account, provide the 529 plan with an account statement issued by the financial institution that acted as trustee or custodian showing contributions and earnings (or losses) in the account.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.virginia529.com/Documents/Program_Guide.pdf Virginia 529 Plan document]&lt;/ref&gt; Supplying this information to the 529 plan is critical. If the plan does not receive this breakdown between basis and gain/(loss), it will account the transfer as consisting entirely of earnings which are subject to income tax and a 10% additional tax if withdrawn as a non-qualifying withdrawal from the 529 plan. The principal is not taxed in a 529 plan withdrawal.

==Uniform Gifts to Minors (UGMA) or Uniform Transfers to Minors Act (UTMA) transfer to a 529 plan==
{{Quote
|quote     = "'''Uniform Gift to Minors Act (UGMA)'''
An act that allows minors to own property such as securities. The IRS allows persons to give so many thousands of dollars to another person without any tax consequences. If this recipient person is a minor, the UGMA allows the minor to own the assets without an attorney setting up a special trust fund. Under the UGMA, the ownership of the funds works like it does with any other trust except that the donor must appoint a custodian (the trustee) to look after the account.
The donor can appoint him/herself or another person to be custodian. The custodian, who has a fiduciary duty to manage the minor's assets wisely, can use the funds to buy securities on behalf of the minor. Access to the gift must be given to the minor when he or she reaches the age of majority, either 18 or 21 (sometimes even 25), depending on UGMA state law. Should a donor acting as the custodian die before the custodial property is transferred to the minor, the entire custodial property is included in the donor's taxable estate. 

'''Uniform Transfers to Minors Act (UTMA)'''

An extension of the Uniform Gifts to Minors Act that allows items other than cash or securities to be considered gifts. Other gifts that minors can receive include real estate, art, patents and royalties." 
|source    = -- ''[http://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/ugma.asp Investopedia (UGMA)]
}}
Not all states allow the transfer of [[Uniform Gift to Minors Act | Uniform Gifts to Minors]] (UGMA) or Uniform Transfers to Minors Act (UTMA) accounts to a 529 Plan. (See side quote box for a definition of these custodial accounts designed for holding a minor's assets). But for those that accept them, the IRS deems such a transfer a qualified educational expense. Due to the restrictive characteristics of a UGMA/UTMA, you can not transfer this account into a typical 529 savings plan. The transfer must be to a custodial 529 savings plan. Each state has its distinctive requirements for UGMA accounts, but the following  essential restrictions apply to custodial 529 plans. You must refer to your state's custodial 529 plan for specific requirements:

:# The beneficiary cannot be changed (directly or by means of a rollover) except as permitted by UGMA/UTMA.
:# The custodian should not change the  Account Owner to anyone other than a successor custodian.
:# The beneficiary of the custodial 529 plan must be the beneficiary's estate.
:# Upon the beneficiary reaching majority (commonly age 18 or 21), the custodianship of the plan terminates and the beneficiary becomes the account owner.

Common reasons for transferring UGMA/UMTA custodial accounts to a custodial 529 savings plan are:
:*''' Tax Savings:''' If the UGMA/UMTA custodial account is primarily intended for meeting college expenses, a transfer to a custodial 529 savings plan will allow tax free distribution of the account for qualified education expenses.
:*''' Financial Aid:''' If the beneficiary is your dependent, a custodial 529 plan is considered a parental asset for financial aid purposes. UGMA/UTMA custodial accounts are considered student assets. Parental assets are subject to a maximum 5.64% valuation assessment in federal needs analysis; student assets are assessed at a flat 20% rate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finaid.org/savings/529plans.phtml Section 529 Plans], FinAid &lt;/ref&gt;
:*''' Control Issues:''' A custodial 529 savings plan can exert greater fiduciary control over the minor's assets than can a standard 529 savings plan.

Caveats for for transferring UGMA/UMTA custodial accounts to a custodial 529 savings plan include the following:
:*A custodial 529 plan can only accept cash deposits.  This means that UGMA/UTMA custodial assets may have to liquidated and taxed to make the transfer. UGMA/UTMA custodial assets are taxed to the child (In 2009 the first $900 of a dependent child's -below the age of 19, or 24 if a full-time student- investment income is tax-free, and the next $900 is taxed at the child's rate, which is typically 10%).  The overall tax savings for a transfer may not be compelling. In addition, with a transfer to a custodial 529 plan, any non-qualifying asset withdrawals will be subject to income tax and the 10% additional tax. Withdrawals for any purpose from a UGMA/UTMA account would likely be subject to capital gains taxes.  Vanguard provides a  [http://www.archimedes.com/vanguard/ugma.phtml UGMA/UTMA to a UGMA/UTMA 529 Calculator] which can help quantify a potential transfer. A transfer is also less compelling if applying for financial aid or exercising control issues are low priorities for the college saver.

A transfer of UGMA/UTMA custodial accounts to a custodial 529 plan is a decision that warrants assistance from a qualified professional CPA.

}}
===Beneficiary changes===
You may wish to change the beneficiary for any number of reasons (death of the beneficiary; a beneficiary's decision to forgo higher education; or a residual of plan assets after paying qualified education costs for the beneficiary). Rather than withdraw the plan assets and incur income tax on the plan's earnings and a 10% additional tax on non qualified withdrawals, it is often preferable to transfer a 529 plan to another qualifying beneficiary.

The key factor involving the changing of a 529 beneficiary is that all changes must be to a member of the beneficiary's family tree (see the sidebox, ''' Members of the beneficiary's family'''). As long as any change occurs "laterally" to the same generation as the old beneficiary, or "upwards" to an older generation, the IRS is indifferent to the transfer.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/529 26 U.S. Code § 529 - Qualified tuition programs], 529(c)(5)(B) law.cornell.edu &lt;/ref&gt;

:''Example: lateral changes''

:You have established 529 savings accounts for your son Robert and daughter Nicole. Robert decides not to attend an institution of higher learning. You then transfer the funds in Robert's 529 plan to Nicole's 529 plan. Later, when Nicole has finished her schooling, there remains a balance in the 529 plan. You now shift the beneficial interest over to Miriam, your sister's daughter (your niece and Nicole's cousin). All of these transfers occur within the generation one step below your generation.

:''Example: vertical (upward) changes''
:When your daughter Nicole has finished her schooling you shift the beneficial interest of the 529 plan to Mary, Nicole's mother, who is interested in pursuing post-graduate work. This transfer is upwards, since it moves the beneficiary from the child's generation to the mother's generation.

The IRS takes an interest in a transfer whenever the transfer involves a shift two steps down from your generation, and "skips" a generation. This skip subjects the account owner (or beneficiary) to the [[Generation-skipping transfer tax| generation-skipping transfer tax‎]]. This skip is especially pertinent to grandparent's setting up, or shifting beneficial 529 interests to grandchildren. Fortunately, the same tax exclusions applying to the basic gift tax also pertain to the generation skipping transfer tax. You are allowed an annual $15,000 ($30,000 if there is a spousal "split") exclusion to the generation skipping transfer tax. You can also exclude up to  $75,000 ($150,000 if there is a spousal "split') by electing five year forwarding of the transferred interest. Any transfer that involves a skip would benefit from the counsel of a qualified CPA.

===Ownership changes===
{{Quote
|quote = Each of the three largest mutual fund firms managing 529 plans labels the successor owner/donor differently on their account registrations:
:* [http://www.tiaa-cref.org/products/education/529/index.html TIAA-CREF] refers to the successor as the '''Contingent Account Owner''';
:* [http://personal.fidelity.com/planning/college/content/fidelity_managed_529_plans.shtml.cvsr Fidelity] refers to the successor as the '''Successor Participant (Account Owner)''';
:* [https://personal.vanguard.com/us/whatweoffer/college/finda529?Link=facet Vanguard] refers to the successor as the '''Successor Account Owner'''.
}}
A 529 plan can only have one owner (also sometimes called donor). Thus, it is very important for 529 plan holders to name a successor owner to take over the ownership rights of the plan in case of the original owner's death. Failure to name a successor will force succession to be determined by will or state intestacy laws. In the case of parental 529 plan owners, the most common successor would be the owner's spouse.

Grandparents may face a more complex decision with account succession. Grandparents ordinarily set up and donate to a 529 savings plan for young grandchildren and great grandchildren (if the younger generations are in or approaching their college years, the grandparents could simply gift immediate payment of educational costs). A grandparent ordinarily will choose a successor owner from a younger generation (usually their child as parent of the grandchild.) This designation can work fine if the grandparent trusts the parent  and in law spouse to follow their intentions over time.  However in the case of blended families, or in the instance of divorce, the grandparent's charitable wishes can be violated. This is due to the fact the the successor owner has control over the account, having the power to change beneficiaries, or even cash out the account. If such issues of control are important to a grandparent it is essential that you use a qualified estate planner to devise workable solutions.

Most 529 plans will allow a plan owner to transfer a 529 plan to a new owner, such as your spouse, child, or grandchild, without restriction (although the IRS has indicated that it is going to issue proposed regulations to stop abusive practices).&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.irs.gov/irb/2008-09_IRB/ar17.html  Guidance on Qualified Tuition Programs Under Section 529],  Internal Revenue Bulletin:  2008-9,  March 3, 2008 , Announcement 2008-17 &lt;/ref&gt;  However, a number of state plans (see table below) do restrict ownership transfers. If you want to transfer ownership of a 529 plan from a restrictive state, you should first transfer the 529 plan to a state plan that allows ownership transfers, and then execute the transfer.

In the investment world, the term '''glide path''' refers to the process by which a target date fund changes its [[Asset allocation|asset allocation]] among risky assets (which can include [[Stock basics | stocks]], [[Domestic/International | international stocks]], [[Real estate investment trust |REITs]] and [[Commodities | commodities]]) and lower risk assets such as  [[Bond basics | bonds]], [[Treasury Inflation Protected Securities | inflation indexed bonds]] and [[Money markets | money market funds]] over a time horizon. Target date funds include [[Target Retirement Funds | target retirement funds]] in the retirement plan market, as well as [[529 plans#529 Plan Investment Programs | age-adjusted portfolios]] in the college savings plan market. The glide path of a target fund shifts from high risky equity allocations at inception to ever higher fixed income investments as the target date approaches.

==Target retirement funds glide paths==

Target retirement funds almost universally begin with high equity allocations for young investors. However each fund group establishes a glide path for its series of target funds, and these glide paths vary considerably. In general, however, a fund's glide path will follow one of three methods: straight line, stepped, or rolldown.

:1. '''Straight Line''':  A straight line glide path takes a steady, linear approach that gradually reduces the equity weighting of the portfolio over time. [[The Vanguard Group |Vanguard]] and [[TIAA-CREF]] take this approach.&lt;ref&gt;Vanguard outlines their approach and reasoning to glide paths [https://personal.vanguard.com/pdf/icrtdf.pdf Vanguard’s approach to target-date funds] &lt;/ref&gt;

Target retirement fund managers justify high equity allocations for young investors on the grounds that a long time horizon allows the investor plenty of time to recover from the down cycles of markets and  that the large amount of human capital (future lifetime earnings)  the young investor possesses provides the investor ample opportunities for increasing the personal savings rate when the markets decline. In the meantime the investor can garner a greater percentage of the expected equity return premium over an investment career by holding the higher equity allocation. While a target date's glide path will slowly reduce the equity allocation over the lifetime of the investor, target date funds ordinarily hold a considerable allocation to equity investments as an investor approaches retirement age. These allocations are attributable to the fact that most target retirement funds are designed to be held through the planned retirement date and held over the entire period of the investor's retirement phase. Firms with high post retirement  equity allocations base their asset allocation decision on the expected increased longevity of post retirement accounts. The lengthened time horizon allows time for recovery from market down cycles during the early stage of retirement, and, assuming a realization of an expected equity return premium, the portfolio will have a higher value to help mitigate the risk of having reduced income at the end of a long life.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www2.troweprice.com/rms/rps/Sponsors/DefaultContent/StaticAssets/Revisiting_TRP_Asset_Alloc_GP_Strategy.pdf Revisiting T. Rowe Price’s Asset Allocation Glide-Path Strategy]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The dispersion of equity allocations in the universe of target retirement funds is a narrow 2.5% in the 2055 series of target date funds. This dispersion of equity allocations widens to 40%-50% as the target series approaches the retirement years. For example, the range of equity allocation in 2010 target date funds falls between a low 26% allocation in the Wells Fargo Advantage 2010 fund and a high 72% allocation in the Alliance Bernstein 2010 fund. Figure 4. illustrates the diversity of glide path allocations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://corporate.morningstar.com/US/documents/MethodologyDocuments/ResearchPapers/TargetDateFundSeries_IndustrySurvey.pdf Target-Date Series Research Paper: 2009 Industry Survey,] pp.7-8&lt;/ref&gt;

The divergence in asset allocation resulted in a wide dispersion of returns in the 2008 market collapse. Losses in the 2010 target fund series ranged from -9% to -41%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://advisor.morningstar.com/articles/article.asp?s=0&amp;docId=17632&amp;pgNo=1 Five Concerns About Target-Date Funds], John Rackenthaler, Morningstar Advisor, 10-31-2009 &lt;/ref&gt; Clearly, two funds bearing the same target date can have markedly different portfolio allocations, risk exposures, and returns.

==Target retirement fund indexes==
[[File:Morningstarglidepaths.png|thumb|right|451px]]
Index providers Dow Jones, Standard &amp; Poor's, and Morningstar have developed indexes for benchmarking target retirement fund portfolios.  Dow Jones and Morningstar employ risk based metrics in devising the index glide path.  S&amp;P attempts to mirror the glide paths used by the actual target funds comprising the market.The Index glide path methodologies are outlined below:

:*'''Dow Jones Target Date Indexes ''': Glide path follows a monthly equity risk exposure reduction formula, from 90% to 20% of the total equity risk.&lt;ref name="Methodologies"&gt;[http://corporate.morningstar.com/us/documents/Indexes/TargetDateIndexComparison.pdf Target Date Index Comparison Grid]&lt;/ref&gt;
:*'''S&amp;P Target Date Indexes''': Glide path is a scrubbed average of nearly all active Target Date fund equity allocations – consensus glide path is the objective.&lt;ref name="Methodologies"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
:*'''Morningstar Target Date Indexes''': Modern Portfolio Theory-based asset allocation, optimized to human capital asset assumptions. Liability-driven investment (LDI) approach using investor balance sheet construct for surplus optimization. Indexes are provided for three risk profiles: conservative, moderate, and aggressive.&lt;ref name="Methodologies"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

The following table provides the Index equity targets for selective ages: a youthful starting date; a date ten years prior to a common retirement date; a common retirement age; and a date five years after retirement. The glide paths of the seven largest mutual fund managers is also provided in the table. The benchmark indexes can help investors gauge the relative riskiness of a given target retirement fund's guide path strategy.

==College savings plans glide paths==
The time horizon for a child's college savings is bounded by the assumed ages of college enrollment (18-22). The glide paths of 529 Savings Plan age-adjusted portfolios are therefore usually much more conservative than those used in the retirement plan market. Many plans transition portfolios to hold 100% cash or 100% cash/fixed income portfolios at age 18+. However, as in the retirement plan market, there is a wide variance in the range of stock allocations for the 18-22 age period. Many 529 savings plans offer risk-based portfolios (Conservative, Moderate, and Aggressive) and the equity allocations for the 18+ age group in many aggressive portfolios range from 10% equity to 65% equity.&lt;ref name="study"&gt;[http://www.savingforcollege.com/articles/savingforcollegecoms-age-based-allocation-study-nov-2008 Savingforcollege.com’s age-based allocation study (Nov 2008)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The following table shows the glide path allocations for the three largest 529 Plan vendors in the direct market 529 plan universe, Vanguard, TIAA-CREF, and Fidelity. The allocations are provided for equity investments, fixed income investments, and money market fund investments.

Many Vanguard 529 plans follow the glide path illustrated in the table. However some states (Illinois and Indiana) hold a 10% equity allocation in the 18+ age band. Iowa, Missouri, Nebraska, and North Carolina supply a 20% equity allocation in the aggressive allocation portfolios. Utah's option 3, the most aggressive allocation in that state's plan, holds a 65% equity allocation at age 18.&lt;ref name="study"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Individual retirement portfolios and glide paths==

As mentioned  in [[Withdrawal methods#Constant-dollar (age in bonds)|bond percentage equal to your age]], many people prefer not to keep a static stock/bond allocation throughout their retirement, but to gradually have their portfolio become more conservative by reducing the stock allocation and increasing the bond allocation as they age. However, the rule-of-thumb method where your bond percentage is equal to your age is sometimes seen as a bit too conservative. Another method, similar to the allocations used by some retirement-date funds is to follow a ''glide-path'' allocation change that isn't necessarily directly linear, as is the bonds=age method. Often, a glide-path method will add bonds to the portfolio mix more slowly in the early years before retirement, thus allowing the portfolio more possibility for growth before retirement. Then, after retirement, the glide-path may transition more quickly to a bond-heavy allocation, thus shielding the portfolio from stock market volatility during later retirement years.
Figure 4 shows a graph comparing the ''(100-age)'' stock allocation and the ''Log(100-age)-1'' glide-path allocation. The blue (100-age) line is linear, changing the allocation by 1% each year. The glide-path allocation changes more slowly in the earlier years, presumably allowing for more portfolio growth during the accumulation years, and then turns quicker towards a more conservative allocation during the retirement years, eventually becoming more conservative and following a 100% bond allocation for age 90 and later.

|}   &lt;!-- end of table --&gt;

As with the similar [[Withdrawal methods##Constant-dollar (age in bonds)|''bond percentage equal to your age'']] method, following a glide-path stock/bond allocation allows the overall portfolio to become more conservative each year. The results, shown in Figure 6, are similar to the ''bonds equal age ''method, but in the time-period shown in the graph, the slower transition to bonds allowed the overall portfolio to grow a bit more, resulting in slightly more money being withdrawn from the portfolio, while retaining a similar volatility.

A 529A plan is similar to a [[529 plan]] in that earnings on the contributions are tax deferred and tax-free when withdrawn to pay for qualified expenses for an eligible individual. A 529A plan (qualified ABLE program) must be sponsored by a state. The signing of the PATH Act in 2015 removed residency requirements from 529 ABLE accounts, giving individuals the option of using any state's plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kathryn Flynn|url=https://www.savingforcollege.com/articles/new-tax-bill-brings-improvements-to-education-benefits-882|title=New tax bill brings improvements to education benefits|publisher=savingforcollege.com|date=Dec 12, 2015|accessdate=Jan 13, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

There can be only one 529A plan for a beneficiary (eligible individual), and total contributions in a year are generally limited to the annual exclusion amount under the gift tax laws. But, starting in 2018, if the beneficiary works, the beneficiary can also contribute part or all of what they make to their ABLE account (limits apply).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/tax-reform-allows-people-with-disabilities-to-put-more-money-into-able-accounts-expands-eligibility-for-savers-credit|title=Tax reform allows people with disabilities to put more money into ABLE accounts, expands eligibility for Saver’s Credit|publisher=IRS|date=June 15, 2018|accessdate=Jan 13, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; States must apply the same limit on aggregate accumulations to their 529A plan that they apply to their 529 plans. 

==Qualified ABLE program==
529A plans must be established and administered by the individual states. This is similar to the administration of 529 savings plan programs. The plans can only accept cash contributions and may not be used as a security for a loan.

Designated beneficiaries are limited to having only one 529A plan. There are no residency requirements from 529 ABLE accounts, giving individuals the option of using any state's plan. However, some state plans are restricted to state residents, and some states provide tax incentives to state residents.

529A plans allow tax-free rollovers from one state plan to another should the designated beneficiary move to a different state.&lt;ref group="note"&gt; Tax-free rollovers of 529A plans are also permitted if the designated beneficiary is changed and the new beneficiary is an eligible individual for such taxable year and a member of the family of the former beneficiary.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eligible individual and designated beneficiary==
An eligible individual is someone who became blind or disabled before the age of 26 (increasing to 46 in 2026&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/05/your-money/able-disability-savings-accounts.html NYT - Savings Accounts for Disabled People Are Expanding. Do You Qualify?]&lt;/ref&gt;) and is entitled to benefits because of blindness or disability either from [[Social Security]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.ssa.gov/OP_Home/rulings/di/01/SSR83-20-di-01.html| title=SSR 83-20 (Rescinded)| publisher=SSA| accessdate=October 31, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a state plan authorized under Title XVI of the Social Security Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.ssa.gov/OP_Home/ssact/title16a/1600.htm| title=Social Security Act Title XVI| publisher=SSA| accessdate=October 31, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt; Someone can also be certified eligible if a claim is made based on a physician's diagnosis that the impairment began before the age of 26 and will result in death or has lasted or will last at least 12 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.congress.gov/113/bills/hr5771/BILLS-113hr5771enr.xml#HEE6EFB4483074DD6A5F76C1B49D45073| title=H. R. 5771 (Enrolled-Bill), 529A plan Section 102(e)| publisher=Congress.gov| accessdate=October 31, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ABLE Age Adjustment Act increases the age from before 26 to before 46, as of January 1, 2026.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.ablenrc.org/the-able-age-adjustment-act-fact-sheet/| title=The ABLE Age Adjustment Act Fact Sheet| publisher=ABLE National Resource Center| accessdate=October 31, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The designated beneficiary of a plan is the eligible individual who established the plan and is the owner of the plan. Unlike a 529 plan, the owner and beneficiary of a 529A plan are one and the same.

==Qualified expense==
Qualified disability expenses are defined as any expenses related to the eligible individual’s blindness or disability which are made for the benefit of an eligible individual who is the designated beneficiary.

Qualifying expenses include the following: 
* Education;
* Housing;
* Transportation;
* Employment training and support;
* Assistive technology and personal support services:
* Health, prevention and wellness;
* Financial management and administrative services:
* Legal fees, expenses for oversight and monitoring;
* Funeral and burial expenses;
* Other approved expenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.congress.gov/113/bills/hr5771/BILLS-113hr5771enr.xml#HEE6EFB4483074DD6A5F76C1B49D45073| title=H. R. 5771 (Enrolled-Bill), 529A plan Section 102(e)(5), Qualified disability expenses| publisher=Congress.gov| accessdate=October 31, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contribution limits==
===Effect of 2017 tax reform===
The 2017 Tax Reform (Tax Cuts and Jobs Act) introduced three changes to 529A plans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-reminds-those-with-disabilities-of-new-able-account-benefits| title=IRS reminds those with disabilities of new ABLE account benefits| publisher=IRS| accessdate=October 31, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/government-entities/federal-state-local-governments/able-accounts-tax-benefit-for-people-with-disabilities| title=ABLE accounts - Tax benefit for people with disabilities| publisher=IRS| accessdate=October 31, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting 2018, the designated beneficiary can contributed funds beyond the annual gift-tax exclusion limit. This additional contribution is limited to the poverty-line amount for a one-person household. The designated beneficiary is not, however, eligible to make this additional contribution if their employer contributes to a workplace retirement plan on their behalf.

Also, starting in 2018, 529A account beneficiaries can qualify for the [[Saver's credit]] based on contributions they make to their 529A accounts.

Finally, starting 2018, some funds may be rolled into a 529A account from the designated beneficiary’s own 529 plan or from the 529 plan of certain family members.

The annual limit amount is an aggregate of all contributions to an account during the year. Thus, for example, a grandparent and a parent can contribute to a plan, but the combined contributions cannot exceed the annual limit. The contributions are treated as a completed gift to the designated beneficiary.

In addition, as of 2025, an ABLE Account Owner who resides in the continental U.S. and who works and does NOT participate in an employer sponsored retirement plan – within that calendar year – may contribute up to an additional $15,060 from their earnings into their ABLE account. It is higher for residents of Alaska: $18,810 and Hawaii: $17,310.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.ablenrc.org/able-account-contribution-limits-2025/| title=ABLE Account Contribution Limits (2025)| publisher=ABLE National Resource Center| accessdate=November 15, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

529A plans will share the same maximum account accumulation limits that states have set for their 529 savings plans.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;You can find the maximum accumulation limits for state 529 plans at [https://www.savingforcollege.com/compare-529-plans/results?plan_question_id=308&amp;plan_type_id=1 Savingforcollege.com].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tax considerations==
529A accounts provide for valuable tax benefits, but there are also tax penalties imposed on both non-qualifying account distributions and on excess account contributions. 

===Federal tax benefits===
Contributions to a 529A account are made with after-tax dollars, but the investment inside the account grows without annual taxation. Qualified disability withdrawals are free from federal taxation.

===Federal tax penalties===
529A accounts are subject to two federal tax penalties: a penalty tax on non-qualified distributions, and an excise tax on excess contributions.

====Tax on non-qualified distributions====
Distributions over the qualified disablility expenses will be subject to income tax and a 10 percent penalty tax. The amount includible in gross income is the excess amount reduced by an amount in the same ratio as the expenses bear to the distributions.

{{blockquote|Example: A qualified ABLE account with a balance of $100,000 (of which $50,000 consists of contributions) distributes $10,000 to a beneficiary who has incurred $6,000 of qualified disability expenses. The $5,000 ($10,000 - $5,000 basis) amount otherwise includible in gross income is reduced by $3,000 ($6,000 / $10,000 multiplied by $5,000), so the includible amount is $2,000. An additional tax of $200 (10 percent of $2,000) is imposed on the distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.taxccllc.com/SiteAssets/tax/accouting/business-set-up/financial-planning/tax-planning/ABLE%2520Program.pdf| title=ABLE Program| publisher=Christensen Consulting, LLC| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150218162751/https://www.taxccllc.com/SiteAssets/tax/accouting/business-set-up/financial-planning/tax-planning/ABLE%20Program.pdf| archive-date=February 18, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The 10 percent penalty does not apply if the payment or distribution is made to a beneficiary (or to the estate of the designated beneficiary) on or after the death of the designated beneficiary. Any earnings distributed to the estate or the beneficiary are subject to federal income tax.

====Tax on excess contributions====
If an excess contribution to a 529A account is not withdrawn, the account owner will be accessed a 6 percent excise tax. The excise tax can be negated if a corrective distribution of the excess contribution is made on or before the day (including extensions of time) for filing the account owner's individual tax return for that tax year. The corrective distribution must include any earnings attributable to the contribution. These earnings will be subject to income tax, but will not be accessed the 10 percent penalty tax.

==Effects on Social Security and Medicaid==
The 529A plan allows a designated beneficiary to retain access to means-tested federal aid programs such as [[Planning for disabled adult children#Supplemental Security Income (SSI)|Supplemental Security Income (SSI)]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.ssa.gov/ssi| title=Supplemental Security Income (SSI)| publisher=SSA| accessdate=October 31, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Planning for disabled adult children#Medicaid|Medicaid]]. However, there are limitations that can result in the lowering or suspension of SSI benefits. These limiting factors include:
 
# While payments for housing costs by third parties are typically included in SSI countable income, for an ABLE account they are considered a qualified disability expense and are allowed, because the ABLE account is treated as being owned by the beneficiary.  However, money distributed for housing must be spent in the same month as the distribution, or else it does become countable income, which will reduce the SSI payment. &lt;ref group="note"&gt;SSA POMS SI 01130.740:

“A distribution from an ABLE account is not income to the designated beneficiary, regardless of whether it is for a qualified disability expense.”

“If the distribution is retained after the month of receipt, it may count as a resource.”

IRS 26 CFR §1.529A-1(c)(15):

“Qualified disability expenses include housing expenses…”&lt;/ref&gt;
# SSI benefits are suspended whenever the 529A plan assets exceed $100,000; benefits resume once plan assets fall back to $100,000 or less.

A 529A plan will have no impact on Medicaid eligibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.congress.gov/113/bills/hr5771/BILLS-113hr5771enr.xml#toc-HC225BAA081CB4C82A5E4A4F4E1C93279| title=H. R. 5771 (Enrolled-Bill), 529A plan Section 103| publisher=Congress.gov| accessdate=October 31, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon the death of the designated beneficiary, the state will have a creditor claim for the repayment of any net medical assistance received from Medicaid,&lt;ref group="note"&gt; A working disabled individual can continue to receive state Medicaid benefits by using the Medicaid Buy-in Program. The repayment of Medicaid benefits after the death of the 529A plan designated beneficiary will be the Medicaid benefits received minus any premiums paid.&lt;/ref&gt; after the establishment of the account. Several states have passed laws limiting Medicaid recovery from ABLE accounts for in state residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.abletoday.org/faqs| title=FAQs — ABLE today| publisher=ABLE today| accessdate=October 31, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bankruptcy==
529A plans are afforded asset protection against bankruptcy claims. Contributions to a plan are not subject to creditor claims if they were made 721 days prior to the filing of bankruptcy proceedings. Contributions made up to 364 days before the filing are subject to creditor claims. For contributions made between 365 and 720 days inclusive prior to filing, a maximum of $6,225 is exempt from creditor claims.
For an individual under the supervision of the bankruptcy code, contributions to a 529A plan can continue to be paid as a part of a debtor's allowable monthly expenses, as long as they are not excess contributions and the designated beneficiary of the account is a child, stepchild, grandchild, or stepgrandchild of the debtor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.congress.gov/113/bills/hr5771/BILLS-113hr5771enr.xml#toc-H7AAC6C990595434880DCE4E74BFAE0E1| title=H. R. 5771 (Enrolled-Bill), 529A plan Section 104| publisher=Congress.gov| accessdate=October 31, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investment direction for 529-A plans==
529A accounts enable participants to make twice-yearly investment changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.congress.gov/113/bills/hr5771/BILLS-113hr5771enr.xml#toc-H1FD39ED5F00346FC8CF914FD7EED3DDC| title=H.

==Advantages of in-state plans compared to out-of-state plans==

In most states you can choose between your home state plan or one of many out of state plans. The advantages of each are as follows:

Advantages of in-state plans:

* In some states that have a state income tax, the state may also offer a state income tax deduction for at least part of the 529-ABLE deduction. This varies by state.
* There are some states that limit Medicaid clawback provisions, but only for in-state plans.
* Some states provide creditor protections for 529-ABLE accounts. The protections for in-state plans may exceed the protections for out-of-state plans. This also varies widely by state.
* Local and home agencies may be more familiar with in-state plans than out-of-state:

Advantages of out-of-state plans:

* Given there are so many out-of-state options, it is likely that one of the out-of-state plans has a better overall plan in terms of investment options or assessed fees.
* If you have most of your investments in one brokerage like Fidelity or Vanguard, you may find it more convenient to use the plan that your brokerage works with.

A '''Coverdell Education Savings Account (ESA)''', established by Section 530 in the IRS Code,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/530 |title=26 U.S. Code § 530 - Coverdell education savings accounts| publisher=Legal Information Institute|access-date=July 15, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a tax deferred account dedicated to saving for education expenses. This benefit applies to both qualified higher education expenses as well as to qualified elementary and secondary education expenses.

Similar to a [[Roth IRA]], contributions to a Coverdell ESA are not deductible, but amounts deposited in the account grow tax free until distributed. The beneficiary will not owe tax on the distributions if they are less than a beneficiary’s qualified education expenses at an eligible institution.

==Contributions== 

For a contribution to be eligible under the program, the beneficiary must be under age 18 or qualify as a special needs beneficiary. The ESA must distribute all funds to the beneficiary by age 30, although the beneficial interest in the ESA can always be transferred to another qualifying beneficiary. The total contributions for a beneficiary are limited to $2,000 in any year, no matter how many accounts have been established. If you have more than one beneficiary, you can set up separate accounts for each, with each one having their own $2,000 annual contribution limit. There are income limits applying to contributors to a Coverdell ESA, and these can reduce or even eliminate the annual $2,000 limit.&lt;ref name="pub970"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.irs.gov/publications/p970| title=Publication 970, Tax Benefits for Education| publisher=IRS| accessdate=July 15, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anyone, including grandparents, parents, children, and relatives, can contribute into a Coverdell ESA for a beneficiary, provided that no more than the annual $2,000 dollar limit is contributed and that all contributors fall within income limitations. Special care must be taken for multiple accounts established for a beneficiary by different donors (for example, a parent and a grandparent) that the $2,000 annual limit is not exceeded, since excess contributions are subject to a 6% excise tax.&lt;ref name="pub970" /&gt;

==Advantages==

* Tax free growth similar to a Roth IRA.
* The person creating the account can select the fiduciary and management firm that will hold and invest the funds deposited into the program. They are free to choose a low cost investment firm with a wide selection of investment choices, which is distinct over other educational savings programs. Details on the [[Vanguard Coverdell Education Savings Account]] are covered in a separate page.&lt;ref name="esas"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.savingforcollege.com/coverdell-esas| title=Coverdell Education Savings Accounts| publisher=Saving For College| accessdate=July 15, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Account ownership== 
The Coverdell ESA is structured as a trust or custodial account for a beneficiary. The funds invested must be administered and distributed for the benefit of the beneficiary. Because the beneficiary is usually a minor, a "responsible individual," almost invariably a parent or guardian, must administer the account. In this context it is important to point out that grandparents or relatives establishing an ESA for a grandchild or nephew or niece must name the parent or guardian of the child beneficiary the responsible agent. Contributions to a Coverdell ESA are considered gifts that qualify under the annual gift tax exclusion.&lt;ref name="esas" /&gt; This means that in years in which you make a Coverdell contribution for somebody's benefit, you need to reduce other gifts (such as [[529 plan]]s) to that beneficiary appropriately if you wish to avoid the gift tax.

==Distributing the account==
Distributions from a Coverdell ESA are tax free if used for qualifying educational expenses. Qualified expenses include: 
* Tuition, room and board;
* Fees, books, supplies, and computer-related technology equipment.

When applying for federal financial aid, the ESA account is considered an asset of the account custodian, typically the parent.

Distributions from an ESA can be combined with the American Opportunity and Lifetime Learning tax credits to cover qualified education costs, but the same cost can not be covered by both the ESA and the credit.&lt;ref name="IRS tax tip"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.irs.gov:80/newsroom/article/0,,id=107636,00.html| title=IRS Tax Tip 2008-59| publisher=IRS| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120806061459/http://www.irs.gov:80/newsroom/article/0,,id=107636,00.html| archive-date=August 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/american-opportunity-tax-credit-questions-and-answers|title= American Opportunity Tax Credit: Questions and Answers| publisher=IRS |access-date=July 15, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.irs.gov/credits-deductions/individuals/llc|title= Lifetime Learning Credit| publisher= IRS|access-date=July 15, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.eitc.irs.gov/other-refundable-credits-toolkit/compare-education-credits-and-tuition-and-fees-deduction/compare|title= Compare Education Credits and Tuition and Fees Deduction| publisher= IRS|access-date=July 15, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The combination of disbursements and credits may make a portion of the disbursement taxable to the beneficiary. Generally, if distributions are above the qualified expenses, the beneficiary pays income tax on the earnings plus a 10% penalty tax. The penalty tax is waived in the instances of:
* Death or disability of the beneficiary;
* The beneficiary receives an income scholarship, Pell Grant, or benefits under a qualifying employer-provided educational assistance program;
* The part of a distribution made taxable by using the Hope and Lifetime earnings credits.&lt;ref name="IRS tax tip" /&gt;

The Coverdell ESA must generally be distributed within 30 days of the beneficiary reaching age 30, The portion representing earnings on the account will be taxable and subject to the additional 10% tax. The beneficiary may avoid these taxes by rolling over the full balance to another family member under the age of thirty. In cases of death, the account is distributed to the estate of the beneficiary and income tax is owed on the earnings, with no penalty tax. The income tax can be avoided by changing the beneficiary to a surviving spouse or other qualifying family member. As these tax factors can become quite involved, you should consult IRS Publication 970&lt;ref name="pub970" /&gt; for details.

==Tax documents==
For any year in which you make a contribution, rollover, or trustee to trustee transfer into a Coverdell ESA you should receive a Form 5498-ESA from your investment company fiduciary:
*[https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-5498-esa About Form 5498-ESA, Coverdell ESA Contribution Information]

For any year in which a distribution is made from the ESA, the beneficiary should receive a Form 1009-Q from your investment company fiduciary:
*[https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-1099-q About Form 1099-Q, Payments from Qualified Education Programs (Under Sections 529 and 530)]
